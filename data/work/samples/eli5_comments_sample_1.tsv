The Communists won the fight, and took control of the country, now known as the People's Republic of China. The Nationalists, refusing to partake in a Communist society, fled to the island of Taiwan, which is claimed in name by the PRC but has a ton of political and economic sovereignty. To this day there's bad blood between the two countries.

Tibet is another story. When the PRC took control of the country, they sought to industrialize quickly and have a modern society up and running, so they used all the land and resources possible and pushed the Chinese borders as far as possible. There are many peoples in China ethnically different from Han Chinese (what we typically think of when we hear ""Chinese""), including the Tibetans. They wanted their own land and sovereignty, and they were also persecuted due to their Buddhist beliefs (the PRC is atheist, and Mao's government worked to rid the country of beliefs like Buddhism and especially Confucianism).

Simply speaking, every other nation in the world has two choices: recognize Beijing aka mainland China, or recognize Taiwan. Due to a largely overwhelming series of circumstances, most nations of the world recognize Beijing over Taiwan.

1) China can be the PEOPLE's republic of the China. That is the official definition after 1970. Currently, most of the world recognize PRC as the official China. It was funded in 1949 by the communist.


2) China can be the Republic of China. It was the China that fought with the US against the Japanese during WW II. This China run by Democracy after 1980s. It was funded in 1911 by the Nationalist (KMT).

Both China agrees Senkaku Islands, Tibet and Taiwan along with the main-land are part of China. PRC doesn't control Taiwan. ROC does not control the main-land. PRC gives up its claim on Mongolia, but not ROC. Both China claims Senkaku Islands, but neither controls it. It is a mess.

For convince, people call PRC China and call ROC Taiwan. Therefore, technically speaking Taiwan (is not a country) is not a proper name for ROC. PRC does not recognize Taiwan as a country. But some people (the separatists) in Taiwan, wishing Taiwan to be an independent county, call Taiwan Taiwan (thus forgo being China).  It is confusing, isn't it.

As for Tibet, It was part of China since 1600s. After 1911 it remains its independence but recognized ROC as it overlord and was allowed self governing while remaining as part of China. In 1949, PRC moves in and disbanded the self-governing and disallowed religion. Massacre took place to kill all the monks and freed all the monk's slaves. With CIA's help, Dalai Lama (currently under CIA payroll) escaped Tibet and started a separatist movement. However, Dalai Lama refuses to used force to seek independence and even denies separatist movement. He wants the people of Tibet to have free election and to choose side themselves.

***

One:

 Communist party did not go to War with the Nationalists when it was led by Sun Yat Sun. Sun Yat Sun is always considered a good guy in Communist history books, thus his portryal in movies like ""Bodyguard and Assassins."" The bad blood occured due to

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_massacre_of_1927

After Chiang Shek took over the party. Whereby he grew weary of the communists influence and ordered a surprise massacre of communist forces (at this time, communists and nationalists were allied in the unification of champion from independent warlords).


***

Two:

The main reason PRC reconquared China is not because of land and resources. At this time, PRC spent a lot more resources on Tibet that ever getting back from it. The main reason was because China always believed that a legitimate administration should reunite China, but Tibet was regarded part of China since it was under Qing dynasty administration for 3 hundred years.

The overthrow of the monk ruling class was not first motivated by athiesm, but because the monks philosophy of slavery and serfdom run completely counter to the communist ideal of class equality.

Their power is restricted in a number of ways.  First, there is transparency.  You can find a list of every appropriations bill from each year quite easily, including which Representative or Senator proposed that particular appropriation.  This means that if Representative Smith appropriated $5 million to his cousin's company, it will be there for the world to see and he will likely lose his next election if he isn't kicked out of the House first.  

Second is that the pie is only so big, so there is competition among the members on the committee for slices of that pie.  The better that a appropriations request can be justified the better the chance it has of being included.  Of course, the most powerful members of the committee are easily able to get a few of the projects they want almost no matter what they are (within reason).

Third, the representatives do not themselves draw up appropriations requests.  The requests are submitted to a representative who then passes them on to the relevant subcommittee.  So an experimental farm that wants a research grant will write up a proposal and submit it to a representative that is on the House Appropriations Agricultural subcommittee.  He (actually his staff) will then pass it on to the actual subcommittee where it will be included with all the other requests that fall within the parameters of that subcommittee.  So a representative doesn't just get to say to themselves ""I'd like to give $5 million to Jones Experimental Farm"" - the farm itself draws up the proposal and submits it.  

Taking a step back its important at this point to say that the individual ""earmarks"" of the appropriations committee only account for about 2% of the final bill.  The rest is made up of the funding of various government agencies and the funding of the commitments of the US government, such as paying the interest on the national debt or paying the salaries of government employees.  So while the people on these committees are powerful, especially in comparison to other members of congress, they do not decide the budget for the entire US government.  


If you have further questions I'd be happy to answer.  I actually did an internship for a member of Congress on the House Appropriations Committee so I might be better positioned to answer your questions than some.  "	1	0

I think what I'm still confused on is what exactly is being appropriated. When you say earmarks only account for 2% of the final bill, what does that mean exactly? Do they only work on passing the yearly budget, or can they attach funding to any bill? And in general, what differentiates an earmark from funding that comes from some other source? And are they the people who decide on what to do with ""discretionary spending,"" or is that a different entity?"	2	0

That amount is different every year but, as I said above, its only about 2% of the final budget.  

For the next bit it will help you to be able to reference this pie chart:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._Federal_Spending_-_FY_2007.png

As you can see most of the money in the federal budget is already allocated before any politician ever gets near it.  Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the interest on the debt, and other mandatory spending account for 61% of the whole budget.  Of the remaining 39%, 20% is just for the Department of Defense, which leaves us with 19%.  That 19%, known as discretionary spending, is what the appropriations committees of the Senate and the House get to mess with.  But, and this is a huge but, the budget for every (non-defense) federal agency in the executive branch also gets taken out of that 19%.  So the Departments of Education, Agriculture, State, Energy, etc. etc. all must be taken from that 19%.  Those parts of the budget are proposed by the President and aside from some haggling, cutting, and shifting that goes on with the President's proposal it will largely be passed as is.  All that is now left is the 2% that I spoke of in my first post.  This 2% goes to fund individual projects known as ""earmarks"" which are what I was talking about in my first post.  This 2% is where most of the power of the appropriations committee comes from since it is still a large chunk of money.  

An earmark is just a word for money that has been appropriated for a specific project by a representative or senator.  The funding for earmarks comes out of the same pot that all the other government money comes from.

They cannot attach funding to any bill, the process we have been discussing is, most of the time, only applicable to the yearly budget.  There are, however, exceptions.  When there is a stimulus package there is the possibility that earmarks will be attached to that as well. Essentially Congress, and therefore the government, cannot spend money without it first being approved by both Appropriations Committees and then, of course, the whole Congress.  "	2	0

Every country has debt, but over time, investors realized that Greece was worse off than most other countries, and started demanding higher interest rates if they were to continue lending to them. As rates continue to rise, eventually they won't be able to borrow the money to keep paying their expenses. Left to their own devices, they would default on their debt, and people would pretty much stop lending to Greece.

However, Greece uses the Euro, and if they were to fall apart, the Euro would lose value, and the rest of Europe can't let that happen. The other countries in Europe got a bunch of money together and lent it to Greece at a lower rate than Greece could get on the market. However, they don't want Greece to default on that loan either, so they made sure that the Greek government took steps towards balancing their budget.

It wasn't really enough first time, so they had to do it again, and this time there was actually a ""controlled"" or ""partial"" default, where some banks were asked to voluntarily lower the rate at which they collect interest on their loans to the Greek government.

If they want to continue getting loans in the future, they will first pay the ""mortgage,"" that is, the stuff they owe to investors who have lent to Greece. They probably have enough money to do that. What happens though is that they will have no way to pay for a good chunk of the vast public services they provide. 

This means a lot of people who work for the government will lose their jobs, and a lot of people who get checks from the government for whatever reason (welfare, etc.) will suddenly have a lower income. Their GDP could shrink a staggering 10% practically overnight (that's the size of the budget deficit), and even if that doesn't happen in full, the shock waves from a smaller default could lead to a similar gdp shrinkage over then next months or years.

That definitely qualifies as economic collapse.

They could instead default on their debts, while continuing to pay for public services. However, much of their debt is owned by the Greek people, and they would all lose savings if that happened. They could try defaulting only on foreign-owned debt, and attempt to become self-sufficient. **This part is pure speculation**, but that would probably fail miserably. Balancing their budget is still difficult, and doing so would still hurt their economy. Their citizens would be wary to lend to a government that just defaulted, so it would be hard to borrow even from within. "	2	0

If you were to look at a scan of a processor die even a electronics hobbyist might easily identify likely areas that are ROM, caches, registers and components like the ALU (..add/sub) and the instruction/address decoder logic.

Explaining it to a 5 year old is probably going to be difficult, but, suffice it to say there are many simple components working together to do a larger task.. and it's really quite amazing and fun to learn about.

The x86 for example has separate address spaces for device I/O which could only be read/written to using special instructions IN and OUT, ISA devices like your sound card would be wired up to directly to pins on the processor, each pin representing a binary bit (0-1) and together forming an address, 20 addresses pins with either 8 (byte) or 16 (word) data pins.

These days thought most things use the primary address space, RAM, memory mapped devices or nothing.

The CPU just reads instructions from memory and after a long journey through the internal components it makes a decision, what that decision is implementation specific.

For a programmer, it is enough to have a slightly more than basic idea how this works.

The idea was that there were Jewish people just about everywhere, and Jewish people learn both the local language and Hebrew. So you show up, find a local Jewish guy, and you're all set. You talk to your guy in English, who translates to Hebrew, the Gelderlandian Jew translates from Hebrew to Gelderlandian, and your message gets across without anyone having to learn a new language.

So for the purposes of this analogy, you're writing a game in English but there are video cards from all sorts of different countries speaking all sorts of different languages. So you don't have to learn all of them, the API is Hebrew (and the video card driver is the guy who speaks both Hebrew and the local language).

When you write programs requiring 3d acceleration for computers, you have no idea what kind of video card the user will have. You could take forever learning to write it in nvidia-ish and ati-ese and whatever else there is and make it a whole complicated thing that wouldn't work if someone has a video card you didn't anticipate, but it's a whole lot easier to write it in DirectX and whoever uses your program will have DirectX drivers to translate it into the language of the video card they have.

(technically APIs cover a lot more ground than this... but the idea is that they're a set of instructions to allow you to interact with something else.

It isn't. They both send the same 'type' of information - digital data. What visible light offers (that radio-frequency doesn't) is basically this:

There's lots free spectrum to play with. You can think of the size of the spectrum as the diameter of a pipe: a larger pipe allows for more liquid to flow through it.  More spectrum = faster communications. Also, the radio-frequency spectrum is heavily, heavily, used already, so there's very little left.

Another thing is that the higher the frequency of your spectrum, the more information it can carry in a set amount of time. As visible light is of a higher frequency, you can use it to transmit data faster than an equivalent chunk of RF
spectrum. The trade off is that visible light doesn't penetrate solid objects, so it's no use if your light source is in the other room.

I'm not sure if that answers your question, but feel free to ask if there's anything else.

There always needs to be a point where we can produce more money - If there wasn't, you couldn't get a loan for a house or a car, deflation (where money becomes worth more relative to goods like bread and milk) occurs, which is bad for a number of reasons I can explain if you like. Some people think we shouldn't be able to ""print more money"", but that's really necessary for the economy to expand.

Having a ""debt reset"" is a terrible idea. Here's an example. Let's say your buddy comes to you and says ""Hey, I forgot my lunch money. Can I borrow $5 today? I'll pay you back $6 tomorrow"". You think this is a good idea - you can help your friend and you'll get an extra dollar out of it. Well, tomorrow comes around, and your buddy says ""Hey, there was a reset on the debt, so now I don't owe you any money"". Of course, you're mad, now not only did you not get an extra dollar but you are out five bucks! When the same buddy comes to you next week and says, ""Hey, I forgot my lunch again, can I have $5 to pay you back $6"", you're going to say ""I did that last week and you never paid me back! Of course you can't have $5!"". Well, now your buddy is going hungry, and you still can't buy ice cream because you lost your $5 last week."	3	0

That's where money *comes from.*

A lot of people misunderstand the concept of debt in a fundamental way. They've been scared into thinking debt is a monster hiding in the closet — and not unreasonably so, because compounding-interest unsecured personal debt can indeed be a very dangerous thing. But debt itself is not bad. In fact, it's necessary.

Consider your paycheck. You have a job; you get paid every week. Let's say that paycheck is one dollar, just to keep things simple. Where did that dollar come from?

Well, it came from your employer, obviously, whom we will call Alice. Alice has a payroll account at her bank, and when she paid you, your bank account was credited in the amount of one dollar, and her payroll account was debited in the amount of one dollar. That's where your dollar came from: Alice's bank account.

But where'd it come from before that? Clearly Alice can't just *wish* dollars into existence. They have to come from somewhere. Well, that dollar could have come from about a million places, depending on how Alice's business works. But let's say for sake of argument Alice's company makes widgets and sells them wholesale to retailers. So that dollar you got paid last week came from the sale of a batch of widgets to a retailer the week before — a retailer we'll call Bob.

So the dollar in your pocket came out of Alice's bank account, and it got into Alice's bank account by coming out of Bob's bank account. Where'd it come from them?

Bob — a retailer, remember — sold a gadget to Charlie, a private citizen. The dollar Bob paid Alice for that batch of widgets, which Alice ended up paying you with, came into Bob's hands when he sold that gadget to Charlie. And Charlie got that dollar from *his own* employer, Denise.

Now, Denise runs a different kind of business. Denise's business is high-priced durable goods … say, tractors. Denise got that dollar when she sold a tractor to Eleanor, but Eleanor didn't have the capital to buy that tractor herself. She had to *borrow it* from a bank, in the form of a secured loan. (Imagine this worked exactly like a car loan: Eleanor went to the bank and asked to borrow the money to buy the tractor; the bank agreed in exchange for interest — money on top of what Eleanor needed to borrow — and a lien on the tractor.)

So before you had the dollar, Alice had the dollar, and before Alice Bob had the dollar, and before Bob Charlie had the dollar, and before Charlie Denise had the dollar, and before Denise Eleanor had the dollar — but only briefly, because she got the dollar from the bank.

And where did the bank get the dollar? *The bank made it.* See, the bank Eleanor borrowed that dollar from (along with all the others she borrowed to pay for the tractor) works on a fractional reserve system. Meaning depositors put money into the bank, then the bank turns around and lends that money out again. This lending *creates money*. How? By backing it with some kind of an *asset*. In this case, the asset that backed the loan was Eleanor's *future labor.* In other words, Eleanor promised to work — using the tractor, presumably; maybe Eleanor is a farmer — and to exchange her work or the product thereof for money which she could use to pay back her loan. In other words, the person Eleanor was borrowing from was really *herself in the future*. If Eleanor had a tractor, and worked very hard every day for five years, she'd have the money to buy a tractor … so the bank just created the money she needed to buy the tractor *now* so she could buy it, work hard, then pay it off in the future.

So there are two salient points here: All money is backed by debt, and debt is the promise of future labor.

Where debt becomes iffy is when you start talking about risk. Because what if Eleanor had gotten hit by a bus the day after she signed for her loan? The bank would take a loss, is what would happen. The bank would get the tractor — because that was one of the terms of the loan — which it could then sell to recover *some* of the money it lent to Eleanor, but not all of it. The bank, therefore, needs to figure in the possibility of taking a loss every time it makes a loan. It does this by charging everybody who borrows a bit more than the bank is lending, with the idea being that if *most people* who borrow pay back their loans, the extra money the bank makes will cover the losses the bank takes on the few who don't.

Of course, we all see the potential problem there: What if, for reasons beyond the bank's control, only a *few* people pay back their loans and a *lot* of people don't? In that case, the bank has a serious problem on its hands. That's why we have systems in place to minimize the chance that that can happen — banks are strictly regulated in how they maintain their asset porfolios — and also systems to gracefully handle the situation if things go wrong anyway.

But sometimes even the most graceful collapse is still a collapse. When that happens, we all just have to dust ourselves off, take our losses and move on with life. That, too, is part of economics.

So *very, very long* (sorry) story made short, you can't ""reset"" debt, because money is debt. Every dollar that exists — euro, pound, yen, whatever — is backed by a debt that's worth at least one dollar. If you wipe out the debt, you wipe out the dollars."	11	0

At one point, money was shiny metal. Then it became a piece of paper you could redeem to get actual, shiny metal. Then it became debt in part because there wasn't enough shiny metal. See the progression: It went from physical object to symbolic object, which isn't that serious. Then it went to the promise of something later. Therein lies the problem - money doesn't have to be debt. Just set your Wayback machine for 1969.

However, there is a lot to be said for using some physical basis of money if for no other reason than to prevent the wholesale fabrication of money driving inflation. 

Specifically, as I understand it, there's a means by which a bank can borrow from the Federal Reserve at nearly-zero interest rates right now. But the Fed also pays interest on ""excess retention"" to encourage banks to keep reasonably-liquid capital available. Therefore, a bank can borrow at nearly zero percent, then get paid interest just for having the money.

Simplified, it looks like this:

BANK: ""I'd like to borrow eleventy quintillion dollars, please.""

FED: ""Of course! Here you go.""

BANK: ""I'd like to deposit eleventy quintillion dollars, please.""

FED: ""Of course! Good job.""

BANK: ""I'd like my interest payment on my eleventy quintillion dollars, please."" 

FED: ""Of course! Here you go!""


Obviously, I'm simplifying, but as financial transactions like that that do NOT represent a promise to do any real future work become increasingly commonplace, money no longer represents a unit of work a person could do or a unit of a commodity."	1	0

* User reports.  Youtube has a button that a viewer can click when they see a video that shouldn't be there.  If that button gets clicked, Youtube will have an employee check it out.  The more clicks it gets, the more likely they'll investigate right away.
* Automated filtering.  Youtube has software that compares uploaded videos to known lists of copyrighted material.  I don't think this is very effective against porn, though.
* Popular videos get checked.  If someone uploaded porn and it only got 10 or 20 views, that's not that big a deal to Youtube.  But any video that gets hundreds of thousands or millions of views is probably checked out by an employee even if it isn't reported, because Youtube wants to know what's popular and knows that sometimes things are popular *because* they shouldn't be there, like porn."	3	0

By knowing what is popular, what kinds of people like what things, etc. etc., they can make smarter decisions about marketing.

For example, imagine Z-Corp makes some product, X, and has a facebook page for X, which some facebook users like.  Z-Corp might look at the data on who liked the page for X and see that 75% were woman and 25% were men. Additionally, Z-Corp might find out that 50% of those that liked it were age 18 to 30, 20% were 30 to 50, 20% under 18, and 10% over 50.

Based on that info, Z-Corp may decide to change its ads for X to target women aged 18 to 30, since those are the people they now think are most likely to buy their products.  Lots of research has been done on how to advertise to specific age groups and genders, so Z-Corp will probably increase their sales thanks to smarter advertising."	7	0

It also encourages investment; if you have $1 million, you need to use your money to get some sort of return or it will become less valuable over time.

Deflation is the opposite - money tomorrow is worth more than money today.  So there's no reason not to keep your money under your matress.  No one will borrow money, because they'll have to pay back money that's worth more than what they borrowed.  The result is that no one spends any money.  And because no one is spending any money, money becomes even more valuable.  Which means that now NO ONE wants to spend any money.

First lets talk about photons. These packets of light hit an atom and give their energy to the electron cruisin along around the outside of the atom. This extra energy makes it jump out farther but it wants to balance back out so it sheds that energy as another photon. If that packet hits your eye, you will see it. One photon is to small to notice so lots of photons have to bounce to make data. As things get smaller it becomes harder to bounce enough photons off them to get data. So we use lenses to collect up as many of these photons as we can and make a narrow beam to get them to our eyes. Think about a magnifying glass focusing light to a point. When things get even smaller even this focused beam doesn't help. Then we scan them with other methods like beams of electrons.	3	0

The argument is that when you look at a piece of wax, your 5 senses tell you that it has a specific shape, texture, color, smell, etc. Then, when you hold that piece of wax to a fire, you find something with completely different shape, texture, color, smell, etc. And yet, somehow you know that this ""new"" thing is actually the same thing as the wax you had before. Therefore, you must be using something other than your 5 senses to decide that it is the same thing."	6	0

Without them, a battlefield would be just a bunch of people running around killing each other, which is rather confusing. With a flag-bearer, the different sides could identify roughly where the friends and foes are, and where to go after the battle.

It's not really a global law that countries have to have flags. It's not a law that they have to have names either, or that companies must have logos. It's just common practice, but it does provide a symbol for the unity of a nation, and in this sense it's a useful tool of power.

As far as your other question goes, *every* picture, including flags, are combinations of colors.

If you're asking why flags aren't pictures *of* something, most of them used to be, and these symbols survive until today in the form of coats of arms, and can be complicated indeed. I guess most countries recognised the need for a simpler symbol, but many countries use complicated pictures in their flags today, too."	4	0

Scotland had white and blue and England had White and Red. This is the tribal paint he's talking about. Progressing onto later dates, in the ages of battles being fought with muskets the soldiers would wear a uniform of a particular color. Up until the modern wars the English army wore red.

Most modern flags are associations with those national colors. Some, like Wales (A dragon on green and white background) show some more national identity.

Modern flags take the color the country identifies with most, some even add details to distinguish them. 

So yes, flag colors have their roots in tribal war paint, then colors used on battlefields, then national identity. Its become such a trend to have simple identifiable colors that most every country has a simple flag.
.

EDIT: Complex symbols were difficult to replicate and spread across countries before modern communications and transportation so simpler designations were used. You will find complex patterns in coats of arms, but those weren't circulated nationally.

Again, the trend for simple designs is half fashion, half due to old fashioned practicality.

That said, there are some pretty unusual flags out there. Libya during the Gaddafi regime had a flag that was just solid green with no other colors or decorations. The flag of Nepal is shaped like two overlapping triangles; it's one of the few flags that is not a rectangle. The flag of Switzerland is square, which is also pretty unusual.

(Because even a random mashing of a few notes in the pentatonic scale is going to sound *somewhat* pleasant.)

That gives us 5^8, or 390,625 combinations.

Now that's not considering the difference harmony makes to a melody. Play it once with Cmaj-Gmaj chords, and again with Amin-Emin, you could almost pass both of them each off as distinct melodies.

(You couldn't do this for the melody of a whole song, but for an eight-note snippet? Sure, I'd go for that.)

But how could you calculate the full range of harmonic possibilities? I've written songs with chord sequences that I've never heard elsewhere (that's not ""I'm so clever I found new ones"", it's just par for the course given how broad the options are.) It'd be fun to toss out an estimate but frankly I couldn't even try! A factor of two? Ten? A hundred?

Hrm. Fuck it, let's deliberately harshly underestimate and just say 3 - major, minor, jazz chords - and move on to consider tempo. Sure, if you play a melody *andante* as opposed to *adagio* it's going to sound the same. But what about played at twice the speed? Or half the speed? More options. That triples options doesn't it? And what if you play some parts of it fast and other parts slow?

In other words, let's introduce rhythm. Play your first two notes as crotchets, your next two as a dotted quaver + semi-quaver pair, the next three as a triplet...the full range of possibilities here is ENORMOUS. Frankly mond-bogglingly *huge*. Even if all we did was change two notes into a (dotted quaver + semi-quaver) among six crotchets, that increases your base melodies seven-fold. Loosen the restriction that they appear side by side and your number increases 56 times over.

And this is if only TWO of your eight beats change to ONE rhythmic alternative out of dozens.

Actually, shit, let's try and do this. Eight notes. Each of them could possibly be any one of (let's keep it simple and say) [six](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note_value) lengths. Let's put a number on this holy christ it's gonna be big.

Eight notes, each having five melodic possibilities and six rhythmic possibilities, the totality having three harmonic  and three tempo...onic possibilities.

So that's 3 x 3 x 5^8 x 6^8?

1,968,300,000,000 possible melodies.

That's. Fucking. Huge.

And that's with a super-lowball guess for the effect of harmony. That's just one voice (oh we didn't even go there!). That's only the pentatonic scale. And that's only eight notes long."	3	0

This is not to say that there are no people who embrace their native culture and heritage, but that a person's religion, name, and language do not determine their ancestry.

There is plenty of history of interbreeding between the Spanish and the natives.

That's not the base for Fahrenheit, that's just what it converts to.  And it only converts precisely to these values because it was adjusted to be that way.  

The actual base for Fahrenheit is 0°F for the freezing point of brine (a mixture of water and ammonium chloride in equal parts) and 96°F for an approximation of the body temperature of a human (or a horse, according to some sources).  It was 96 and not 100 because it was initially 12 steps (like 12 inches in a foot) and each of them was subsequently divided in 8 parts (like inches are divided in 8ths).  Why not make 10 steps and divide them in 10 parts?  Because fuck you, that's why.

Orginally, the freezing and boiling points of water were *about* 32°F and 212°F.  It was later decided to adjust the Fahrenheit scale so that these values were *precisely* 32°F and 212°F.  This explains why body temperature is not 96°F anymore.

&gt; Here, 32 is the difference between when salt water and fresh water freezes. (Salt water freezes at 0.)

Not quite: as explained above, it's the freezing point of a very specific kind of salt water: water and ammonium chloride in equal parts.  But the freezing point of salt water varies with the kind of salt and its proportion to water.  Sea water is the most common form of salt water in the world, and it freezes at about 28°F.

Ask if you don't. But I'm going to explain the idea of a vector again because I want to make sure we have the same concept in mind of what a vector is.

A *vector* is something with size and direction, as opposed to a *scalar*, which has only a size (though scalars can have a sign, as long as it doesn't represent direction). For example, temperature is a scalar - the temperature is 300 K, not 300 K in the eastward direction. Velocity is a vector - the car moves at 30 mph in the eastward direction. (The size of the velocity vector, in this case 30 mph, is called speed.)

Now, it's easy to talk about size, because size is a scalar. But direction is a little messier - what do you call the direction towards the middle star of Orion's belt, for example? So what I'm going to do is set up some coordinates - my axes will be the north-south axis, the east-west axis, and the up-down axis from my current position. And I'm going to create a vector of length 1 (a ""unit vector"") in the direction that I'm talking about.

Now, in my current coordinates, some directions are really easy to work with. East, for example, is along an axis. So I'm going to call a unit vector that points east i. Likewise for north - that's j. And up - that's k.

So what if I want to talk about the direction ""northeast"" in terms of my coordinates? Well, it's equal parts north and equal parts east - this means that i + j points northeast. But if you do Pythagoras, the vector i + j has length sqrt(2). So to get a unit vector pointing northeast, I need to multiply i+j by 1/sqrt(2). So the unit vector pointing northeast is (i+j)/sqrt(2).

Now what about the direction towards the middle star in Orion's belt? Well, that points a combination of up, (we'll say, I don't know offhand) north, and east. But what combination? Well, our star has some coordinates in our coordinate system - we'll say that it's 1 unit east, 2 units north, and 3 units up in whatever units are appropriate. So that direction is written as i (1 east) + 2j (2 north) + 3k (3 up). And you can check that if you add the vectors i, 2j, and 3k using a picture, you'll get a vector which, if you put its tail at the origin, will have its head at (1,2,3). Now I can divide our vector out by its length (sqrt(14) by the distance formula) to get a unit vector pointing towards the middle star of Orion's belt.

The handy part is that if you have two vectors (of any length) expressed this way, say i+j+k and 2i+3j+4k, I can add the is, js, and ks separately to get a nice way to express the sum vector, that is, 3i+4j+5k. Single-variable calculus also works on each term separately.

As for matrices, it turns out that if you write your vector as a matrix [(i-component), (j-component), (k-component)]^T (T for transpose, the matrix I want is a 3 by 1 matrix which is hard to type here), vector sums and scalar multiplication work the same as matrix sums and multiplication of a matrix by a scalar. Also, the dot product of two vectors a and b, in their matrix forms, is given by a^T b.

There's also a shortcut for cross product a x b using matrices - if you make the ""matrix"" whose rows are (i, j, k), a^T , and b^T , then the determinant of that matrix gives you the cross product. This is only a symbolic shortcut though - you can't actually put vectors (i, j, k) and components of vectors (the entries of a^T and b^T ) in the same actual matrix."	3	0

It's a thought experiment; an idea. It was proposed by Erwin Schrodinger, and it involves a cat and a box. Inside this box is a hammer, the cat, a vial of poison, a geiger counter, and radioactive material. The box is rigged up so that if the material decays (which is completely random), the geiger counter detects it, makes the hammer swing and break the poison, and the cat dies.

If you shut the box, there are no observers. No one knows what's going to happen in the box, and in fact, can't know. It's completely random, so until you open the box, you have no idea if the cat is alive or dead. The thought experiment proposes that, until you do, the cat is both alive and dead at the same time.

Schrodinger ~~won a Nobel Prize for this thought experiment because it~~ showed how some quantum mechanical processes don't make sense on a macro (real world) scale, and by extension, don't make sense on a micro scale. He was flawed, but the first part still holds up. Obviously a cat can't be alive and dead at the same time. But with quantum physics, until you observe certain particles which can be in one of two states, it's actually in both, in much the same way as the cat is alive and dead.

The joke, in case you didn't understand fully, was that until the next part of the song kicks in, you don't know which one it is. So it's both Under Pressure and Ice Ice Baby at the same time.

He set up the experiment: 
1. there is radioactive material, a geiger counter, a hammer, hydrocyanic poison, and a cat in a box. 
2. The hammer is set up to drop if the geiger counter detects a single particle of radioactive decay. If the hammer drops, then it breaks the vial of hydrocyanic poison and kills the cat. 
3. It only takes one radioactive particle to decay and kill the cat, so until it is observed, as the copenhagen interpretation suggests, the radioactive particle is both decayed and not decayed. 
4. This means that the cat in the box is both alive and dead.

Anyway, we never see this in the real-world. Objects are in one place and one place only. The cat is EITHER alive OR dead. Not both, and not neither. This is where people often misinterpret the experiment. From what we know, cats are never in a superposition.

Schrodinger's cat is a way of pointing out a facet of quantum mechanics we don't understand yet. An unstable isotope is actually both decayed and undecayed until we observe it. But the question is, why doesn't that carry over to the cat? Is the cat too big? Does the cat's presence count as observing? Some other explanation?

Schrodinger came up with this thought experiment as an argument against the superposition of quantum states (which says that a particle can act like its multiple places at once, until it is forced to  decide exactly where it is when it interacts with something). Schrodinger's cat wasn't supposed to just show that superposition doesn't make sense on a macro scale, he was saying that by extension it didn't make sense on a micro scale. His argument was flawed, and he eventually admitted it.

&gt;His Nobel was for advances in wave mechanics in general. He helped us understand that all particles also act likes waves, and he came up with some really useful equations to help us understand how these waves behave. "	10	0

Experiments like the double-slit show this to be true; the two states interfere with each other, so the system behaves in a way different than it would if it were in one or the other state by itself.	5	0

You are familiar with the set up right? A particle that is in a superposition of states (say yes and no) is hoked up to a detector that is hooked up to some sort of contraption that will kill the cat when when a particle is in a certain state. Well, the argument goes that sense the particle that governs the whole system is in a superposition of states of all possibilities (both yes and no at the same time) then so is the whole system, including the cat. 

This argument complacently misses the fact it isn't *observation* that causes the collapse  of a superposition (the collapse of the superposition of states is a fancy way of saying forcing the particle to choose either yes or no) it is any interaction period. Because the particle has to interact with the detector, this simple act will cause the collapse of the superposition. That's what Schrodinger got wrong.

The idea of particles existing in a cloud of states and acting like a wave are indeed the same idea. The ""wave"" that we are referring to is the particles chance of being in any certain place, at any given time. It is a wave of possibilities of where the particle might be, and as the double slit experiment you mentioned showed us, the particle is actually in all the possible places it can be untill it is forced to decide exactly where it is.

I can tell you have a decent background in physics, sorry if I came off as condescending. The simplicity was for the benefit of everyone else. "	7	0

Nitpicky here, but that part's not true. Schrodinger won the nobel prize for his contributions to quantum mechanics, along with Paul Dirac. He came up with the thought experiment two years later.

That’s what my hapless heroine asked when confronted with that phrase. It all has to do with quantum physics, believe it or not.

    “Oh, I thought you meant cat, like pussy cat,” Chorie said.
    “I do mean a pussy cat.”
    “Quantum physics has pussy cats?”


Yes, quantum physics has a cat. A cat trapped in a box. A cat that is neither dead nor alive. It all started like this:

The tiny building blocks that make up matter, like electrons and photons, have dual personalities. Scientists can do experiments that prove these quanta are not particles but wave functions. Unfortunately for those of us who are rational, they also can do experiments that prove they are not wave functions but particles. Quantum physicists learned to live with the ambiguity and declared that it was the observation of these entities that determined which face they showed to the world.

Along about that time, Schrödinger said something like, “Wait a minute, guys. That makes no sense at all. Suppose you put a cat in a box and then you shoot an electron at it. Suppose the box is rigged to kill the cat if the electron turns out to be a particle and not kill it if it is a wave function. What happens to the cat until an observer takes a peak to see which face the electron showed us?”

Everyone went something like, “Oh, yeah. You’re right. There must be something wrong with our math. With our experiments. With our equations.”

Then along came Everett. And he said, “Wait a minute, guys. Your theory is correct because everything that can possibly happen does happen. Each possibility splits off into a new dimension. Schrödinger’s electron is both a particle and a wave function. The cat both lives and dies. The observer sees the cat both dead and alive. This is my Many Worlds Theory and it gets rid of Schrödinger’s troublesome cat and lets you keep your math and science and ambiguity. For in one world the electron is a particle and the observer finds the cat dead. In another world, the electron is a wave function and the observer sees the cat alive.”

Or something like that.

In fact, there's no need to think ""collapse"" is something that really happens out there in the world. To demonstrate this all you have to do is imagine how things would look different if the wavefunction never collapsed, but just continued to evolve. Answer: they wouldn't look different at all, because the particles that make up our brains would be entangled with whatever we observe and so we would still only see one outcome."	1	0

It's not like Christmas morning when you wake up and don't know what your parents bought you. It's actually a lot more complex than that. The idea is that there is no outside action other than nature (whether the radioactive material decays or not) and because of that, nature cannot make a decision since there is no outside force to dictate the decision (meaning you visibly seeing the cat dead or alive). So nature doesn't decide, it just leaves the cat in a superposition state, where it both is alive and not alive (this gets even worst in particle physics, because you have the uncertainty principle, wave functions, and a bunch of other crap, that could say that the cat is alive, dead, on Jupiter, non-existent, outside of the box, or inside another box all at the same time, until you collapse the wave function) until a force (you observing it) forces it to choice. The idea gets even more complicated, because what force is making us decide to open the box at all? Are we ever in a superposition state where we decide to open the box and not open the box at the same time, and an outside collapses the wave function and we open the box? And if so, what dictates that force? But of course we are macro and so we don't have the same rules as quantum (or at least we believe that to be). But if you ask a string theorist we do, and those superposition states we encounter are then acted out inversely on another universe (meaning in our universe we open the box, in another universe we don't) and nature does this for all of the superposition opportunities (cat lives in one, dies in another, and all the other examples I said early there is an universe for each, in fact there is an infinite number of states it can be in, an infinite universe for it).	1	0

Its suppose to explain quantum physic, world of very very small. Particles are in both completely opposite states and it will take one state by the simple act of observing. Problem with this theory is that you cant observe these small particles without reacting with them. You need special instrument to see them and when you bring that instrument it reacts with particles with its mass, magnetism, electricity... but some people think it reacted by simple watching the particle.

To understand better lets say there is a pile of gunpowder in completely dark room. It is so dark you cant see anything. What you need is the source of light. Lets say the only source of light in the world is open flame. You bring the open flame closer to the gunpowder to see it and it explodes.

It's because people interpret scientific statements in everyday language instead of what the scientists are actually trying to say.

Just so you know what I'm talking about the scientific definition of a theory is ""a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment."" But in every day usage theory just means ""some idea I had."" So when people hear about a scientific theory they think it means any old idea to explain something, when it actually means a really good explanation that's backed up by a lot of evidence.


So when scientists say a superposition state collapses when it's observed they do not mean this only happens when someone looks at it and tries to measure it. It has nothing to do with us knowing if it's there or not. The electron don't give a damn if a scientist is trying to look at it and it doesn't get camera shy. In simple terms the superposition state will collapse when anything from the outside interacts with it. Anything at all.

We just say that it collapses when its observed because to do any kind of observation we need to interact with it, which will cause it to collapse. So if we want to do an experiment involving superposition state electrons it means that for as long as we want the superposition to exist we cannot allow anything to interact with it, which means we cannot make any observations. We can't look at it! For as long as we want the superposition to exist we have to make sure never to measure it because measuring it requires interacting with it and interacting with it will collapse it.

By designing a wing-like system and positioning it at the right angle, you can establish lift, like you would use for an aircraft. The air pressure above the wing is lower than the pressure below it, thus you get flight. In the case of a race car, you can use it in an opposite manner by positioning the tail fin at an angle that creates higher pressure above the fin than below, thus keeping the car on the road and more stabilized. That's it in a nutshell. 	1	0

So, if you make an object that is shaped in a way that air moves over the top of it very fast, and underneath it very slowly, that object will get sucked upwards into the vacuum created by the lower pressure air above it.

Rather than the fairly obvious conclusion - that the majority of voters will usually vote against policies that directly attack their interests - they choose to conclude that we in fact have *not* been able to have elections without voter ID laws. They argue instead that many elections (the ones they do not win) have been failed elections, in which the wrong candidate (i.e., not theirs) has won because of endemic voter fraud.

Voter's fraud doesnt really happen because the average person doesnt want to get rid of their vote. Most people hold it to be virtuous, and rightly so in a democratic society.
Voters IDs are a barrier in voting. It requires people to get ids which often costs money, or are a hassle to get through to get yours. This causes some people to be indifferent and just not get an id, or not get one in time to vote. The restrictions of time from registering to vote also work to delay time between voting cycles.
Let's talk about money ids. Firstly, man people view it as a poll tax. This is relevant because people who are hurt most by this are the poor, especially those in poverty. Typically, minorities and students are the ones in these financial situations. And if it's between voting and gas to get to work, you pretty much have to choose gas.
So, we have to look at why. Well, minorities and college students tend to vote for candidates that seek to improve their living conditions and quality of life. Parties that feel government subsidies and forms of social welfare tend to not want these individuals to vote. Regardless, voter ids are typically only used by individual sects within a party, not the party at large.
So, why bar these two groups? Most people dont vote. It's an unfortunate fact. But a large percent of these groups do. College students tend to become politically active at this stage in life, and others seek to preserve their quality of life, but also increase their social opportunities. Due to various facts of racism, discrimination, cultural differences, etc., opportunities tend to be harder to obtain, and since money can enable for opportunity, the poor are seeing a lack of their social opportunity and mobility. 
So with these groups voting in large groups, they can sway elections very easily. And some corrupt politicians seek to block their votes to increase their odds of their policies being passed, them being re-elected, etc."	1	0

Food is a really simple example. A grocery store gets a load of bananas. They go out on the shelf. They have a limited time where they have to be sold or else they spoil and need to be thrown out. As the sell-by date gets closer, you'll see stores try to sell it harder. Sales are really common. Sometimes things get sold for less than they were paid for if they need to. Getting a bit of money is better than nothing for bananas that get thrown out.

Clothing does a similar thing. You usually see big sales for clothing towards the end of a season. Even though sandals don't go bad like bananas do, they risk going out of style or out of season. Nobody's buying sandals in February. If you're a premium brand, it might make sense to destroy stuff rather than devalue it though.

The goal though is to only buy what you can sell. Holding on to inventory has a cost too because it takes up space that could be used for other things. You also need to have enough on hand that you actually have something to sell. It's really hard to get that balance just right."	1	0

Tons of clothing ends up at community non profit stores.  If you volunteer time to work in their clothing organization/separation areas, it's surprising just how much new, good clothing comes in.  It's part of the reason these non profit stores don't want clothes with holes in them, they already have enough new and good quality used clothes to cover their needs.

This must be managed very carefully, however, as it is very easy to screw up and not make/buy enough, which will result in an unhappy customer.

This will also vary from company to company as well.  My company, for example, tries to only buy what we can sell, which is great when you have skilled product planners who know what they are doing but can easily go south.  Other companies operate under the philosophy that they would rather have too much of something than not enough, but this does create additional risk if they are unable to sell the product quickly enough.

It is really a very delicate balance, and a skilled planner can be worth his or her weight in gold.

GST was introduced in 2000 by then prime minister John Howard which replaced the Wholesale sales tax. This tax was literally randomly assigned to products and was either 11%, 22% or 33%. For example, chocolate milk might have an 11% tax whereas full cream milk might have a 22% tax (just as an example; not actually true).   
   
The GST replaced this stupid tax and is a flat 10% on almost every single good and service in Australia. The only goods this does not apply to is fresh produce such as fruit and vegetables.   
   
The advantage of the GST is that it is unavoidable. Unlike income tax which can be evaded, there is no way for a consumer to evade GST because every time you buy something, it is already included in the price.   
   
All revenue from the GST is redistributed to the state governments and is spent on things such as health and education."	4	0

Well, the GST isn't directly good for consumers because it adds 10% to the price (obviously) but part of the introduction of the GST was aligned with purposeful reductions in income tax. So, instead of paying tax when you earn, you payed it when you spent. Also, the fact that it would be redistributed to state governments helped."	2	0

So, for instance, bread is exempted, but biscuits are not.  There was actually a multilmillion dollar high court lawsuit about whether or not breadsticks are bread or biscuit.

Also, almost all the GST is redistributed to the state government, but not quite all of it. It's also not redistributed at the same rate that it's collected. NSW and Victoria, for instance, get back about 90 cents to the dollar of GST revenue they collect.

GST is avoidable too, but mainly in the sense of a cash economy (e.g. a tradesman offers you a discount to pay in cash, because it means they wouldn't have to pay the GST on it because there'd be no receipt, and so they don't have to charge as much), which is an avoidance that is shared to some extent by income tax."	3	0

Where it can hurt corporations is because the cost of collecting the GST on a foreign purchase (e.g. buying online from an overseas shop) if the purchase is over $950 or so, so any purchases under $1000 bought online are GST free.

Because of that, lots of Australian retailers are struggling because their customers come into the shop, look at the goods, then go and order them online for cheap.

In Canada, the GST/HST is added at the to the sticker price at checkout when you buy something.  So, when you see a sticker price in a shop for $10, you have to remember that you'll have to pay 15% on top of that when you hand over your money.

The company is ultimately the who collects the money, and holds it until its time to pay.

In my company in the UK, every quarter we file a VAT return and pay our bill.  Our bill is the money we've collected in VAT, minus the VAT we've paid to our own suppliers.  So, in the chain of transactions, the tax is only on end use or end sale if that makes sense.

Not sure about deflation... I was a child when GST was brought in in Canada. 

However, a recent increase in VAT to 20% from 17.5% here in the UK caused some interesting questions for businesses.  If you sell something for £10 sticker, do you increase your sticker price, or eat the margin decrease..."	2	0

&gt;What exactly does he know that helps the president craft his plan?

He would likely have lots of background as to what policies have worked in what countries.  A comprehensive knowledge of the consequences of said policies, what might work with the current political climate, what wouldn't, what to stay away from, etc.  And not things like, ""we should tax 'cadillac' health care policies to pay for subsidies.""  A wonk is going to say, ""OK, so a tax of 10% on policies providing over $10k per year in benefits is going to raise $X and from Y% of the population, while a 12% increase on policies over $12k per year is going to raise $P from Q% of the population.""

Just to supplement what you said... They're the people who actually do the maths and the details behind the scenes. The people who evaluate the options, as you said the actual concrete policy, who are able and willing to answer questions and produce data for analyzation. Who are capable of actually figuring out what examples like you said - they produce things that laypeople rely on as being true.

For example, [here](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/29/internal-devaluation-inflation-and-the-euro-wonkish/) is a Paul Krugman article he put a tag on as wonkish. And, just to complement that, [here](http://andolfatto.blogspot.com/2011/12/does-krugman-understand-ricardian.html) is a self-styled wonkish blog post criticizing Krugman. But keep in mind that these are ""wonkish"". They require some knowledge to understand, they aren't for general consumption, but they aren't entirely representative of the work that actual PHD's do.

You can quite literally see them coming across the ocean, since they usually start as storm systems off the western coast of Africa.  They get stronger by absorbing the warm, moist air over the ocean - this property is what classifies them as tropical storm systems in the first place.  Whether or not they form into tropical storms and hurricanes depends heavily on environmental factors, but they're extremely easy to see coming once they get started.

A hurricane's categorization is based purely on the maximum sustained wind speed, not any other factors such as size, rainfall, or how fast the storm is moving.  A storm becomes a tropical storm and gets a name when the wind speed hits 35 MPH.  Category 1 hurricanes have wind speeds of 64 MPH.  The scale goes up to category 5 at 175 MPH.

However, the biggest danger posed by a hurricane isn't the wind speed - it's the storm surge.  Storm surge is when the wind literally pushes the ocean inland, usually with great force.  To put it in perspective, the deadliest natural disaster to hit the US according to Wikipedia is the storm surge caused by a 1900 hurricane that hit Galveston, TX and killed between 6000 and 12000 people.

Sandy in particular caused a lot of damage despite being ""only"" a category 1 due to several factors.  It hit an absolutely massive area over an extended period of time after merging with several other storms in a location that's not used to getting hit with hurricanes.  Contrast against Florida, for example, which gets hit by hurricanes on a regular basis, so the residents are used to them and know how to prepare.

Many councils, states, etc. often provide their own realtime data which is then aggregated by either the map provider or a third party. It's often estimated too, by interpolating the traffic at one location and another, and the average use of the road(s) in between. Thus, you'll find that it's not every road, but most. As for how measurements are taken actually at the roads, this has become automated in many cases by traffic cameras (which are far more numerous than you might realise), as opposed to someone specifically choosing 'this road is very busy'.	2	0

Google combines information from these two things, and uses things like history information like ""average traffic on this street at this time of day"", to report back to you, just what traffic looks like with a pretty high degree of accuracy!

As an example, war is a direct competion between two nations. It has been shown to drive the economy, increase technological development and innovation, and has the obvious advantage of controlling resources that you win. The downside is that resources are used for destroying instead of building, resources and infrastructure are destroyed, and lives are lost. 

Cooperation allows both groups to combine their resources, with both groups gaining. Trade, peace, and all those advantages naturally follow. Resources are spent on infrastructure and used to benefit the population directly. The disadvantages are that resources must be shared, the other group's wishes must be considered, and there is no urgent pressure to innovate.

In your example the electricity goes into the bulb and becomes heat, which produces light. But not all of that electricity is light, most of it is becoming heat and the light is actually a byproduct. So all the heat is lost and wont power the solar power and thus the machine cant run itself forever as it will be losing electricity.

The reason is that solar panels and light bulbs aren't 100% efficient. At best solar panels about 25% efficient in converting light into electricity. Incandescent bulbs only convert about 10% of their electricity into light and the rest is converted into heat. Fluorescent and LED bulbs are better, but still not close to 100% efficient in creating light.

So, this system would very quickly lose energy as waste heat and would fail after a few seconds.

In a perfect world, for a given amount of energy you get specific amount of light, and for given amount of light, you get specific amount of energy. For lightbulb to work, it needs to lose some of its light to illuminate the room, which means that not all of it will reach the panel, which means that some energy will be lost.	2	0

These restrictions were first imposed in the 60s, when a PED probably meant a passenger's transistor radio, which were apparently potent sources of EMI even though they were meant to be just receivers. You can't expect cabin crews to make judgement calls on the quality of electrical engineering, so lifting the ban doesn't just require that the plane be immune form your Nexus 7, but also from your great grandma's vintage '72 pocketable B/W CRT television and your uncle's tube-based shortwave receiver."	3	0

When they're hit by a neutron in just the right way, the nucleus of the atom splits into pieces, releasing a lot of energy.  Not only that, this split releases more neutrons.  Those neutrons then can run into other atoms of Uranium-235, causing more splits, and so on, and so on.  This is called a chain reaction.  Enormous amounts of energy are released.	3	0

The WTO is an organization set up to govern international trade, where if you are a memeber of the WTO you have to extend most favored nations status to everyone else in the group. In other words, each country has to treat each other country equally when it comes to trade barriers like tariffs.  It is also the WTO's goal to reduce trade barriers across the globe. 

The World Bank is much like it sounds, a bank designed to serve the world. Typically the bank makes loans for economic development projects, like a dam in India. Interest is charged on these loans, and they are hopefully paid back, but the interest is such that the government undertaking said development can pay them back.

The IMF is designed to help facilitiate resolutions to balance of payment's problems that often arise. Your national trade account is said to balance when your exports match your imports, but in some situations economies can get out of whack and they have to import much more than they export. They cannot stop importing some goods out of necessity, and need help which is where the IMF steps in and provides short term loans that have stringent conditions associated with them. 

All three agencies are often shot at by anti imperialist people. It could be said that the WTO exploits labors in foreign countries, the World Bank just builds large projects that ruin indigenous lands and the IMF is a bunch of blood sucking scum who's loan terms are outrageous. "	5	0

Also, with perspective and depth come issues of positioning. When we see something that's further away from another thing, we can't end up drawing ""further away."" It turns out, when you flatten it, it's next to or above or below. Similarly, if you have a table that's four feet deep, the line that you have to draw might be just a few centimeters. This is totally counterintuitive and it takes a bit of forced thinking to overcome.

Compared to the perspective business, the motor skills of simply drawing a thing are a piece of cake.

There are often coups or power-grabs or even civil wars. In the U.S., the transition of power has always been peaceful (with the partial exception of Lincoln), and we really would like to keep it that way.

People in positions of power often find ways to hold onto that power (like forging relationships, crafting laws that favor them in subtle ways, or even just relying on the inertia of voters). This is why senators are and governors frequently keep their jobs until they retire or seek an even higher office. But as the public face of the country, the president's role is unique. Without a tradition or rule that limits presidents, it would probably be normal for presidents to remain in power for decades, often ending mid-term with the president's death or incapacity. This would make power transfers less common, more jarring, and more risky. By having a specific law (and before that, an honored tradition) of a 2-term limitation, everyone knows that a president can only do good or harm for eight years.

The answer, however, is a bit more complicated. As is mentioned, the president is supposed to be the public figure of the country, but he or she is not meant to be the symbol of the country in the way that the king and queen are the symbol of England. The President of the US is meant to represent the people, not as a ruler but as a communicator of the people's will. This then bridges into the aforementioned problems of peaceful transition and ensuring accurate representation of the current will of the people. Incumbents (politicians or presents looking for reelection, as opposed to a challenger) also historically had and advantage winning elections, and people are often more willing to reelect and acceptable president than bet on the new challenger. 

The argument for or against this policy (22nd amendment) is a bit more complex, but between all of the pieces, the gist is there.

Most presidents following him usually chose not to run for third terms, their time was over. This changed with the presidency of FDR. He was elected to 4 terms. Following his four terms Congress decided to pass an amendment (the 22nd) that restricted the maximum number of terms a president could serve, which is two. 

The main motivation behind the amendment is that presidents, unlike royalty, need to be constantly changing to reflect the will of the people. This helps keep with peaceful transitions of power, and ensures that the people's voice is ultimately in power. 

There are some arguments against the amendment like ""the president can do whatever he/she wants in their second term because they don't have to worry about re-election."" But I think this is ludicrous, if we were worried about the president ""doing whatever they wanted,"" why would we have elected them in the first place? or twice for that matter?

The bottom line is that the office of the president always needs some fresh blood. George Washington recognized this and after FDR's election to four terms it was realized that we might want to put it in the constitution before someone decided they were a lot better than Washington and wasn't as nice as FDR."	7	0

While they did live quite a few years more, I'm sure none of them were particularly thrilled with the idea of being president into their 70s--Remember they had already passed the life expectancy for the 1700s to early 1800s. Jackson(7) was 70 when his presidency ended.

Lincoln(16) was shot, and thus could not run for president.
There wasn't another 2-term president that could have run for a third, until Grant(18) after the civil war. Grant most likely would have been a elected a third time. It was far enough past the 'Founding Fathers' era, and Grant was a war hero. However, scandals ruled his presidency and ruined any chance of him getting a third nomination.

The next president to win a second term was William McKinley(25) and he was assassinated as well.

After McKinley, we have Woodrow Wilson(28) who was in poor health and unpopular at the end of his second term. He died 3 years after leaving office.

Next is FDR, who won 4 terms. 

In total we have 8 presidents (Not counting those like Teddy who took over for an assassinated president, but if we do, there are I believe 11). Of which, the vast majority were in no position to run for a third due to health or age, and those that could have, screwed it up. 

I'd say the 'Washington only had 2 terms"" may have influenced Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe. Perhaps even Jackson. However, after that, I think it's more an urban legend.

The reason we have Congress is to specifically prevent this. The President can ask for legislation and set certain policies during his second term, but he really can't do much to change things without the approval of Congress. What limited changes he can make are only for the term of his Presidency; if the next President chooses to, he can change them the same way.

The whole point of the system is to keep any one person from being able to gain enough power to unilaterally run the government. By forcing the President out of office after his second term you ensure that there's no way for him to establish continuity of power.

Beyond that, if there's a perception that the incoming president is only there as a placeholder until the outgoing president is eligible for reelection again it effectively kills the interim president's credibility. For example, look at Medvedev in Russia. From day one it was kind of assumed that he was there has Putin's handpicked guy so that Putin could still run things behind the scene until he was eligible to run for president again.

This means certain mathematical principles apply to this set which are very convenient for calculations.  The larger the size of a set is, the more versatile the code can be, meaning more types of messages can be sent.  For example, look at the alphabet.  26 letters make up all the letters.  Add a few more symbols for punctuation, and you can send a message to mean almost anything.  Now, imagine a smaller amount of symbols to work with.  Lets say 6.  A 4 letter word in the 26 letter alphabet has 26^4 possibilities.  In order to make that many words with only a 6 letter alphabet, you'd need to make the length over 7.  So messages become much longer with a smaller alphabet.  When it comes to computers, the shorter the message, the shorter time it takes to compute.

TL;DR Larger primes allow for shorter messages which means shorter computing time for more complex messages.  "	-1	0

1)  The key, used to encrypt a message, is produced by mathematic algorithms that use prime numbers. If you don't use a prime number, then any factor of the number can be used to ""break"" the key.  For example, if I use the number 12 to generate the key then the numbers 2, 3, 4 or 6 can be used to ""break"" the key.  A ""good"" key is one that is longer than the protected message. Once a key repeats, it is easier to ""break"" an encrypted message. A large prime number allows for a longer key.

2) To ""break"" a key, you have to determine the prime numbers used to generate the key.  It is relatively easy to generate prime numbers, but it is much harder to factor large numbers into primes."	3	0

So if we wanted to make a number which would be hard to find something that divided it, but needed at least two pieces, the easiest way to do that would be to pick the product of two prime numbers - you can only divide it by those two pieces!

A human who is at least somewhat in shape today can still outrun pretty much any wild mammal.

Since these drastically shaped the way our ancestors lived, there was little pressure for them to evolve or maintain defenses like those OP mentioned. Who needs those when you know how to make a spear?

I don't think OP's mention of our immune system is relevant to this conversation. Our sometimes weak immune systems are probably more a product of disuse in advanced societies, although it is possible that the immune systems of westerners are slowly degrading through lack of selection to maintain their strength.

And we have the spring-loaded foot ligaments, the all-over sweat production and hairlessness, the brains to track animals that are miles ahead of us, everything we need to accomplish that.

When I think of the method of human hunting compared to other animals, it actually terrifies me. We are the Terminator. I've had nightmares as a child about monsters that don't stop chasing you and always find you wherever you hide, but that's *exactly what humans did*. Imagine you're a human prey animal: You run away. You think you're safe. But then the human shows up again. You run again. It still finds you. It always finds you.

Forget about claws, and forget about our later developments of weapons and technology. A human that never stops chasing you, and then simply snaps your neck or beats in your skull with a rock, with seemingly infinite reserves of energy when you can't even stand up anymore - that is truly one of the most terrifying hunters in the animal kingdom."	13	0

The hunting hierarchy goes: flight, fins, fours then last of all upright on two feet. Add to that the fact that persistence hunting is a great way to get dehydrated, stalked by other predators, punctured skin for infections (which spelt death back then), sunstroke etc. you can see why it would be better to soar on updrafts before spying a rabbit and falling from the sky to grab it in your talons and quickly ascending to a safe place."	1	0

1. record image or video (just a series of images really)
2. do something called *feature extraction*. That means recognize where in the image the important parts are. In a gesture control this could be the hands of a person (instead of the room behind that person). The result of a feature extraction is much simpler than the whole image, it could be as simple as the position of the center of the hand (x, y coordinates).
3. do something called *classification*, which means trying to interpret the extracted features. The question here could be for example: Did the user do a ""circle"" gesture? Did the user do a ""up-down"" gesture?

So in short: Get image, figure out where the hands are, find out what the hand movement means. 

This will of course mean that you have to have a limited number of gestures which are valid. There are algorithms which can be trained by feeding hand positions into them and ""telling"" them how e.g. a circle looks, a side-to-side movement looks and so on. This then generates a mathematical *model* that can tell the difference in step 3, and if this correctly done even sloppy circles ([like this](http://www.instructables.com/files/deriv/FS8/N5R4/FNNKCKS7/FS8N5R4FNNKCKS7.LARGE.jpg)) will be recognized. An example for such a method is called [support vector machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine).

* Collision Coverage - Damage to your vehicle if you crash it.

* Liability Coverage - Damage to other cars, other people, &amp; other property that you cause in an accident.

* Comprehensive Coverage - Coverage for things like hail, a fallen tree branch, break in/theft, etc. Basically any damage that happens outside of a typical accident.

* Medical payments - Hospital bills for your or the people in your car until liability coverage kicks in.

* Rental car coverage - Cost of a rental car while your car is being repaired due to an accident.

* Towing Coverage - Cost of towing your vehicle due to accident or breakdown.

Those are the main coverages, but some policies have more. As you can probably tell, most of those have nothing to do with the value of your car.  You can do as much damage with a $500 jalopy as with a $50,000 BMW.

**There are ways you can decrease your insurance rate over time, however.** Most insurance companies give you a rate based on an Insurance Score. The formula for coming up with this score varies from company to company, but they almost all look at the following factors:

* # of accidents in the past 3-5 years
* # of tickets in the past 3-5 years
* Credit score
* # of years with the same insurance company
* Misc. Factors: Age, sex, marital status, profession, # of miles driven annually, zip code

So, if you've been with the same company for a while and any of the above have changed for the better, you can call your agent and ask him/her to re-rate you. You'd be surprised how much you can save by having an accident/ticket fall off at the 3-5 year mark, or by having a better credit score. Just keep in mind that this works both ways, so if any of the above have changed for the worse, I'd recommend keeping your mouth shut. : )

Finally, consider other options besides the companies you see on TV. Allstate is a great company but their rates tend to be high. State Farm rates are OK, but their claims service ranges from pretty good to abysmal. Smaller regional companies tend to have the best combination of good rates and good service.

""The most usual BMS divides drivers by classes, where each class has its own discount or surcharge that is applied to the basic premium. **A claim-free year** implies in a **decline of one or more degrees** on the Bonus/Malus class table on the anniversary of the contract. A claim entails an increase of a given number of degrees on the Bonus/Malus scale on the anniversary of the contract. Generally, **one degree corresponds to a 5% discount** or surcharge. The starting class may depend on the driver's age, sex, place of residence, the car's horsepower. Each country has a different legislation, which rules how many degrees an insurer may increase or decrease, the maximum bonus or malus allowed and which statistics insurers can use to evaluate the starting class of a driver.""

Credit score does not measure how responsible you are financially. Interestingly, it is a measure of how much money they can make from you if you have credit with them. Paying a loan early should show responsibility but can negatively affect your credit. This is because the loan issuer will make less money if you pay early. However if you make late payments and the like, there is a chance you end up declaring bankruptcy which doesn't end well for the bank. Also, paying rent and for all necessities does not affect your credit score, even though it is responsible to pay rent before buying a new car. A person who buys a new car on credit (and makes some payments) will have a better credit score than people who responsibly within their means and without loans (even if they buy the same car with cash).	1	0

Credit card was solved by applying for a store card (generally have more lenient requirements), using that for a year &amp; then applying for a credit card again.

Mobile phone was solved by giving them a $200 deposit which they held on my account for 2 years.

I've also heard of people getting CCs, in circumstances where they'd otherwise be rejected, by doing the same deal - you give the CC company a deposit equal to your credit limit and they hold that on the account for a year or two.

There is no giant battery somewhere in the power grid. In the UK we have the ""National Grid"" who are responsible for making sure that the power gets from the generating stations to the consumers according to demand. They have a control centre that (by some trickery and black magic) monitors the consumption vs. generation. In times of need they can call upon hydro-electric power stations like Dinorwig in Wales. This power station can go from 0 to full capacity in 16 or so seconds.

When demand drops off (like at night) the grid simply shuts down generating stations."	3	0

It's pretty difficult to store energy in any form, and electricity has the very nice property of being phenomenally easy to move around (by just tying a bunch of wires together), so they don't store it, and they don't need to.  They just generate it on demand.  

Second:  The electricity system is called a 'grid.'  There are three entities involved in the grid:  The customer, usually a ""retail electric provider"" - someone who sells electricity to an end user like a homeowner or a factory.  The generator, ie the power plant, the guys who produce electricity.  And finally, the Grid Operator (in the US they are called System Operators), ie the person who controls the cables that connect the generators to the customers.  

The Grid Operator is responsible for controlling how much power there is on the grid at any given point in time.  They are the ""Air Traffic Controllers"" for the electric grid.  They sit in a big room full of computers, and monitor how much electricity is where in the grid.  They plan, in advance, how much electricity will be needed and when.  They create this plan based on current and past usage; then they will issue orders to the generators/power plants, telling them what they must produce, and when.  

The grid operator monitors the amount of power in the grid at any given point in time.  As they are monitoring, people are plugging things in and turning them off (the amount of power people are using is called ""load""); meanwhile power plants are spinning up (adding electricity) and spinning down.  This constant variance between the load and the supply has to be monitored, because in order for the grid to 'stay up' - ie, continually provide power, it has to maintain within a certain range, usually determined by voltage.  

You can thing of the grid as a river that ships are using to navigate.  If the water level gets too high, it destroys the things near the river (The machines that people plug into the wall that use electricity).  If the water level (electricity level) gets too low, then ships can't get through and the entire grid will shut down.  The grid operator monitors that and takes action.  In emergencies, if the load is just too large or supply isn't enough, they will actually *disconnect* people (called a planned outage, or brownout) - usually residential customers - to make sure that power isn't lost everyone (especially at places like hospitals).  

Hope this helps.  "	7	0

The electric grid is constantly changing, as demand for electricity goes up and down.  Demand tends to be low during the night, and high during the day.

All over the grid, power plants are producing power.  Some of them are running at 100% all the time.  These are called ""baseload"" power plants.  Some of them are running at less than 100%, or even not running at all!

Because not all of these power plants are running at 100%, they have the ability to produce more than what they're doing at the moment. Let's say you have a coal-fired power plant that is running at 80% capacity.  Then, as temperature get hotter, more people turn on their air-conditioning units and the demand for electricity goes up.  When demand goes up, this coal-fired power plant increases its output to meet the new (higher) demand.

So we have all of these power plants, some of them running at less than their maximum capacity.  The difference between their maximum capacity and their current output is called ""spinning reserve"", that is power that can be called upon very quickly (because the plant is already up and running) in case demand goes up.  The electric grid is required to maintain a certain amount of spinning reserve in case there is a sudden change in demand, or if some other power plant trips offline.

If the demand goes up too high, and all of the power plants are running at 100% capacity, that's dangerous.  If somebody turns on their air-conditioner, it could exceed their capacity and you get a brownout.  To prevent this, they can call on other power plants, that aren't running at all (idle) and tell them to get fired up and ready to go...just in case they're needed.

So they don't store electricity...they just maintain power plants that are available to create electricity as it's needed.

When you open the top, pressure is reduced, so the liquid instantly evaporates. This literally sucks heat from the environment because it takes energy to go from liquid to a gas. When it is upside down, the liquid instead of the gas is being forced out into a much lower pressure system (the outside), so it's in direct contact with whatever is being sprayed,so there is a more dramatic temperature change.	2	0

When relating electric flow to a pipe system as you described here, the current is represented by the amount of fluid present in a given pipe while the voltage is represented by the 'force' that causes the fluid to flow. Resistance does not change the amount of current, or flow, at all. It DOES however affect the voltage. Current through a resistor does not change but there is a voltage drop that is present. So to go back to your analogy, the amount of fluid before and after a resistor will not change but the 'force' that is causing it to flow will decrease.  	2	0

Total current in a circuit is always the same. Current going into a branch and total current when the branches merge back together always need to sum up to the same value.  The water analogy holds...you don't lose any water.  Of course, the current in a straight (non-branching) path is always the same, too. 
  
The current is the dependent variable...it is determined by the voltage and the resistance of the circuit.    
  
When current is forced through a resistor, the voltage ""drops"". The amount of voltage drop across an individual resistor is always IxR. But make sure you look at the voltage on *each side* of the resistor to figure out the ""drop"" (difference or delta).  When one side of the resistor is at ground, then the voltage drop is equal to the input voltage (Vin-0=Vin). But otherwise, you have to be looking at the voltage difference (Vin-Vout).

Twice the cross section, half the resistance.  Just don't mess with their lengths....it's a problem with the water analogy.    
   
I think you are describing a circuit with one piece of piping (resistance R) and then two resistors in parallel (each of resistance 2R). If I got that right, then....   
   
Take 2 resistors of cross sectional area A/2 (each), and that gives rise to each of them having a resistance of 2R, putting them in parallel gives total area A/2+A/2=A and total resistance 2R/2 = R.  Your piping also has resistace of R.  Since the water flows through the entire shebang, it sees a total resistance of R+R=2R.   
   
Why did I add them? Because they each ended up seeing only part of the total voltage.  The piping (resistance R) saw Vin - V1, where V1 is the voltage at the point where the piping hits the resistors.  The resistors see voltage V1-0=V1.    
  
We know the total current is the same in the piping and the resistor network. So (Vin-V1)/R = V1/R .  That means Vin-V1=V1, or V1=Vin/2.

To this point you are correct but this doesn't fully answer the question. The real reason is because while in water, your entire body is submersed in a liquid capable of mimicking the sweating procedure or cooling the body down. Only now, instead of staying on your skin like sweat does, the water  still absorbs heat from your body but is instantly be replaced by different water that has not. This is why SCUBA divers wear thick rubes suits, it minimizes the contact that the water has with a body effectively insulating it.	5	0

Water has a higher heat capacity -- it takes more energy to raise the temperature of water than to raise the temperature of the air. You can think of it (even if it's not an *entirely* accurate view) as the amount of heat a substance can hold. So, water will absorb more of the heat from your body than air will (because it can hold more), making you feel more comfortable in water than in air, which doesn't absorb much of your body heat and thus makes you feel hot.

Similarly, we know dark matter exists because we see its effects on other objects.

To be more specific: when astronomers look at far away galaxies and how they move, they seem to move as if they have more mass than would be in the matter we can see. One possible explanation for this is that there is some (quite a large amount, in fact) matter in galaxies that we can't see, and this provides the extra mass which affects the galaxies' motion. We can't see this ""dark matter"", but we can see how it affects those galaxies. Scientists are doing experiments right now to try and find out more about what it actually consists of.

I know a bit less about dark energy, perhaps someone else can help more here, but I think I can give you the basic idea... Scientists think the universe is expanding. They think this because all distant galaxies seem to be moving away from us. But when we try to measure the speed at which it's expanding, it looks like it's going faster than we'd expect. One possible explanation for why is that there is some extra energy that we haven't accounted for, but we don't know much about what type of energy this is, so we call it ""dark energy"". If I recall correctly, the idea of dark energy is still a controversial one - not all scientists agree with it."	4	0

I believe the exact composition is not yet known, it may be any of these three or even a combination. The consensus is that it is mainly composed of some as yet undiscovered subatomic particle and that most dark matter is non-baryonic (not consisting of particles made of three quarks - if you found that sentence confusing try an ELI5 search for ""standard model"").

&gt; how do we know they're moving faster than they should? What's the control? And how do we measure the mass of a galaxy anyway?

There are different methods for finding the mass of a galaxy. One of the people who first found evidence for the existence of dark matter, Fritz Zwicky, found an estimate for the mass of a cluster of galaxies based on their brightness. Using on this, he calculated the speeds at which the galaxies near the edge of the cluster should orbit. When the orbital speeds were measured, they were 400 times larger than what he had calculated, leading to the belief that there was extra mass. Since then more [observational evidence for the existence of dark matter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter#Observational_evidence) has been found. "	2	0

In a Unix environment (actually, due to the behavior of the shell) you can't insert a space between two words without using an escape (two-stroke) character. The backslash is part of that escape (two-stroke) character. So you have filesystems that look like: /home/user/Pictures, but not /home/user/Vacation Pictures, unless you use a backslash: /home/user/Vacation\ Pictures where ""\ "" (backslash space) is the escape (two-stroke) character.

ASCII chose an 8-bit standard, but with a 7-bit common set (essentially English with punctuation and ""control"" characters) and the extra bit would mark a second 7-bit set for local variation (e.g. non-English characters).

Seven bits gives 128 characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9 consume 62 characters;  32 are used for ""control"" characters like tab, backspace, newline, form feed; and punctuation and arithmetic/math consume the rest. Most of those punctuation and math are the obviously needed ones: 24 slots. There are really only a few characters that would be negotiable:

     # @ \ ^ _ ` { | } ~

Most of these seem familiar now, but I doubt that any seemed essential in 1961.

Typically, computer languages use ""labels"" or ""identifiers"" (usually strings of letters and numbers starting with a letter) and constants separated by punctuation, because punctuation is easier for humans to read and easier for programs, too.

But we have to choose which labels are okay and which punctuation to use. Examples:

 disk1:[user.bob.docs]file.txt  
 c:\user\bob\docs\file.txt  
 /user/bob/docs/file.txt  

The use of slash is the most common choice, or perhaps it's just the most robust survivor among the choices of the 60s--80s. PC DOS and Microsoft MS-DOS chose to use the slash for command line options, so it needed another character for directory paths. And the MS-DOS scheme survives in MS Windows.

HTML is a child of SGML and both use the slash:

 &lt;entry&gt;something&lt;/entry&gt;

And the web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee working on a [NeXTSTEP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTSTEP) operating system which is a Unix-derived system and uses slash in directory paths. As ""A/B"" is ""A over B"", it makes sense that *docs* is under *bob* is under *user*. It's unsurprising the web uses slash.

But Microsoft has the dominant desktop, so the backslash continues to flourish.

The backslash existed in computing before ASCII, though it's not clear how it was used. It was added to ASCII so it could support /\ for AND and \\/ for OR. Mathematicians like those symbols. It's used by Unix. It's used by the C programming language. And it's used by the many many programming languages that derive from the C programming language. It's also used in other environments (e.g. [TeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX)). But backslash is not used for paths in these environments."	5	0

to send a teleport command, from player_a to player_b you could do

&gt;tp player_a player_b

or get player_a to type 

&gt;tp player_b

if the underscores where spaces however:

&gt;tp player_a player b

&gt;tp player b

The problem is, you can not tell if the space character supposed to be a separator between different players or if it is supposed to be a part of a players name.

is it teleporting ""player_a player"" to ""b""?

or ""player_a"" to ""player b""?

 or a completely different player to ""player_a player b""

there is confusion! so by saying that the space character means separation, and that ""\ "" represents a space in a players name, Unix can get users to tell it the difference.

using a ""\ "" is what Pracodayat is calling a two stroke character, which really should be referred to as an escape character.

there are more as well ""\t"" usually being a tab, and ""\n"" being a newline, these arn't the only ones and can vary amongst systems."	15	0

A backslash is more of a side/up cut, with the back of your hand facing forward, like bitchslapping someone. Both are very useful sword techniques, but the important thing to know is when and where to use them. 	-2	0

To understand it, you have to know that '/' is the root of the file system in that system, it doesn't have directory letters. Instead, you see file systems as entities that you can hook up in any point below / - for instance, you create a directory called /foo, which is in the directory foo created under /, and you hook up what would be Windows's C: drive (or something else) under that directory. You can then access it seamlessly, i. e. you don't need to switch between different drives, they're all accessible under the same tree. So if you hook up one file system under /foo and one under /bar, one of which would be C: and the other D: in Windows, you can just say ""ls /foo/Windows"" or ""ls /bar/Games/"", while the Windows equivalent would be ""dir C:\Windows"" or ""dir D:\Games"". It's an entirely different system structure, because / is the same root while C: and D: have nothing in common.

/f would be a file or directory named f created directly under /."	5	0

&gt;In a Unix environment you can't insert a space between two words without using a two-stroke character.

This is a behavior of the shell, and has nothing to do with the underlying OS behavior.  When you write ""/home/user/Vacation\\&amp;nbsp;Pictures"", the shell removes the backslash and interprets the space as part of the path rather than an argument separator.

In other words, it's purely a notational convention.

When you pass arguments directly to [execve(2)](http://linux.die.net/man/2/execve) (or one of its wrappers), this kind of escaping is strictly unnecessary (though the C language may expect you to perform some other kinds of escaping within string literals)."	3	0

Many programming/scripting languages (and markup languages, like markdown which reddit uses) allow you to use the backslash character to cancel out whatever function the character after the backslash would normally do. 

Say you're writing a string in some code. Strings are usually defined by being surrounded in quote characters. But what if you wanted to have a quote inside of the string? The computer would have no way of knowing if it's part of the string or if you want it to denote the end of the string! But, if you just put a \ before it, the computer knows to take it as part of the string!  Example:

    print ""And then she said, \""Yo, what's up!\"" and I walked away.""

With the above inside some code, the output would be:

    And then she said, ""Yo, what's up!"" and I walked away.

As I said, escape characters are used in many places, and it's not always the backslash character. Give the [Wiki article a look](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_character)."	3	0

It dates back to Latin (where it was used in a similar manner to how we use the comma), and became used as shorthand for and/or centuries ago. The backslash, on the other hand, was a wholly new symbol created in the 1961 exclusively for computing applications. 

Interestingly, 'slash' as a word has entered the vernacular as slang in recent years – people say it in sentences, but also write out (as in, ""She was my best friend slash harshest critic."") This is rather remarkable, because while slang gives us lots of new nouns and verbs, it's quite rare that it gives us a new conjunction."	27	0

This is because it effectively escapes the normal functionality of a character.

In Pracodayat's file path example, the \\ in ""\\ "" tells the computer ""This isn't a normal space, treat it like a character, rather than an argument separator."".

Similarly, \\n represents an endline character (since you can't just press enter to communicate that you want an endline), and \\r means a carriage return (an archaic remnant of the days of digital typewriters.  Notepad uses carriage returns instead of endlines, which is why it fails to recognize formatted text when you paste into it.).  Also, \\t represents the tab character, which automatically arranges by column.

The most interesting, however, is when you want to write \\ itself.  Because it is the escape character, it attempts to modify whatever character comes after it, and disappears in the process.

In order to actually include \\, you must *escape the escape character*, by writing \\\\.  This gets even more insane when you need to include the backslash character in a string that will be parsed twice, as you'll need to escape the escape characters that are already escaping other escape characters, which looks like this: \\\\\\\\.

Now, if you want to include an endline in a string that will be parsed twice (such as putting code into a string to evaluate later), you need to write it as \\\\n.  

It's a complex system to wrap your head around, but it makes sense when you think about it.  "	2	0

-r is a switch that tells rm to delete folders and all items in said folders

-f means it will delete without asking ""OK to delete this file?""

/ is the root directory in a Unix system.

Thus, rm -rf / tells the shell to delete every file and folder on the system. This will completely hose the system.

Basically, telling someone to do this is the equivalent of telling a Windows user to delete c:\Windows, except that it is more destructive as it will delete everything on all mounted drives.

Most modern Unix systems will not allow this command to be run without making some changes to config files as there is no legitimate reason to do this (a quick format will erase a drive faster, and overwriting with random bits will erase a drive more securely). Still, I would not advise trying to run it."	5	0

If a magnet is pulled by another magnet, it has potential energy which is similar to how something pulled by a gravitational field has potential energy. If you were to let go of the magnet, it would be pulled towards the other and start moving. It's movement means that you are converting potential energy to kinetic energy, but you only have so much potential. In order to reset this, you need to put energy back into the system to increase the magnet's potential energy again.

It's like if you were holding a rock over the ground. You can feel the force between the rock and the ground. You can release the rock and it's potential energy is converted to kinetic energy as it falls.

If you extracted energy from two magnets strapping together, you need the same amount of energy to pull them apart again. Turning one magnet around once they snapped together requires about the same amount of energy too, **it all balances out**."	1	0

When you hold 2 magnets you don't feel energy, you feel force. Force is basically how hard something is being pushed. In order to get energy out of it you need to do work, which is force times the distance. Basically it is harder to push an object 10 feet than 1 foot.

Lets say you have 2 magnets and they are pushing against each other (repelling). This is basically like a spring. Springs store energy, when you push it together you feel a force and the spring stores this energy. The more you squeeze the spring the more it will push back. When you release the spring it will expand to its original size. This is releasing the energy you stored.

On magnets if you push them together and let it drive something when they return, you net nothing, in fact you only lose energy (goes to heat technically) due to physics."	1	0

Gravity and magnetism share similarities - they are both potential energy that is determined by the positions of objects in the system. For example, the closer two magnets are, the greater the force you'll feel between them.

So, we can look at gravity to see if such machine can be built. If you let something fall, it will gain kinetic energy. Can you get useful work out of this kinetic energy? Of course - it can fall on some unfortunate soul's toes. However, once it's used up, it's used up. You can't have it return to its original height if you've extracted energy from the system.

Conversely, you can let it go back to its original height - like rolling a marble down a bowl, and having it roll back up the other side. But you'll also note that when it reaches its original height, it no longer has any kinetic energy left. It requires the exact amount of energy you can get out of a falling object to put it back up to its original position.

It is the same with magnets. Any attraction or repulsion between magnets can rotate some gear system, but it won't have any excess energy left over to be extracted if you want it to return to its original position."	1	0

I'm going to use gravity to explain it, because I think it's a little cleaner that way, but the same principle also applies to magnetic and electrical forces.

So, as you know, when you lift an object up and let go, it falls. The way that physicists explain it is that you've given the object potential energy by lifting it up, and that potential energy gets released when you let go, turning into kinetic energy (motion).

One of the key things to note is that it doesn't matter *how* you lift the object, it always falls in the exact same way, assuming you release it from the same height. You can lift it slowly, you can lift it fast, you can lift it by putting it on a forklift and driving around in circles while the lift raises the height. It does not matter.

We call this ""path independence."" It doesn't matter what path the object takes to get from point A (the ground) to point B (the height it's being dropped from), it will always fall the same way, because the potential energy is always the same.

The reason that this is relevant is that gravity-based perpetual motion/unlimited energy machines nearly always rely on trying to find some clever way to get an object up high so that you can steal the energy it releases when it comes back down.

One of the most common designs is the [unbalanced wheel](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Perpetuum1.png), which supposedly would work because the weights on one side of the wheel are farther away and thus generate a torque (rotation). Supposedly, then, the weights on the left side use less energy to get lifted upwards than the weights on the right generate by falling. We, with our awesome knowledge of path independence, know that that's not true, though. It takes/generates the same amount of energy to get from the bottom of the wheel to the top, no matter how you try to get there!

Now, the connection to magnets is a little more nuanced. Suffice to say that mathematically, magnetic and gravitational fields are both ""conservative,"" which means that magnetic fields are path-independent just like gravity. It doesn't matter how convoluted or clever your design is, there's simply no way to ""trick"" magnetism into generating free energy.

note: technically, magnetic fields do not meet *all* of the definitions of a conservative field, but they meet the relevant one here (path independence)"	1	0

Many wines will have lists of flavours you'll notice, but you're not allowed to add anything other than grapes, or it's not wine. So to get those flavour notes, they may rotate grapes through soil that previously hosted things like apricots, apples, and pears, to pull hints of them into the grapes. 

Other conditions that our host explained were soil depth and content, elevation, exposure to sun, exposure to shade, and even the time of day or pattern by which a grape came to those conditions (Eg. A grape that gets intense heat followed by cool and shade will taste different than a grape that gets shade and then heat, or so he said). Also a season (or certain side of the mountain) which is cool for the first half of the growing season, but warms up for the second half. 

By the time grapes make it through to wine, they've also been aged in barrels, and finer wine typically ages in a brand new French-made oak barrel. Lower-level wines will age in previously used barrels, or American-made oak, which was seen to be not as good there. "	5	0

Both the terroir *and* the grape variety are requirements for an AOC, and sometimes even the bottling location is.

Outside of all this, wines are definitely categorised by-the-grape by consumers in Europe, too. It is a first indication of the style of wine and hence the flavours to be expected, much more so than the terroir which is a refinement on top of those flavours.

Of course, the French will usually consider anything that did not come from France as inferior and not fit for consumption. But that's a French thing...

They’re also pretty intimidating to the uninitiated. It doesn’t help that more often than not, wines on the shelf are some kind of mix of several different grapes to produce an interesting flavour.

Example: you mentioned pink wine. In the biz, that generally gets called a rosé (“Roz-ay”), and it’s a great summer daytime wine with a fruity flavour that’s not too intense. A rosé is usually a white wine that’s had a chance to ferment with red grape skins.

Example: Tempranillos are great red grapes that give a strong vanilla flavour and deep purple hue, but they’re a little intense alone. Most tempranillo wines are about 90% tempranillo grapes, and 10% something else.

A lot of wine taste isn’t so much about the pure flavour of the wine so much as it’s about “pairing” or choosing a wine that will go well with a type of food and atmosphere. Take the idea of a wine’s “body” or thickness. In white wine, three major varieties are riesling, sauvignon blanc, and chardonnay (just grape types here). They have different body types. Think skim milk, whole milk, and cream. You wouldn’t serve heavy cream with a light lemon flavoured white-fish, would you? Probably not, for the same reason you wouldn’t serve a porterhouse steak with a glass of water. The steak can take the weight of the stronger wine without getting overpowered.

It’s the same story with common red varieties:

* Body types:	**Red**,	 **White**
* Skim milk:	        *Pinot Noir*,	    *Riesling*
* Whole milk:	  *Merlot*,	*Sauvignon Blanc*
* Cream:		*Cabernet*,	  *Chardonnay*

Let’s say we forget food, what’s a good wine to just have and drink at a party or out on the deck? Is it a hot sunny day, or has the sun gone down and the temperature dropped to a tolerable 65F? You can probably enjoy something a little more substantial, but would enjoy a light rosé on a hotter day.

-	Where were they grown?

The same grapes can be grown in different regions to make different wines. Chardonnay is one of the grapes which can be used to make Burgundy, Chablis and Champagne, all wines named after their origins.
Lots of ink gets spilled writing and discussing the minutia of where the grapes are grown. People go nuts over the “terroire” and the unique flavours which show up in the grapes of a particular area, sometimes even a particular area of the field, or a specific vine. Frankly, I think it’s splitting hairs. Lots of European countries have taken price in their traditional food-stuffs by reserving labels for crops grown in special regions (perhaps none so more than France which reserves the appellation d'origine contrôlée or AOC label for lentils, cheese, honey and over 300 wines). These foods get a hefty pricetag because they are scarce by nature of being only capable of being grown in the small areas they come from. In wines, since the classic flavour comes from a specific type of soil, there’s a real limit to how much farmers can produce. Take Bordeaux wines. They’re like a hundred bucks for a “nice” bottle (let alone a “good” or “very good”). They have a unique flavour that comes from being grown in a particularly interesting riverside soil rich in stone and clay. As far as it’s possible to replicate a wine taste, Bordeauxs are pretty unique.

Except they’re not. 

During 18th century, French winemakers brought their grapes and techniques to Spain and the Valencia-Rioja regions. They planted Bordeaux-type grapes in riversides a lot like those in Bordeaux. The result is that today you can buy good “Riojas” from spain that taste like a Bordeaux at a fraction of the price. If you want a great red wine for a good price, you can generally do well with a *Tempranillo Reserva* from your liquor store’s Spanish aisle.

-	How were they stored and processed?

Another important element is the storage of the wine, usually in oak casks for periods of a year or more. Much like whiskey, which tastes like slightly sweet and sickly vodka when it comes out a still, lots of flavour comes from interaction with the oak cask the wine is stored in. Going back to Chardonnay, it can get a very strong “oaky” taste which gives it a strong butter flavour. I really like this taste, but it’s not for everyone. Imagine having a glass with a bowl of clam pasta with a garlic butter sauce. Simple and delicious!

***

Just in closing, wine gets pretty mysterious and it can be a pretty complicated thing, kind of like Mystery Science Theater or the variety of hamburger outlets in the Western Coastal states of America. There's a lot of variety and people with plenty of opinions, sometimes boisterous, about the variety. It can make good people intimidated and shitty people snobby and elitist. 

Wine has a huge hipster-image problem, maybe even a worse reputation than hipsters get! It doesn't have to be this way. I don't know a lot and am probably wrong about a few of the things I've said here today, but I like learning and when I buy a new bottle, I always ask myself what I like and would I drink this again? If you can do that under the budget and play around in the isles (Unfortunately for a lot of people, by drinking a little less alcohol to enjoy drinking a little better), you can have a really great experience with the grapes.

See you in vines!"	177	0

To make it simple, the expensive wines are generally more complex than cheaper wines. Whether this complexity is positive or negative often depends on how the wine is served and more importantly, when a wine is served. The really pricey wines ($40-$1,000+) are generally so complex, they don't taste very good this side of a 10-20 year aging period. If opened too young, the flavors will be disjointed and overpowering, often with harsh or bitter tannins on the finish that dry your mouth out. But take that same bottle and carefully age it (ie: 55 degrees F, low light, medium humidity, no vibration) it ""becomes"" worth it's high price. Wine is not cocacola, it ""evolves"" in the bottle, sometimes for the better, sometimes not. There are differences, very striking sometimes, between cheap and expensive wines."	2	0

Color:
But, the taste of wine is strongly based in varietals and region (which they can identify.)

A Pinot Noir will seem lighter than a thick oaky Chardonnay. White to red isn't necessarily a sliding scale of mild to strong.

Color is enhanced by leaving the skins on. The -same- grapes can make a red or white wine. Tannins are variable. 

Cost:
Cost is relative. Perception of cost is consistent. 

Those Armani heels, that JPG dress, that Gucci purse- are they worth more?
It depends. The quality may be slightly better than other mid range products that go for a portion of the price- but the cost also comes from the name brand, the hype, the perception, the resale value (equally based on perception.)

If you took a ""concept"" dress design and told half of a group it was AlexAnder McQueen and the other half it was Target how would they vote?
It doesn't mean that these same people are any worse at identifying fabric or fashion origins.  

Different scores:
Eat the same food, smell the same smell for 15 minutes your perception changes, coupled with ideas of prestige and your own bias- it makes sense that opinions will fluctuate. Maybe judge number 3s pallet said ""ok- enough of this"" he had some water ""oh this is refreshing again""

The point wasn't whether the wine should cost $10 or $100, it was that often judges can't tell the difference between good and bad wine, red or white wine, etc.

In regards to your clothing analogy:  I may not be able to tell if a shirt should should cost $10 or $100, but I *can* tell the difference between silk and cotton, if it fits or doesn't, if it looks nice or not.  This shirt has a collar, this shirt has buttons...

I can accept that when while being under the impression you're tasting different wines when they're really the same may lead you to slightly alter your scores, or that you simply tire of the taste.  But even *I* can tell the difference between the taste of a red and a white, and I know very little of wine.  If someone is identified as a wine expert, they should be accurate in their analysis about the different tastes of wine.  So either many prominent experts are frauds, or the complexity within the flavor of wine is fictional.

  The only relation I see to cost is that if experts can't accurately judge the quality of a wine, neither can it's cost.  Perhaps a bottle is expensive because it's rare, because it's a statement of wealth, or because it's difficult to make.  But the cost won't represent it's quality if experts can't even identify it."	6	0

I went to a beginners wine tasting class, and our teacher had a just-for-fun part at the end where he served us from wine bottles whose labels were hidden and let us decide which we liked and why. Most of the class preferred a certain wine, rating it higher in certain categories. At the end, he revealed that we'd rated a well-crafted $8 bottle of wine higher than a best-selling $15 Kendall Jackson.

Grapes have a lot of variation like that, too. The different grape flavours are the start of what makes wines different from one another.

Then there is the process for how the grapes are fermented. Red wines get their colour from the red skins. White wines are either green-skin or red grapes with the skin removed (like Cabernet Sauv).

Then there is how the wine is aged. Oak aging used to mean the wine is aged in oak caskets before bottling. Nowadays they cheat and float a piece of oak lumber in the batch while it ages.

[This site](http://www.wineportfolio.com/sectionLearnWineGlasses-New-World-Vs-Old-World-Wines.html)explains that idea well.  


This little idea--of, say, Californian or Australian wines being very bold in flavor so they can keep up with the strong flavors of the cuisine in those areas--has helped me choose wines in a pinch. Is the flavor of this meal a little more delicate? Try an Old World wine which will complement rather than overpower it. A master sommelier could certainly do better, but since I don't know any, this has worked pretty well!  


Also, I was surprised to find that some of the ridiculous-sounding concerns of high-brow wine lovers were indeed true.  


For instance, breathing in the nose, or scent, of wine is a part of tasting you don't want to skip. You see the fancy wine guys get their noses right in the glass, really getting good sniffs.  Now i do this, too, and found that I LOVE the difference from wine to wine.   


The other aspect of tasting that I was surprised to find the wine masters were right about? Air, or letting the wine ""breathe"". It's amazing that wine just uncorked will taste noticeably different (and IMO not as good and delicious) as one that has been uncorked for a few minutes and swirled around in your glass. ""Wine is a living thing,"" the wine lover told me. After trying the wine just uncorked and then minutes later when it has ""bloomed"" as air mingles with it, I believed him. (It can get even more precise, like with special decanting pourers and certain glasses for certain wines. I thought they were crazy, but it can taste different!).  


Here is the biggest ELI5 moment I had about wine: opened old wine is just old and bad. I'd previously thought that ""Wine gets better with age"" meant that if you and I opened a bottle today and then had some of that bottle a year later, it'd be super-great! Nooooo. The wine-better-with-age idea only applies to bottles that are still corked and stored in cool, dry conditions. Sounds obvious, but my aunt and uncle still think that months-old leftover wine at the back of their fridge is magically delicious. I think it could strip paint better than accompany a meal. All the yummies are gone.  


An easy wine-buying tip (for beginners like me who don't know where to start) was to try wines from their famous region.  Not that others won't be good, but this is just a fun way to start, since there are so many wines. I like to raid the bargain bins and look for Frenchy-sounding wines from France, Italian-sounding wines from Italy, etc. It always turns out great!  There are [actual lists](http://www.wineeducation.com/grapesregions.html) of wine regions and their famous wines. totally helpful.  


Also: Chilean or Argentinian Malbec is so, so good.  



And that is all I have ever learned about wine. :-)

I rarely spend more than AUD$20 on a bottle (alcohol is expensive in Aus). Because there are SHITLOADS of brilliant wines for that price, especially if you know the winery region. One of the best wines I ever tasted ( and I've tasted my share ) was a $25 bottle of shiraz from a tiny little winery that has long since closed. Beat the shit out of even the winery's own $50-70 top-range stuff.

One of the worst was $120 bottle from a nameless winery that sells mostly into high class restaurants and hotels at massive markup *on top* of their 'bargain' rate $120.

Wine is a mix of personal preference and winemaking skill. Price is about skill and hype and volume and all sorts of other shit that has little relevance to taste.

I *think* I could tell the difference between many red and white wines.  But for someone to claim to be an expert, I would definitely expect them to be able to.  The judges even used red wine terms to describe the fake red wine and the process it went through to earn that taste.

So I guess...yeah.  That's more or less what I'm saying.  Maybe not literally, and I don't know where you're getting ""never even had wine before"" from, but for someone who claims to be an expert in wine to not be able to tell the difference between a red and white leads me to believe they are no expert at all.

Here is the most simply drawn out explanation. Different grape combinations result in different wines completely. The main differences in wines are color, dryness, nose, body, and finish. Colors typically range from red to white, but like you said there are pink wines such as the dry Rose or the disgustingly sweet White Zinfandel. They can also range from colors of gold, amber, and even really odd translucent browns and other strange colors. The reason these wines look the way they are is typically just the grapes they use, but age also can have a major role in that.

Taste, depending on the wine, is also a result of the grapes and yeasts used. Typically a red is fuller, more dark and berry like, where whites can range from oak and butter to crisp pear and grapefruit. These grape varietals are grapes from across the world, and each country has their own unique style. French wines are earthy and pungent, while Italian wines can be stronger in intensity while finishing with an acrid taste. Australian wines are bold, rich, licorice and juicy plum beasts of alcohol. Spain and South America has intense bell peppery spices with dashes of flavorful dark cherry bite. New Zealand creates a fantastic citrus flavored Sauvignon Blanc and rich and delicious Pinot Noir that is one of the best selling summer wines. American wines are the widest margin of wines, from ""fruit bombs"" to refined vanilla filled sophistication.

There are plenty of distinguishing factors of bottles. Oak, the cask vessel of wine for hundreds of years, is incredibly important in its presence or absence; with oak aging you add a vanilla and butter flavor, without it you maintain the rich and intense fruit of the grapes. The vintage date is quintessential of a wine, revealing if the wine will still be firm and unrelenting or soft and easily drinkable.

There are table wines, wines that can be paired with very specific foods, desert wines, etc. Honestly the best way to figure out wine is to just drink it.

(I know this was a little much, but I have a serious boner for wine.)"	2	0

I might be using shark teeth, conch shells and crabs.

This doesn't mean that next years fashion is going to be women decked out in chunks of driftwood and dead crabs. But I did paint a very powerful picture in terms of fabrics, colors, themes and accessories.

Designers can take inspiration from that and design entire lines of clothing with coherent themes and matching clothing in terms of the types of fabrics, the methods of sewing and folding, colors etc. Their designs are going to be a lot less crazy than mine but they're all adhering to the style guide I created with my crazy designs.

The image a luxury brand like that normally wishes to portray is that of a high-end lifestyle; celebrities, the wealthy, those that many people idolize.

A CEO and his wife at a dinner party, maybe someone notices the bag and decides they want one like it, they know what it is and will get one.  Done and done.  They get into their Mercedes or Porsche the next day and go buy one, maybe a couple others to go with other outfits. What they want to avoid is the girl climbing out of her '93 Civic and heading towards Wal-mart, proudly carrying her 'Prada' bag.  Is there anything wrong with someone doing that?  Of course not, but it isn't their image, and it is extremely unlikely to make someone go 'Wow, what a nice bag, I'll go ahead and drop $800 on one myself.'  Most people will assume the bag was fake, but maybe it isn't?  Well, if they could afford it, now they don't want it, that person had one, and they can do better.

Another side to it is that these knock-offs are quite possibly the product of extremely long hours of child labor, or under other less-than-desirable conditions, and without demand, supply would diminish.  This issue is much bigger, in and of itself, so I'm not going to expand on it, but obviously many people would prefer that others not have to spend 12+ hour days in a factory being paid pennies, just so people can *look* like they have money.

Last reason I'll mention is that they are almost always far lesser quality, so if someone doesn't know better and buys a knock-off product, then it falls apart in a few days/weeks, what are the chances they buy another?  This is assuming they paid a high price and thought they were receiving a genuine product.  You didn't specify if you meant $10 street-corner fakes, or high-end fraudulent products, but I feel these three points should mostly cover it, though I'm certain there are other reasons.

1. At least some people who will buy the fake would have bought the real one if the fakes weren't available, so you are costing the real brand at least some sales.

2. The fakes are often very low quality, and some people will see their friends with the fake and not know it's a fake, and then have a bad impression of the real brand.  (""My friend had a Prada bag, and it tore in like 2 weeks."")

3. Part of what you are paying for with a luxury brand is exclusivity.  If tons of people have the brand, then it's no big deal.  And when most people who, say, have a Prada-looking bag actually have a fake, that really hurts the brand.  (Instead of thinking Prada is a special luxury brand, people think ""Oh, everyone has those, and they're really tacky - you can just buy them for $20 in Chinatown."", and even people who can afford a real one might not even want it because of that.)"	2	0

It is used to add expression to long notes (which can sound quite boring otherwise).

When using vibrato, it's possible to alter the speed of the vibrato, and also the amount of vibrato (how much the pitch of the note is changed), either during the note or from one note to the next, to get the required expression.

The way in which vibrato is applied varies depending on the type of instrument. In wind instruments, it's done using the diaphragm, pushing a little bit more air out to raise the pitch of the note. It requires a lot of practice to build the required strength in the diaphragm. Singers can use the same technique, or can use the larynx instead. Players of string instruments move the fingers of their left hand slightly to change the pitch of the note."	1	0

Lots of ice at the poles, possibly underground river system,  AND most importantly, all the dirt near  Curiosity (the rover) is 2 percent water. So we can extract that and have as much water as we need to survive and thrive and take over the whole planet!!! But some astronauts will die getting there.  Also getting to Titan will take a LONG time -- many years. The American plan is to take 6 monts to get to Mars,  6 months there, then 6 months back based on the orbits lining up.  The Russian plan is to go straight there in 2 months, stay as long as they want, then 2 months to get home, but it's trickier to do it that way,  easier to miscalculate.  So by 2030 we should have the first try at humans on another planet.  It will be great!!!!! I hope that helped answer your question a little bit.	2	0

Missions are generally planned around cost vs scientific return, right now it looks very likely that Mars was once a habitable planet with large amounts of liquid water on the surface which leads to a very real likelihood that there was once life there. Therefore missions to Mars are still very scientifically interesting, it's relatively easy to get there and as sensor technology improves there's a very real chance of being able to detect signs of past life (and even the remote possibility of present life underground.

Titan on the other hand is known to be too cold for known water based life at the surface, and non-water based life is extremely speculative. It's possible Titan has a sub-surface ocean (like Europa is believed to have), but currently we don't have the technology to send a probe through ice like that.

That means a mission to Titan with current technology would likely only be able to confirm what we already know from the Cassini misison. We need to wait for new technological breakthroughs to make the cost vs scientific return worthwhile."	3	0

Where should the first colony be? Near one of the poles to take advantage of the ice or a place with better terrain?  Also the American spaceships with 6 or so Mars explorers are probably going to be built at the international space station, use plasma prpulsion( if we get it powerful enough by then), and will will rotate to cause some artificial gravity.  I'm also excited as are you for getting there. But astronauts will die getting there.  I hope that doesn't halt the program in its tracks.  Which method would you prefer -- American ( bigger and slower and safer) or the Russian plan (smaller, faster, but riskier) for getting there? Another space race!!!! Finally !!!!!!  One more thing, how will men and women ( or men and men or women and women) have sex in space?So many questions. I love it!!!! I'll check out the asteroid mining. 	2	0

a) **Data which is large enough in volume that traditional methods of storing or processing the data are impractical**. Storage is very cheap now, and companies increasingly accumulate larger and larger volumes of data. At some point, having a single machine store and churn through the data becomes impractical, and Big Data technologies come into play. This usually involves using many connected machines to store and process data simultaneously, rather than a single powerful server.

b) **Data which comes from lots of different sources, in a variety of formats**. For example, companies are now very interested in analysing data from social networks like Facebook and Twitter. The huge variety of data sources can make consuming and processing all of the data difficult using traditional tools and techniques.

""Big Data"" is currently a bit of a buzzword. Be aware that people will throw around the term when it may not be appropriate, mostly because it sounds cool and impressive. Some companies will also invest in Big Data tools/technology when it may not actually be necessary - it is quite common for companies to have an over-inflated view of the size/complexity of the data they are working with, and so they might be using Big data tools when traditional approaches would still be suitable (and perhaps more cost efficient)."	5	0

The differentiation between Big Data and normal data is Big Data usually is so large and complex that processing/analysis is difficult using standard database technologies.

Companies dealing with Big Data will either design their own implementations for handling the data, or use something like [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) or [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.com/solutions/big-data). The idea is that when you are dealing with extremely large/complex data sets, just doing a Select * statement isn't going to be fast or efficient enough - these other tools have functions built in like [MapReduce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce) that are designed to be a more efficient way of grouping and returning data.

At my old job, the engineers were using MongoDB to track analytics on the apps we released across several million users. So analytics that were large, and complex (e.g. what if we want to track, per app, the specific paths that users take through the application? Or the pages that are visited most often by time of day?). These things *might* be accomplished using a standard NoSQL/MySQL vanilla setup, but it would be less efficient than something designed for Big Data - meaning that things like our live-feed of analytics (it looked fucking awesome) could present data that sometimes ranged into the hundreds of thousands of events per second.

If your company is dealing with larger data sets, it would be worth looking into Hadoop at minimum and doing some reading into how it can work for Big Data Sets."	2	0

Many restaurants have outside software that keeps track of how the bill is paid, and some iterations of the software (I am told) make it difficult to put in multiple payers.  Even in places with basic register-type systems, like where I worked, dividing the check up means more work for the server (different bills, different piles of change) and can be a real hassle when it's busy. 

As for cost, it can cost more for credit cards.  as noted [here](http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/483-small-business-accepting-credit-cards.html) in addition to a percentage, which is the same no matter how many checks, there is also usually a flat fee that the business pays to the credit using a credit card at the time of the swipe.  So if five people order 8 dollar lunches and pay on one card, the swipe costs, say, 60 cents + some percent of $40.  If they pay on 5 cards it costs 3 dollars + the percent. and that ads up over time. inconvenience is the bigger factor though. "	1	0

More importantly, grounding things makes them safer to use.  By having the chassis of a device connected directly to a local ground, if a dangerous current somehow manages to develop inside the device, it shorts straight to ground, rather than into the user.  The reason we use a local ground (the ground prong in an electrical outlet will go straight to a pipe or another metallic object stuck in the ground) is because it is the path of least resistance--slightly less resistance, even, than the neutral wire in the outlet.  If you connect an ohmmeter between the neutral wire and the ground wire, it will appear to indicate continuity, but there's still a little bit of resistance between the two.	2	0

In the US we have split phase wiring in most/all residential housing.  We have center tapped 220V wiring, which has 3 lines coming in, we'll call the A, B, and C.  B is tied to ground at the panel.  A and C have 220 Volts and are used for air conditioners, electrical dryers, and so forth.  

Between A and B, and B and C, there is 110 volts, and roughly half of all circuits on on the AB phase and the other half are on BC.  

If you have a kitchen and have a defective toaster and mixer where the positive lines are in contact with the case then if you touch both at the same time you will be shocked with 220V and will have a bad day (or your last day)

If you tie the case to ground, then if the positive line touches the case then it will short out and trip a circuit breaker.  

Alternatively, you can use a GFCI, which measures the current going out and coming back in, and if they differ by 5 milliamps it will trip.  It will assume that the 5+ milliamps is going through something it shouldn't be (ie you), and will save you.  "	2	0

Amperage is a lot like how much water is flowing in a river, and voltage is sort of like a waterfall where the higher the voltage the higher the waterfall and the more it hurts when you stand at the bottom of it. The higher the voltage the more dangerous it is. 110 volts of household supplied power can kill you. But typically it just makes your fingers twitch. 220V can easily kill you.  10,000+ volts (power lines) can turn squirrels into flaming bits of hair. 

Voltage is current times resistance. 

In reality it is the amperage that kills you, and it doesn't take much to do it passing through your heart. However, your skin has a fair amount of resistance so the voltage has to be  fairly high. A taser has high voltage by very little current. 

If you multiply the voltage and amperage you get wattage, or watts. If you take watts times hours you get watt hours (or more often kilowatt hours) which is what the electric company bills you for.

One reason for doing this is that it means there's no way that part of the engine can accidentally acquire a potential where it shouldn't, since it's strapped to the negative terminal of the battery.

You could hold a 1 volt dc or 60 hz AC source in each hand capable of generating a million amps (pretty much impossible outside of this thought experiment because of the internal resistance of power sources and the wires leading from them) all day assuming your hands were dry because the resistance in your skin would be high enough to not let the current through and you wouldn't feel anything.  If it is a higher frequency AC (say 50,000 hertz) I'm not sure what that would do to your skin resistance.  As a non trivial example you can touch both sides of a car battery (12v dc) even though the battery can produce several hundred amps. 

Do the same thing with 220 volts AC and you will likely die.  Skin resistance with AC is lower than DC which was the basis of the nasty Tesla/Edison AC/DC fight back in the day which had Edison electrocuting animals including elephants to show how dangerous AC is 

Do the same thing with 10,000 volts and you will possibly catch on fire or at minimum lose your hands.  If you are a tweaker who steals copper this is why you don't steal live power lines more than once. As a pro tip, even if you turn off the power on high voltage systems (say 1000v+) unless the voltage is drained they will still act as a capacitor (sort of like a battery) well enough to make your day really suck.

Actually, with a battery powered circuit, you don't even connect them at a separate location. You connect the ground and the return to the exact same place: the negative terminal of the battery. Hence why I say that ground and return are basically the same thing, in a battery powered circuit.

&gt; My understanding from the responses has been that the ground absorbs excess voltage that builds up for whatever reason. 

A good ground will do that. A good ground stays rock-solid at 0 volts no matter what. But not all grounds are good. A bad, crummy ground might fluctuate 50 mV around ""true"" ground depending on what else was happening in the circuit.

Mythology is the stories behind a religion (old style or, well, less old).  Currently religions such as Islam, Christianity, Hinduism, and Buddhism (which some argue is a philosophy not a religion) all have mythologies associated with them, but in every day speech the word mythology often connotes something ancient, no-longer followed, and simplistic.  Followers of active religions have an understandable aversion to thinking of their religions in that manner.

Also, everyone ""knows"" that a myth is just a story.  A story that has a moral and a purpose, but it is understood that a myth didn't actually happen... Promethius didn't really steal fire from the gods, Raven didn't really steal daylight from the giants, Odin didn't really hang himslelf from the branches of Yggdrasil to gain wisdom and have the runes burned into his neck.  Those are just stories people told to explain things.  Similar stories told in active religions (Moses turning his staff to a serpent, walking on water, Lot's wife turning into a pillar of salt) are often taken more literally by believers of the religion and resist the mythological and metaphorical aspects of the stories.

CNoitez brings up a good point, that present day religions have a different form than the ones we currently call mythologies.  The word ""religion"" has strongly hierarchical associations for many people that are different from how the Greek or Norse (etc) gods were worshiped."	1	0

If you want me to expand on something, I will but I'll try to keep this short: (the real short is sje46 is spot on)

The responses to this post such as ""they didn't really believe all that"" or ""oh they only read it allegorically!"" is exactly why Greek myth is referred to as mythology. Though technically mythology isn't meant to imply fiction (you can say 'Christian mythology' in academia and be a devout Baptist), we all know it's taken on that meaning. It's meant to render something as ludicrous which the entire internet can show you is easy to do.

Well, it is easy to make fun of something or knock it down. But the original people who started the ""they didn't really believe"" or ""allegorical"" BS for Greek myth didn't want to actually knock it down. They were Renaissance-era Europeans who knew damned well they owed their roots and empire-driven nature to Greece and Rome.  They taught Latin in schools and revered Aristotle and Plato. But how can those good Christian pupils revere old pagan philosophers? 

Let's make an excuse. We'll say they didn't really mean it or that they were sensible enough to see it...umm...allegorically! Yeah! That's it! The Europeans were faced with the dilemma of liking their predecessors but feeling the need to somehow claim that the old religion was ludicrous and the current one was comparatively refined (and somehow forget that the current religion included a guy being eaten by a whale and people turning into salt.)

Don't let people tell you that the Greeks were somehow not devout. I can't tell you how many myths there are of Artemis getting her knickers in a twist and cruelly slaughtering people who didn't pay homage. Temples were as common as churches in the south and people had favorite patron deities they prayed to with gusto. Rituals were a huge part of daily life. Oh and let's try not to forget that Socrates was actually murdered by the state for questioning the religious status quo?

Edit: sorry. Too many absolutes. Bear in mind that when you exceed talking about one person, variety comes into play. GENERALLY we have hefty evidence Greek were religious nuts but that doesn't mean you didn't have people (like Socrates) saying it was a load of BS or generally apathetic about everything.

All that shizz about talking snakes and giant floods? That's the mythology behind it.

Mythology isn't necessarily fiction. But it's the literature behind a religion (literature can be either fiction or non-fiction). The tales of Odysseus and Achilles were told in poems like the Illiad - that's the mythology.

Water runs through this combustion chamber in many small, winding pipes (a construction called a ""heat exchanger""), which is how the water is heated. This works pretty well, and you can extract most of the heat gained from burning the fuel this way.

However, some heat that's pretty hard to extract in a normal setup is heat that's *stored in the water in the exhaust*.  When you burn fuel, the products of that reaction (assuming complete combustion - so no unburnt fuel) are mostly carbon dioxide and water (along with other products that depend mostly on the temperature of the combustion process and the exhaust, like carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, and other, weirder products). 

Now that water, since it's very hot, is produced in gaseous form (as water vapor), not liquid water. That means that there's a significant amount of heat still trapped in that water vapor (water has a very high ""heat of vaporization"", which is the amount of energy required/released when it changes from a liquid to a gas). But it's essentially impossible, in an ordinary boiler, to extract that heat, because if the water condenses on the cold water pipes of the heat exchanger, it would usually just drop back down into the combustion chamber and evaporate again.  

What a condensing boiler does is that it manages to extract that heat from the water.  It takes the exhaust gas from the ordinary boiler (which is still pretty hot, even after it is used to heat up the water) and runs that exhaust gas through a second heat exchanger, where it is used to heat up the cold water before it enters the main boiler.  Since there's no direct source of heat in the second heat exchanger, the water vapor that's still in gas form when it leaves the main boiler can condense on the heat exchanger tubing into liquid water and release that stored heat into the water (where you want it to go!) instead of just having it go up the chimney with the rest of the exhaust like in a normal boiler.  This means you've extracted more energy from burning the fuel than you could have in an ordinary boiler. As a bonus, it also uses the residual heat from the rest of the exhaust pretty well.  Your exhaust coming out of the ordinary boiler might be as hot as 150 degrees C, but the second heat exchanger might allow the temperature to drop to only 40 degrees C.  That's even more heat you've managed to get out of the fuel.

(The extra heat you've extracted means you can get what's called the *higher heating value* out of the fuel, instead of the *lower heating value*.  The difference between these two heat amounts can, depending on what fuel you're using, be as much as 10%!)

(In a steam power plant, they use the same idea to improve efficiency, in a setup called an economizer)"	3	0

e: You know what, I'll just answer for both.

**For hot water**: It doesn't matter.  Your feedwater is always going to be pretty dang cold (rarely above ca 20 deg C), so your condensing boiler is always going to be able to condense the water vapor in the exhaust.

**For home heating**: Basically, when it's really cold outside, and your boiler is working at full capacity, your return water is much hotter than in ""shoulder seasons"".  Your boiler is (probably) designed, at maximum capacity, to be sending 80 deg C water to your radiators, in order to ensure that your home gets sufficient heat to stay comfortable.  The ""problem"" is that the temperature of the water doesn't drop all that much after going through the radiators in your house - maybe 6 to 10 degrees C.  So when your boiler is operating at full capacity, the feedwater going into the boiler is pretty hot already.  In fact, it's so hot that the exhaust gas from the main heat exchanger isn't actually hot enough to condense all the water in the exhaust anymore!  The exhaust gas has to surrender quite a bit of heat to condense the water - and that heat has to go into your feedwater.  But if your feedwater is too hot, the exhaust gas will cool down so much that when even a little bit of water condenses out of the exhaust, the temperature of the exhaust becomes almost exactly the same as the temperature of the feedwater the exhaust is supposed to be heating, meaning that not all the water can be condensed, so you can't get much of an efficiency boost. The absolute worst-case scenario would be if the exhaust were actually cooler than the feedwater - in that case, the feedwater would be heating the exhaust before you vented it, *losing* efficiency instead of gaining it!  For that reason, your system might bypass the condensing section completely when it won't do you any good.

We do know that it's *not urine* and that it's completely normal. It can be a nuisance at times, but it's nothing to be worried about or disgusted by.

Women's bodies are far more variable than men's and thanks to sexual repression the study of the female body is decades behind. Ask her if you can sit in on her next physical and have an open and frank conversation about things with her doctor, it's a good bonding experience, and I'm sure it'll get you a ton of brownie points.

I once had a girlfriend with what felt like a horn inside the middle of her vagina so I did just that, went to the doctor with her, she got examined, told it was rare but perfectly normal, and we just talked about sex and biology for the rest of the meeting. Sex got *a lot* better after that."	24	0

The Skenes Glands (Similar to the male's cowpers gland) are mostly to blame from what I have heard. There is the Cytheria Squirt gun form of squirting, which after asking Mia Rose(before a raid on WoW) is considered to be quite real. and then there is the gush type which is most likely in relation to the bartholins gland (the one that excretes the milky substance.) and involves a filling of the vaginal canal of the woman's natural lubrication and the ejaculation occurs with the contraction of the kegel muscles.

ELI5 version: It isnt pee pee but some think it is cause it has pee pee like things about it. certain girl parts are at fault because of their location in a girls pee hole, this results in a supersoaker like squirt like a few adult stars are known for. Then there is a gushing like squirt that is similar to letting a waterballoon with a bit of water in it deflate this is probably because the girls private bits fill with sticky stuff and her muscles flex pushing it all out.

This was almost a decade ago, but if I remember right it was just how her cervix had grown naturally and wouldn't cause any problems if she decided to have kids or interfere with any normal vaginal uses, and they told her to keep having normal checkups just to be safe.

I guarantee you (most) porn stars making films like these just drink a ton of water beforehand which would dilute the color and fill their bladder to give the appearance of squirting.

It's designed to be a fantasy with a shiny or not so shiny, sexual veneer. However, he's a fairly well known urologist, I don't think he some fly-by-night quack, and he was just reporting on the fluid.  He approached it in a pretty clinical way on the show.  The staffer (Ronnie the limo driver) refused to acknowledge his results. I suspect this is the default response from people who have experienced it (I have not).  It seems to me that it wouldn't be so strange for someone to rationalize that it is not urine due to some sort of social perception.

On a side note, Dr. Fisch's show on Sirius 101 (Wednesday's @ 5:00pm EST) is a fantastic Men's although not exclusively, Health Show. They actually tackle a lot of subjects that men are reluctant do to bring up with their doctors - out of shame, fear or ignorance.  I started listening on the drive home and found myself tuning in every week.  It's humorous, but at the same time, time informative.  The vast majority of the questions are a rough diagnosis with a recommendation to follow up with their doc/specialist.

Women, in my experience, seem to be much more in-tune with their health issues. My wife is far more self-aware of her body than I am of mine and has been going to a gynecologist since her teens.  Men, once again in my experience, are generally dumb asses.  I can survey the 26 guys I work with and if they have a problem or pain, their answer is always ""Meh, it will go away"" or some variation of that. Having that semi-anonymous forum to call up and ask a knowledgable doctor, in this case a urologist,  about problems in the nether region is great.  I love the show.

Simple colors, shapes, and sounds are still new and exciting to them. Their brains are still making connections, and part of this process means they are very good at ""make-believe"" and playing games. They figure out the world by physically interacting with it and everything is new and exciting.

When kids get older, their brains are starting to better understand the world and are less plastic. They have acquired lots and lots of knowledge about how things work and don't have as much use for make-believe and physical exploration of the world. They have also started to grow accustomed to the world, and no longer find simple things like toy blocks as exciting and new. Their bodies start to change and as they go through puberty there is an entirely new world to explore. As they grow into adults they start to value their time more and more, and seeking new experiences grows more difficult but rewarding. New toys or gadgets can still be exciting, and so can more complex versions of toys they had as kids, but an adult has experienced enough that a bunch of wooden blocks just isn't as exciting as it was when they were 6,"	3	0

Advertising doesn't have to instantly cause you to buy a product you wouldn't otherwise get, it just needs you to consider buying a product, and buying it from a specific brand as oppose to other alternatives.

I was kinda like you, got lost from Pokemon after Pearl so all that IV training thing went right over my head. I picked up Emerald again while I saved for X and Y and got into EV training while I was into it. 

Now, IV's are the points you get every time your pokemon levels up. They're those little numbers you see in the level up screen since Pokemon Red and that, if you're anything like me, you never payed much attention to. 

IV training is the practice of defeating certain Pokemon that give specific IV points. So, if you Charizard was supposed to get +2 to every stat when levelling up, now, if you defeat a certain number of that certain pokemon you'll get +2 to every stat and, let's say, +6 to that certain stat you were training. 

As I said, this is done by defeating certain Pokemon. You can find the full lists online. 

Now, you can't breed high IV Pokemon. IV's are only gained by levelling up, and only when levelling up by battling (so no rare candies). You can, however, breed Pokemon with certain natures that give an edge on certain IV's over another (say... A Jolly natured Pokemon that trades, let's say, a low Defense for high Special Defense). The list of natures and their effect you can also find them online. 

Now, if I'm not mistaken, X and Y made gaining IV's easier and included some minigames that help you EV train. But I haven't gotten the games yet so I can't really tell you about that. Sorry. 

Hope this helps. "	2	0

When breeding pokemon, 3 of these stats are randomly passed down from either parent to the baby.  In X/Y, the item Destiny Knot being held by either parent allows 5 of these stats to be passed down. There is a man in the Kiloude City pokemon centre who will tell you what your pokemon's best stats are.  Every pokemon in the friend safari is guaranteed to have at least 2 perfect IVs (31) so these are a good starting point.	3	0

This meant that people had to live very close to where they worked. For lots of people to do that, it was necessary for large numbers of people to live in a small area, generally by making taller buildings with smaller living spaces. That's all high density is: lots of people in a small area.

Things began to change, first with trains and electric streetcars. People could live further from their jobs and commute in, so houses were built further from the city. As automobiles became cheap and common, cities began to be surrounded by more low-density neighborhoods, bigger houses with larger lawns. This happened especially dramatically in the warmer parts of the U.S. with the advent of air conditioning; formerly medium-sized cities like Los Angeles, Atlanta, Dallas, and Houston added many miles of suburbs in a fairly short period of time.

Low density has two big advantages. Living is generally cheap compared to city centers, and people can have lots of room for their money. Unfortunately, low density is not very efficient. Public transportation becomes very difficult to run effectively when only a handful of people can walk to each stop. Cars become necessary for even short trips to the grocery store. (Also, if you want to get drunk at a bar and come home, you need a cab or a sober friend.) Traffic gets very bad very quickly, and no amount of road construction can fix it.

Many cities are trying to increase density, partly because many people have become tired of traffic and long commutes by car, and want to be able to walk to bars and restaurants at night. None of these are very practical in low-density suburbs, but all are pretty easy in higher-density cities."	2	0

Economics are a large part of why high urban density would be important for city planners and politicians. More residences and businesses mean more people and companies feeding tax dollars into the city. It's a double edged sword for some small business owners, because there are more potential customers in the area, but the increase in customer base means that it might make it financially worthwhile for big businesses to invest in the area and open up new locations, driving some smaller companies out of business.

From an administrative standpoint, increased urban density simplifies managing the city's need in many (but not all) ways. Say, for example, that one ambulance runs at 100% of capacity when serving 10,000 people. If the area those 10,000 people occupy shrinks (by the density increasing), the that ambulance's response times should shorten because of the shorter distances it has to travel. There are two benefits here: that same ambulance can now service more people than before, increasing its efficiency, and the shorter response times mean a small uptick in public health. This example works in other sectors too, from police and fire to education and public transport.

The hope in all of this is that as different aspects of the city get better in small amounts across the board, that property values start to rise. This in turn should attract wealthier residents and businesses, which increase tax revenue, and the whole cycle repeats again.

Of course, it can go horribly wrong. Urban sprawl can lead to misallocation of funds, neighborhoods being neglected, and poor minorities being forced to the outskirts of the city because they can't afford to live in the now more affluent and costly city centers. Chicago is a prime example of this. The Loop in downtown and the North Side have excellent public transport accessibility, beaches, world-class museums, phenomenal restaurants, and tons of nightlife. Go 10 minutes south or west of the Loop to where all the minorities have been pushed to and they are areas that you absolutely would not want to be lost in at night. Hell, you don't even want to be there during the day.

**tl;dr** - Urban density is how many people you have packed into an area. The benefit of increasing this is more tax revenue which should lead to an increase in tax revenue and attract wealthier residents and businesses. However, the increase in wealth in one part of the city often displaces poorer minorities that can't afford the increases in living expenses."	2	0

When you purchase a stock from a broker, you don't really own it.  You are what is called the beneficiary, and the stock is actually owned by the broker or the central clearing house or some other entity from in a vast and complex financial cloud.

When you short a stock, you are ""borrowing"" a stock, selling it, then at a later day, ""buying"" it back and returning it.  I use scare quotes, because there isn't usually actual stocks involved.  Since most stocks are technically owned by a clearinghouse, it is simply borrowing stocks from itself, and writing itself an IOU.  And brokers just assume the clearing house will be able to do this, and credit your account accordingly.

That's a regular short.  A naked short is when there are more shorts out there then stocks that can be lent.  It can be hard to tell whether a particular short is naked or not, because shorts don't have to be settled immediately, and that also means there is really no limit to how many shorts can be out there.  There is concern that the ability to have naked, and thus an unlimited number of short sales allows unscrupulous institutions to manipulate the market."	0	0

There will never be any Apple shares in your name, unless you go through a lot of trouble and expense to have certificates sent to you.

But your broker is legally obligated by federal regulations to afford to your all the privileges and obligations of an Apple shareholder.  Eventually your purchase will get settled in some way, and there likely will be a specific share assigned to you.

Early electronic scales in bathrooms got a lot of customer complaints, because they did not give repeatable results. You could weigh yourself several times, and get a different reading each time. So the manufacturers put in a ""fix"". They had the scale remember its last couple of readings, and if a new one came along that was close to one in memory, it just displayed the one in memory (instead of the new reading). Problem solved!  
  
Of course, this is a cheat. It didn't really solve the repeatability problem, it just hid it.    
  
My guess is that this could be causing your issue. You step on the scale, and the reading isn't quite close enough to a previous one, so it displays the new reading.  The problem is that the old reading was bogus.  
  
Or, as other people have mentioned, if the scale is not on a level surface it can give varying results.  And the intrinsic accuracy of a bathroom scale is usually on the order of a pound or so, unless it is a balance beam type. "	2	0

Part of the concern these days is not simply a nuclear strike by conventional military means like missiles. Some of the concern lies in that these ""rogue"" states might resort to sneak attacks via small concealed nuclear/""dirty bombs"" smuggled into and detonated in populated areas. Or that control over nuclear material is too lax in some of these countries and that nuclear material may fall into the hands of terrorist organizations that wish to make a big statement. Or concerns include that the government will intentionally supply a terrorist organization with nuclear materials in order to strike another country but still be able to claim innocence. 

The problem of nuclear radiation fallout poses a much wider problem than the range of blast damage. Consider Chernobyl - when the reactor exploded it became a ""dirty bomb"". Relative to conventional nuclear weapons not much physical damage resulted from the explosion, but use of the area has been all but totally denied due to radiation contamination. It has been nearly 28 years since the accident and access to the area is still restricted and regulated. Even though you can visit the area you have to limit the time you spend there because of radiation exposure limits, and you need to watch where you go within the area by monitoring radiation levels with a Geiger counter. Now imagine key cities for a country being attacked, key political centers, materials resources, or key food/water supplies. Contaminate an area and you can deny access, or at best make it very challenging to use the area. Nuclear radiation contamination is a beeotch. "	2	0

I hear a lot of stories from medical professionals of illegal immigrants, or just immigrants for that matter coming over, working a few days then claiming an injury so they'll now be in workers comp, so there are a few leeches, that drives up cost a bit.  Thirdly, big pharmaceutical companies have a stronghold on how the industry runs as a whole, they're not exactly scrupulous, they're here to make money so charging out the ass for their products is commonplace.

Insurance companies reacted by lowering percentage of reimbursement, and doctors raised prices, until you have our current situation where if you don't have insurance you get hit by the artificially raised ""market rates"" that are necessary to get insurance companies to compensate appropriately. The problem is these cost have become incredibly unbalanced leading to insane charges like $30 for a single dose of tylenol and the high cost of decent health insurance. 

Thus many people are choosing to forgo expensive health insurance, particularly the young and healthy whose  premiums and low rates of claims, help pay for the sick and old people who will be making more claims that exceeds their premiums. Since the remaining people on insurance has a higher rate of people making claims, the insurance company makes less money and thus raises premiums to compensate. As rates increase, fewer people get insurance until they need it and the rate of claims goes up and the cycle continues. 

That is why in my opinion a government or public option for healthcare is beneficial to both us as individuals and for the system to run more efficiently. By forcing people to have health insurance, something only the government can really do, everybody pays into the system and when everyone participates it's easier to balance the cost of treatment for the sick and the premiums of the healthy. I believe that the government would also do a better job at maintaining a leaner system as opposed to a private company which is motivated a little bit more by increased profits. So in theory we get cheaper, better coverage and the system has enough flexibility to accommodate variation. 

It is important to point out that this entirely suppositional, and is the result of a systemic feedback problem in how prices and reimbursement are determined, impacting the market. Not because there is some conspiracy to make healthcare expensive. This is simple economics.

You can't go to the doctor without receiving a list of tests you need to have and specialists you should visit and the costs escalate, most of the time NOT in direct porportion to the ailment you were trying to cure.  If you have a complaint, you need an MRI.  These are costly (and btw I understand much less so in Europe).

America doesn't really have any such mechanism.

2) Countries that have single payer health insurance (Canada, New Zealand, UK, Scandinavia, etc) have a LOT of market power.  Basically, the national/state health insurance can tell a hospital, ""hey, you're gonna do MRIs for $400, or else we're not gonna pay you to do it.""  It works, because if the single payer doesn't pay for those services, there is no one else to buy that service.  The hospital still wants to make money from MRIs, so they agree.   Otherwise, the hospital down the road is going to get all the MRI revenue (at $400 / visit), instead.  Medicare in US enjoys the same benefit, and you might have heard about how medicare pays dimes to dollar for medical services rendered.  This is because Medicare is such a HUGE buyer, hospitals cannot ignore them.

3) America is one of the only countries that allow insurance companies to run a profit.  Other countries with private health insurance like Japan, Germany of Switzerland either ban profits for insurance companies, or only allow profits on luxury care (for better hospital rooms, but not for heart surgery or clinical visits).  This means, even if US hospitals and doctors were forced to reduce their costs, it will still cost patients a lot in US.  While the insurance companies will fight to reduce the cost from providers (again, hospitals, clinics, etc), they will also fight to get the maximum premium (and pay the least proportion in a medical situation, as in high deductibles and coinsurance) from the patient (to maximize profit).

These things together make America's health insurance system not a system for healing the most people, but a system where the strongest can make the most money.  This may be the hospital in some areas, or the insurance companies in others, but there isn't really any mechanism to protect the patient from high costs.

**Edit:** I would recommend watching ""Sick Around America"" and ""Sick Around the World"", both Frontline documentaries, available for free on the PBS website.  They're only about 1 hour each, and quite interesting.  They're a bit dated (about 5 or 6 years now?), but still pretty applicable.  And, cheers to you for looking into this stuff, mate. =)

**Edit2:** There is another concept, that would take a while to explain, and that is the dual responsibility of universal coverage, and universal mandate.  The first says that the country (privately or through government organizations) will provide health security to ALL of its citizens and residents.  The second says that to pay for this universal coverage, all citizens and residents MUST buy health insurance (either privately or by paying taxes).  This basically pools everyone's risk together.  America is hitting some moral roadblocks on this for two reasons.  One, many people are saying, ""Hey, you can't FORCE me to buy insurance!  I think I'm healthy and *I* don't need it.""  Secondly, many people are saying, ""Why should my salary be docked for the peace of mine of someone else?  With all due respect, someone else's health security is not my concern.""  It's definitely a social value thing.  I lived in US (and am a citizen), and live in NZ now.  Over here, everyone just believes everyone deserves medical coverage, like public education, or fire protection.  I can't really say the same for US, and until American people universally agree that it's a common good to have universal coverage and mandate, US health insurance isn't likely to change much (I think, anyway).  I think ACA does a lot to address a lot of the concerns above (but not enough, imo), but even that, as you know, is getting a lot of pushback, both from politicians and from everyday folks."	1	0

* Health care in the U.S. isn't a right, it's a privilege.
* Insurance companies partake in anti-competitive behavior which includes:

** Underpaying the actual cost of care to care providers who then

*** Over charge those without insurance

** Negotiating deals with health care providers that other health care providers can't compete with.

To top it off, we have a political system that constantly barrages our citizens with messages stating that if health care were to become a right then health care for everybody would suffer."	0	0

If this water is absorbed by the plants on the sides of road, then the salinity of the water outside of the plants cells increases, messing up the homeostasis of the plant. This causes water from inside the cells of the plant to travel through the membrane in order to retain equilibrium, which can cause the plant to wilt and/or die. Hope this helps	3	0

To use the all-powerful car analogy, in the 30s Rolls Royce made cars with 7 liter engines that produced 115 horsepower. Nowadays we have cars with 1.8 liter engines that can produce 200+ horsepower. 

The core thing is a bit different. The reason Intel CPUs are considered superior to AMD CPUs is because most applications can not utilize multiple cores, which means it all comes down to how much work a single core on an Intel chip can do vs how much a single core on an AMD chip can do. Intel CPUs beat AMD CPUs handily in single core environments, but the competition becomes stiffer when CPUs like the AMD 8350 can utilize all 8 physical cores, something you see in situations such as video encoding.

It may seem odd, but the US was very much realistically contemplating -yes really- a first strike against the soviets and Chinese, simply because of how insanely successful a first strike is. The Russians had similar ideas. The Chinese are a wild card.

Since it was well known to the Greeks how to figure out the area/perimeter of a normal polygon, you could set upper and lower limits to the area/circumference of the circle used. As the number of sides of the inscribed/circumscribed shapes kept increasing the upper and lower limits kept getting closer together, eventually becoming the same to a significant figure, which was the approximation of pi.

With the advent of calculus, convergent series (like Leibniz's Formula for pi) could be used, but many of them converged very slowly and took many terms to get an accurate approximation.

Nowadays, there are many ways to calculate pi because of the proliferation of mathematics. However, because we keep looking for more and more digits, most methods use computer algorithms that converge quickly."	2	0

To get more accurate, a guy names David Bailey created an algorithm to find out any digit of pi you want, but it will only get that one digit. So you can keep using that algorithm on each digit.

You look at the failing company and look at the valuation of what it *does* have and pick that up for a song and a dance. The failing company takes what it can get since its on its way out anyways.

The successful company can buoy the failing company while it takes what it needs. The failing company is cleaned up, streamlined, and either placed back into service in some way, shape, or form, or is liquidated entirely for its assets and its copyrights/trademarks become a re-direct to the parent.

For example; Circuit City went to the kaput. Eventually it was bought out, and now going to circuitcity.com takes you to TigerDirect - so in the beginning, all of those circuitcity customers were now going to TigerDirect, which is a revenue increase to balance out the cost of acquiring the now dead company.

No. A ""hostile takeover"" is a generic term used to describe an acquisition of a company against the will of the board of directors (and often many of the shareholders as well). There's no one form that a hostile takeover can take."	3	0

A $1000 bond might sell for $200 or less (while a savvy investor can spot the firms with assets that are worth perhaps $500).  Banks and other firms are regulated and their regulators generally don't want them to hold on to too much bad debt, so they frequently have to sell at times when no one else wants bad debt.  	1	0

Hostile takeovers can happen in any of the above scenarios and also to companies that are not bankrupt at all.   They happen when a publicly-traded company (one who sells stock on the NASDAQ or NYSE stock exchanges in the US or various others worldwide) has more than 50% of their stocks purchased by another company or entity, against the will of the current person or persons currently running it.   

Which is a slightly awkward way of putting it so I'll use an example:  Say you were able to purchase 50.1% of the available shares of Microsoft's stock, you could then win any vote among the stockholders and force out the current board of directors including Bill Gates himself.  You might do this by offering to purchase shares substantially above their current market value, or you might do it by just quietly purchasing them and hope that nobody notices.  (the former scenario is far more common)  This would be a **hostile takeover bid**  In reality this would be extremely expensive and very difficult since Bill Gates and his supporters would notice what you were doing and make sure that at least 50.1% of the shares were owned by people who would refuse to sell them to you."	2	0

This is because often when speaking to someone like a head of state, you aren't actually showing respect for them as you are for the office that they inhabit. You are showing respect for the system by respecting the person.

The question you are asking is part of a larger question which has more to do with the nature of social psychology.  There are many things people do across societies which are not considered 'natural', but 'socially constructed' -- that is, things which we do as a result of being socialized within a certain region, time, culture, etc...  Take for example the act of greeting someone: in one culture, we may bow to one another; in another culture we may shake hands.  Both of these acts are significantly different while the gestures signify the same thing.  The act of bowing or shaking hands is a social construction because different societies have signified different actions to represent customary ways of greeting one another.  We uphold these customs with one another because we have been brought up to understand that these are the ways in which we are to act with one another.  The same thing goes for your question. 

Addressing someone as 'Sir' or 'Madam' acknowledges that you observe this person to be above you in the social hierarchy.  More importantly, you (and I) have been taught that addressing our superiors in this way is an acknowledgement of their status in society.    
As for addressing the president as 'Barack', you would likely experience a great deal of cognitive dissonance in doing so because this contradicts the very systems of social organization that you (and we) have been taught to uphold since we were born.  In other words, you have been told that addressing the president as Barack, rather than President Obama, is something that we customarily do not do.  You would feel unsettled about this because of your socialization, and so you correct for this by addressing the president as 'Mr. President'.

Keep in mind, your question is HUGE, and thousands of books have been written on the subject.  The very nature of social science is to untangle the complex systems and societies that humans have created.  I would invite you and others to explore the other possible answers to this question!"	4	0

There are three talents to being a top songwriting star:
* A naturally good singing voice, performance skills
* Being charismatic/sexy/hot

People who have all three are called, in the industry, ""triple threats"". However they are exceedingly rare. There are, for instance, amazing songwriters who are 50 year-old pot bellied men who you wouldn't look twice at in the grocery store around LA.

The music industry has *always* matched songwriters to performers. All that singing competition shows do is publicize the process, adding fake drama on top of it. But if you listen closely, you'll notice that none of the performers *ever* perform their own songs.

The winner of these contests are given a contract, and get to perform original songs written by others. All of Kelly Clarkson's hits aren't hers, for instance. She has not a drop of musicianship or songwriting talent. She just sings what she's given.

However, there aren't so many good songs out there for runners-up to start performing with. So if they want to try to make a career afterwards, they need to actually write their own songs, and that's a rare talent indeed.

The world is full of pretty people with good voices. What it doesn't have much of are people who know how to structure a song that actually **says something** to a modern audience. (And yes, even pop-songs do have meanings behind them, usually illustrating and capturing common sorts of relationship issues.)

Depending on whether you were in shadow or light and how far from the sun you were, you could either die of hypothermia as your space suit slowly radiated away heat that was not replaced, overheating as you basked in light and absorbed heat faster than you could lose it, or by irradiation due to solar flares or suchlike. Another possibility would be (similar to Gravity) impact by some sort of debris, be it space junk or small meteorites that caused a hole in the space suit or just killed you outright.

The speed at which you traveled would depend entirely on the speed at which you pushed off from whatever took you up into space. Assuming you pushed off at 5 meters per second, you'd be travelling at whatever speed the thing you pushed off from was travelling, plus 5 meters per second. If the thing you pushed off from was in orbit around the earth, you'd also be in orbit. If it was en route from the earth to the moon, so would you. It's pretty difficult to meaningfully alter your course in space, since everything is so far away. There's a reason people use big-ass rockets to alter their courses :P"	3	0

Since space is a vacuum, there are very few particles in it to carry energy and so conventional ideas of temperature don't really work. However, the famous cosmic microwave background radiation, which pervades the entire universe and is (pretty much) uniform has a profile that you would associate with something at a temperature of about 2.7 Kelvin; that is, 2.7 degrees C above absolute zero, or -270.3^o C.

The physical aspects that contribute to a natural born talent would be: 

The shape/geometry of the throat, nose, mouse and teeth and control of the diaphragm and breathing plays a huge role in the quality of a singing voice. 

Another important and often neglected aspect of someone being a good singer, is their innate ability to know their range and stick within it. Consider if you will that the voice like any other instrument works similarly for everyone but each such instrument has it's own merits and qualities. Someone who is intimately familiar with their own voice is far more apt to sing well. As such, it seems that having a particularly good memory may be a physical neurologically based trait that favors singers.

This is more likely to happen when there is another injury that's distracting, or when someone is intoxicated. The broken vertebrae (neck bones) will be unstable, so movement of the neck can dislodge them and cause injury resulting in paralysis. This is why people who have been in a car accident or have had a head injury are urged not to move their necks until they can be assessed for neck injury, and why cervical collars are often used as a precaution.	2	0

* A is an antigen
* B is an antigen
* O is no antigen. 
* Receiving an antigen that you do not already have in your blood type is dangerous 

A blood type receivers can receive from another A donor, but can never receive a B antigen. So they cannot receive from a B or an AB donor, who both have the B antigen. O has no antigen so they can receive from O. 

Same goes for B, they can never receive an A antigen. So they can receive from another B, or an O, but never from an A or an AB. 

AB can receive from both A, B, AB and O, as they already have both A and B antigens in their blood type. That makes AB blood type the universal RECEIVER. 

O blood type cannot receive from anyone but another O blood type, as they do not already possess any A or B antigens.

That means everyone can RECEIVE from an O donor without getting any adverse reaction from antigens. O is then the universal donor.

Almost forgot the explaining the bubble part. A bubble is defined as a period of growth which is somehow artificial, or not backed by real growth in terms of production. Like a bubble eventually such a system can't sustain itself and it collapses and then things get really messed up.

For example, in the 90's in the united states, it was very easy to get credit, this led to a bubble, people and institutions spending more than they actually had because of all the credit.

When things are exchanged for ""values"", if the trade values are universal enough, then they can be traded both ways with little or no change in values.  That is, if you traded with your friend thing A for thing B, if that trade was fair in value, then you would expect that tomorrow you can trade thing B for thing A.

However, in reality, many things are not universal in value, so to stabilize their value, governments or banks ""back""/guarantee the values.

For example, paper currencies are basically just paper/cloth, they are fundamentally worthless, except when backed by governments for their values.

However, many things are not backed in value.  Such as real estate (in most countries).

When such non-guaranteed things are traded, sometimes the values rise beyond initial traded values over multiple trades.  

This may be due to speculations, which increases demand for the thing artificially (which increases the perceived value), which leads inevitably to oversupply and a rapid decline of value.

This cycle is referred to as a ""bubble"", which largely arises because of the speculative increase in demand for the thing, and a subsequent oversupply to meet the increase in demand.

What China's property market has is more an ""inflation"", not necessarily a ""bubble"".

(Talk about another term that's difficult to distinguish and define).

Greater Growth often leads to ""inflation"", which sees a general rise of prices for some things.

Simple example:  If a large city is booming and growing, prices of things (rent, property, food) tend to rise, which would be inflation of prices.  But this is not necessarily due to speculation.  Instead, this is dominated by ACTUAL demand.

When some ""experts"" talk about China's ""property bubble"", they tend to use disjointed data in a way that makes no sense.

""Bubble"" generally has (1) oversupply, and (2) high prices, within a same geo region.

But for China's ""property bubble"", ""experts"" point to (1) oversupply in ""ghost towns"", and (2) high prices of non-Ghost towns (like in Shanghai).

In effect, the ""experts"" are talking ""Apples and Oranges"".

In US's ""housing bubble"", one see oversupply and speculatively high prices in the same bubble locations (Stockton California, for example).

This alignment eventually leads to the bubble popping.

But in China, there is no such alignment.  Ghost-towns are oversupplied, but they are not even sold to the public (no high prices).  High priced Chinese cities still have high occupancy rate and high rental prices (not affected by oversupply of ghost-towns).

So, in China, it's more an ""inflation"" than a ""bubble"".

Hamas is a much more militant group, and labeled a terrorist organization by much if the western world.

Fatah used to represent all of Palestine, but Hammas won Gaza Strip elections in '06.  The divide hasn't been good for Palestinian statehood.

Abbas took it to the UN a little while back, but since hasn't really done a lot and is perceived as somewhat weak.  Israel is slowly encroaching in on the West Bank with settlement expansions, but the peace and foreign investment has been good (or at least better) for them.

The West Bank has taken a militant approach resulting in bombardments back and forth and drastically reduced quality of life for Gaza residents.

Obama has a somewhat icy relationship with the Israeli PM.  He's perceived as being a bit more balanced about it than previous American presidents, but it's somewhat moot at the moment as the Palestinians have less coherent leadership and the Israelis have no reason to believe in land-for-peace or acceptance by their neighbors.

Better cooperation between Fatah and Hammas may correct the Palestinian leadership problem, but it'll take time before it changes the above.

The 'right to return'  thing is a non-starter for negotiating with Israel, and they're skeptical about sovereignty/land for statehood claims from Palestine - as granting the territories more self governance and autonomy only resulted in more violence.   "	2	0

Fatah - currently the group holding power in the West Bank.  Fatah has recognized Israel's right to exist.  Fatah has accepted the Oslo Accords which call for a two-state solution to the conflict.

Hamas - currently the group holding power in the Gaza Strip.  Does not recognize Israel's right to exist.  Has not accepted the Oslo Accords.

Hamas won the only election the Palestinians have ever conducted.  Fatah refused to acknowledge that result.  In the Gaza Strip Hamas was powerful enough to kill and/or exile Fatah party leadership and security forces and take control of the area.  In the West Bank, Fatah was powerful enough to kill and/or exile Hamas leaders, and negate the results of the election.

The partnership is one step of many that are necessary to unify the Palestinian authorities under one government.  It is an inevitable part of the process, assuming that Gaza and the West Bank are going to eventually be one country (which is not necessarily a fait accompli, see Bangladesh and Pakistan for an example of the reverse outcome).

Israel doesn't like it because they like having Hamas as a security threat they can use to justify a lot of their reactionary policies towards the Palestinians.  If Hamas and Fatah merge then Israel can't play ""good cop / bad cop"" with the two halves of the Palestinian state.

It won't affect America's foreign policy at all.  Nothing will affect America's foreign policies except the utter destruction of Israel.  Until then, US foreign policy is to hope that a miracle occurs and that the Israelis and Palestinians agree to have two side-by-side countries with a negotiated border that don't regularly attack each other and that the Arabs don't use as a staging ground to prepare to destroy Israel and drive the Jews into the sea."	1	0

In areas that have a high risk of flooding, the houses are built so they can be emptied before a flood, and  hosed out and repainted afterward. In hurricane zones, homes are built to higher building standards that will survive all but the most extreme storm. But at a certain point, the cost to build the building any stronger, balanced with the inconvenience of living in a house built like a bomb shelter, outweighs the risk of damage to the house in an extreme weather event. Beyond this point, there's insurance.

The main issue is cost-to-benefit. You pay a lot of money for features that aren't really used, and end up with an unappealing-looking house. All of these natural disasters are common, but experiencing the actual part of these disasters that causes the house-destroying level of damage is not.

&gt;This also applies to tornado alley. Domes consistently survive events like this.

So do regular houses. Tornados don't cause extensive damage *unless they hit you directly,* and it is statistically quite rare to have your own house destroyed by one.

&gt;Underground housing is also an option. It's less affordable apples to apples, but for the same price as your traditional house you can settle for a smaller underground one...

Most people don't want to ""settle,"" they want a larger house, and if they have the means to do so (and the insurance to replace it if need be), then they're all set.

&gt;...and not have to buy a replacement every few years.

This. Fucking. Statement. This is my *biggest* issue with people who ask this question, because the conception is that we midwesterners are consistently dodging tornados and having to rebuild after them. We're not.

I have lived in Tornado Alley (Kansas and Nebraska specifically) for almost 25 years now, and *I have only ever seen one tornado*. My experience is not an irregular one. These events do happen, of course, but unless you get hit by one directly, you will walk away unscathed. You are much more likely to be killed by the severe thunderstorm that spawned the tornado, rather than the tornado itself. Building to extreme codes (except in the case of municipal and emergency buildings, that *must* be relied upon to survive such events) is just not cost-effective.

On the more severe end though, a direct hit by an EF5 will obliterate anything you put in front of it, short of heavily reinforced concrete (which is beyond the means of the average person).

&gt;And in flood prone areas, why not simply buy a houseboat but place it on land? Those who are capable of affording them, obviously. And I don't mean tsunamis, I mean floods like the one that coincided with Katrina. There is of course not much you can do in the event of a tsunami.

Two words: Flood Insurance. It's considerably more appealing for people who don't want to live on boat they can't even use, as they safe and can replace their old homes in the rare event that they actually experience a flood and aren't prepared enough before hand to evacuate.

&gt;If it's a small home I'm sure it's simply cheaper to rebuild, but in areas where this happens regularly you think there'd be a demand for novel types of housing that can reliably survive those disasters.

And yet there isn't. Not because these events don't happen, but because they *don't destroy houses on a regular basis in the same areas*."	3	0

In other words, the school needs to make at least 2% per year on their endowment in order to cover tuition for 10,000 students. They also need to make enough to cover any rising costs, incidentals (building repair and upkeep, etc.), and other increases (e.g. inflation).

For perspective, the stock market returns an average of 11% per year, and inflation averages about 2% per year.

So, to cover both tuition and provide for inflation, the endowment needs to make only 4% per year! In short, the Harvard endowment, if all of its proceeds were available to spend on student tuition, they are essentially guaranteed to make enough to pay for all their students' tuitions indefinitely.

Practically speaking, endowments are really a huge basket of smaller funds that people donate, and that are earmarked for certain projects (I want my money to go to the football team! Or the sciences! Or whatever) so they aren't free to spend it however they want. It has to go towards certain selected purposes."	6	0

Angle = 55 degrees

Hypotenuse (distance from porch to top of the tree) = ?

People find something they enjoy and practice that ability till they good at it. That being said, mathematics is a big field and I don't think most people are good or bad at all aspects of it. For example, I am good with calculus. It is very easy for me to imagine shapes and lines and it is easy for me to see what will happen to them when you transform them in some way. My skill does not help me when I have to calculate how much money I should leave if I want to tip 15% on a $25 restaurant bill. Yes I know the ""trick"" about dividing by 10 (ie. 2.5) and dividing that by 2 (ie. 1.25) and adding the three numbers (ie. 25+2.5+1.25 = 28.75) but even doing this simple math is difficult for me to do in my head because all I see are lines that are useless unless I'm estimating. 

TLDR: Some people are good at math while others aren't because everybody can't be good at everything. And even those that are ""good at math"" probably aren't good at all of math."	1	0

A lot of the problem is that math is explained as rules versus concepts. People generally don't learn the *why* about the math. 

For instance, the reason we can use Tangent to find out the height of the tree is because the three angles and the three sides of a triangle all relate. The tree makes up one side of the triangle, the distance to the base of the tree makes up another, and the distance to the top is the other side. We know that all angles of a triangle have to add up to 180^o and we know that the angle between the line representing the distance to the ground and the line representing the distance to the top is a 55^o angle. Based on this angle, we can make the assumption that the tree is a 90^o angle (although it might not be most math problems assume a straight line within the tree and not the tree as a line per se) and figure the other to be 35^o if we are looking for angles. 

We can deduce other elements like Sine, Cosine, and Tangent, which is a way to relate the sides to the angles. Quick lesson:

Opposite (O) = opposite the angle known

Adjacent (A) = next to the angle

Hypotenuse (H) = longest side

**then you can apply the SOHCAHTOA method to remember the formulas**

Sin = O/H    (SOH)

Cos = A/H    (CAH)

Tangent = O/A    (TOA)

In the example we need to find the opposite and we know the adjacent. Since those two variables are only used for Tangent, we know we are looking for that. 

So we insert the numbers in the following arrangement:

Formula (angle) = Formula

*Tan (55) = Opposite/Adjacent*

*tan(55) = X/45*

(because  we know the angle of 55^o the tangent function will derive a variable that works to find here the opposite side, but the distance from it is lending that what we get will only be 1/45 of it)

So when we get ""1.428148006742114"" by putting 55 in the calculator and pressing TAN, we are getting a 1/45 ratio of that opposite side and thus we have to multiply by that 45 to get to a solid 45/45, which is the same as 1/1 in ratio and that's what we need. 

Tangent function is a function for an angle to the opposite and adjacent sides. Sine is a function for an angle to the opposite and hypotenuse sides. Cosine is a function for an angle to the adjacent and hypotenuse sides.  Set angles have set functions or ratios for them. For instance, the given SIN, COS, or TAN for a given 55^o can remain static, because the measurement of the triangle will give you the remaining information. The side that you know will tell you the rest of how that static input applies. "	1	0

*A fish has a head that is 9"" long, a body that is the length of the head plus the tail, and a tail that is the length of the head plus one half the length of the body. How long is the fish?*

Here is why people don't understand. They are trying to solve two problems at the same time and they don't understand WHY they are doing the math. What we are imagining here are concepts of relations. We have two unknowns, so we need to solve one first. 

In this case we have three statements about three parts. Let's label the parts body (b) head (h) and tail (t) for ease. 

So we know the head is 9""

H=9

We know the body is the head plus the tail

B = H + T

And we know the tail is the head plus half the body

T = H + 1/2B

So we end up with the three

H=9

B= H+T

T = H + 1/2 B

First, we should try to not put all of the numbers in and just simplify so we aren't confused. Let's insert T into the B equation. What I mean is, since I know what T is equal to, I can insert that into the B equation with parentheses to mean essentially I'm inserting the whole thing. This gives me

B = H + (H+ 1/2 B) 

No problem. Since we cannot do more with parentheses, we are good and can remove

B = H + H + 1/2 B which we can narrow down to B = 2H + 1/2 B

Now we can get rid of that pesky B on the side with the H's, but since the = is basically a scale and it needs to balance, we also need to take 1/2 b off of the other side

This means we get

1/2b = 2H

No problem because that means we can just double it up for what B is (in this case what we are doing is multiplying by 2 on both sides to keep the scales even again)

So B = 4H

well we know that H=9, so 9 ^x 4 = 36

B = 36

We now know the following

H = 9

B = 36

T = H + 1/2 B

So solve T

T= 9 + 1/2(36)

Half of 36 is 18 so

T= 9 + 18

T= 27

So we now know all the lengths

H=9

B=36

T=27

We we can just add them. 9 + 36 + 27 = 72

So the fish is 72 inches.

**BACK TO THE OP**

The problem is that a lot of people lack the abstract thinking ability to separate this problem into variables and they just see it as a single question. It's really asking you to find a few things and then asking you to add them, but it's not a surface level question so when you don't understand that concept you will be stuck trying to plug numbers into the problem and hoping for a good answer rather than actually solving the problem.

You take the 2.5 + 1.25 and get 3.75 first

Set that money aside and then get the 25 for your bill. 

You're still doing the math in your head, but it's a cheaters way to avoid the extra math. 

It's easier than saying, okay I need 0.15 of 25, and it turns out to be 3.75

**The better trick is to think like this:**

We know that %'s run equal. In your question 15% of $25 = 25% of $15

Well it's a heck of a lot easier to know the 25% so let's do that. 

25% of 15 you can surmise quickly to be 3.75. If not, then do half of 15 as 7.5 and half of that as 3.75. That can work better than the other trick. 

Any time you want a % and you have a number that is easier for % just flip the numbers. It's easier. 

74% of 50? forget that mess

How about 50% of 74? Sure...37...well that's the same

So 74% of 50 is also the same 37...

Usually they start by eating larges amounts of food to loosen the belly (usually they eat a lot of lettuce) They never stop eating the days before the competition they might even have a good meal hours before the competition. Second you must control your gag reflexes which is no easy thing to do, once mastered is much more easier for you to swallow. But winning requires tricks, Drinking only water (soda tend to fill you faster), moving your lower body helps you to stop feeling full, separating the food helps to go for the easy swallowing parts, don't waste time chewing and remember every bite you take wash it down with liquid so you don't choke.

That's where the real fights for money are happening, but that's not where people are going to feel the real problem.  The issue is that this makes it much harder (unreasonably so) to create new Internet based business strategies.  This makes it much more expensive to create the next Google, or Facebook, or Netflix.  The down sides won't be clearly obvious, because you can't point at companies that have never been started.  Data driven industry will stagnate, and most people will be scratch their heads, confused as to why.  I'm telling you ahead of time: this is why.

&gt;Right now, they can't charge Netflix anything, and so either pass the cost on to the consumer in their internet bill, or just eat the loss.

Woah, woah, woah!  That's about as wrong as it gets on this topic!  The ISP is being paid for that.  They're being paid by their customer.  Netflix (for example) has their own ISP that they too are already paying!  So-called ""fast lanes"" are a mechanism to charge *another ISP's customer* for data that their own customers have requested.  Netflix isn't happy about this because they're getting double billed.

It isn't a loss.  It's the cable co taking ""profits"" off the top instead of reinvesting in equipment, and then calling it a loss when their customers demand that the service keeps up with the times.

There were also cable and internet providers separate from the content providers. They just took what was available, and fed it to your house.

Thanks to mergers and acquisitions over the years, all the different content providers (for television at least) have merged together and they also merged with the cable service companies. Now they are producing the content AND feeding it to your house. This turns into a big conflict of interest, because of course they would rather you buy only the content that they produce.

So now you have Comcast preferring to only feed you NBC and Universal content (though they would be willing to also feed you Time Warner content since they are a cooperative cartel), but exclude content from any new emerging content providers such as Netflix. This is what is killing the neutrality of the internet (and of cable television).

So even if you legislate Net Neutrality, there's still a risk that the cable service providers will sneakily throttle content from other companies. Yes they are not supposed to peek at the data that goes back and forth, but they don't have to. They know what data they are providing themselves, so all they have to do is throttle everything else. There was already a huge previous outrage when they tried to throttle torrents, but now they are trying to do it legally by simply changing the law, because they've slowly worked their way in a position to do so, through lobbying, and through the appointment of industry insiders to the government positions that regulate such behaviour.

I think the only real solution, that should have been done much earlier on, is to separate the content providers from the service providers. That way, nobody would be allowed to push their own product."	2	0

Right now there's already holes in the net neutrality wall. The cable companies also provide cell phone service (especially in Canada).

As for *how* it decides to follow that graph, nowadays there are computers involved of course. But traditionally it was all done with hydraulics; pumps and valves and stuff. [HowStuffWorks](http://auto.howstuffworks.com/automatic-transmission13.htm) has a pretty good picture of a simple version, where the faster the drive shaft turns, the more pressure there is from that; and the more throttle the driver uses, the more pressure comes from that; and a valve ""decides"" among the pressures whether to trigger a shift or not.

Later computers were programmed via [punched cards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_cards). Literal holes were punched in stiff card using a special hole puncher; the pattern of holes represented program instructions, and these cards were then read by the machine and the corresponding instructions executed.

The invention of the [Von Neumann architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture) is what first allowed programs to be stored in memory alongside data. At first, programs had to be carefully crafted in machine language using something like binary notation.

From there, assembly language notation was invented, then higher level programming languages, and the rest is history."	17	0

Atomic ""orbitals"" are the regions of space around an atom that have high electron density.  Basically, they're the places that electrons tend to be.

In a single carbon atom there are four valence (exterior) electron orbitals, one spherical ""s"" orbital and three dumbbell shaped ""p"" orbitals that lie along the x, y, and z axis.

In diamond the three p orbitals and the s orbital have merged to create four identical orbitals in a tetrahedral arrangement.  All four of these are filled in the diamond bound state.

In graphite only two of the p orbitals merge with the s orbital to make three bonding orbitals 120 degrees in a triangle shape.

The third p orbital is not included in the carbon-carbon bonding, but it is still present and occupied by electrons.  That gives you four valence orbitals just like diamond.

Thats more like ELI15, but that's as simple as it gets."	2	0

A final electron though, moves perpendicular to this plane for each carbon atom. This can form a bond to carbons above or below the plane, like in diamond (this changes the plane's shape though), or it can bond with electrons across the plane.

This forms a double bond, since it adds to single bonds already there. The electron moves back and forth between the two carbons. But all carbons here are chemically identical, no neighbouring atom takes precedence. The double bond is established and broken, and established elsewhere rapidly. The spare electrons will constantly move between atoms, they're de-localised. The double bonds in the plane are averaged out until all bonds are essentially 1.333... bonds. The spare electrons are free to move throughout the plane, which is why graphite conducts electricity so well.

At any given time, each carbon essentially has two single bonds and a double bond, but this double bond's location is always changing."	1	0

Expanding the size of the tire performs a similar alteration as the gearing; a larger tire travels a greater distance per revolution, therefore the motive power is more spread out.

when you cry it is also a obvious outward sign communicating that you are sad, and humans have evolved to react to this and come and help you and make you feel better.

The first is what's seen by those inside the spaceship. The second being what's seen by someone outside the spaceship and stationary relative to it. One of the two postulates(assumptions) of Special Relativity is that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant regardless of your relative velocity.

So let's look at the first condition. Inside the spaceship, the headlights aren't moving(relative to you inside) so everything looks normal. The speed of light is c, and you measure some wavelength(color) for the light.

The second condition is where things get interesting. Outside the spaceship, you also measure the speed of light as being c. Remember, one of the fundamental keys to Relativity is that the speed of light is constant to everyone. 

Now, I mentioned the wavelength of the light in the first condition. This is important because as it turns out, the wavelength measured outside the spaceship is actually different. Depending on whether or not the spaceship is moving towards or away from you, the light will either be blue or red shifted. This is known as relativistic doppler shift. 

The reasons behind this have to do with some other effects of Relativity which are time dilation(moving clocks tick slower) and length contraction( objects get shorter along their direction of motion).

In the beginning there was light. I'm not kidding here and this isn't religious. Before the universe as we know it, all there was, were photons. Now photons don't experience time so there was no time. You also can't have space when all you have are photons because they are bosons which can occupy the same state.  So, no time, no space, just an electromagnetic field. Then something happened (dunno what) that caused some photons to transform into matter (e=mc2 stuff). Now we have stuff that isn't photons and travels slower than photons. Because we now have things travelling at different rates, we get time. Because we now have fermions, we need space. All of this happening everywhere at the same time. That's your Big Bang moment. Space and time being emergent phenomena out of the necessity to accommodate stuff that isn't photons. 	0	0

Before the Big ""Bang"" SPACE ITSELF was not as expansive as it is now. All of the space in the universe was condensed into one, infinitesimally (infinitely) small and infinitely hot point in nothing. Matter did not exist, nor time nor anything, because theoretically a singularity does not exist. Now there came a time where something disgruntled this singularity and all of the energy expanded so unimaginably fast, I forget exactly how far, but I do remember Planck Time, which was .00lotsmorzeroeslikeacrazyamount01 of a second or something. Just put it this way it was so fast it the laws of physics would have  pled for mercy. In this incredibly small amount of time, energy particles smashed into other particles and created matter and antimatter. There was a big 'war' between matter and antimatter where the atoms and anti atoms smashed eachother into pure energy, but for every one antimatter and matter collision, there was an extra matter. So the ratio between matter and antimatter was 2:1. Antimatter was annihilated, and the universe kept expanding. Matter clumped together to form stars and those stars exploded eventually and so on.

Please excuse my vague, hugely in a nutshell, description- I'm no scientist!  Basically it is thought that our universe was created in the collision of other universes or 'branes' as part of a presumably endless cycle.  You should read up on it!  You might be able to understand it better than me.  I'm sure there are plenty of other plausible explanations out there, too.  This one just happened to be my favorite.

And, as you'll see in alot of the 'answers' to your question so far, most people are too arrogant and, when it comes down to it, *afraid* to admit that they dont know anything about our universe or where it came from.

We dont even know the big bang happened, its still hugely theoretical.  People say that all signs point to it, but then you go back to it and all of our man-made 'physics' and 'equations' collapse.  Having everything you claim to be supporting a theory collapse when you actually approach the driving point of the theory is flat out idiotic and scientifically inexcusable in any case...except apparently the big bang.

So the real reason that science largely 'stops caring' at the Big Bang is because the big bang is the single instance in time where on one side, all of everything we think we know about the world tends to hold up based on 'scientific fact', and on the other, we find out that our man-made science is completely irrelevant and we can't possibly know anything.

The idea of not possibly being able to know the answer to something makes most scientists and philosophers feel deeply threatened.  The Big Bang is a real case of 'avoid what makes you uncomfortable' for both of those schools of thought.  "	2	0

A way of thinking about space is to imagine a universe with only one particle. Where is it and how fast is it going? You can't tell because both position and velocity are relative and if you only have one particle there's nothing for it to be relative to. So consider the end-of-universe black hole as an elementary particle and you find it _is_ the universe. So when it evaporates, it evaporates back into photons. This is ok because photons don't need a backdrop of space either because (a) they are bosons so they can all be in the same state and (b) they do not experience time.

Manziel ""breaks the pocket"" (meaning he abandons the space behind the offensive line) far to often and to quickly. In college this can work great since defensive players have trouble knowing what to do in these situations (players get conflicted between chasing after the quarterback or staying on their mark, their indecisiveness leads to mistakes). In the NFL, defenses are faster and smarter. NFL defenses almost want you outside of the pocket and they're prepared for running QBs more than ever before. Being short isn't doing Manziel any favors since inside the pocket he's surrounded by big bruisers between 6'3-6'8. This just encourages him to leave the pocket more. 

That's not to say Johnny doesn't have a chance at NFL stardom. The two other short QBs in the league right now are doing pretty well for themselves. Drew Brees  uses his height to his advantage and is perhaps one of the slipperiest QBs to sack inside the pocket. Russell Wilson breaks the pocket frequently, but he, unlike Manziel, knows where his receivers are going to be,and he doesn't throw interceptions trying to make something out of nothing."	3	0

*Encoding* a video is the process of taking light, colour, and sound information and writing it down in a file according to the standard of a *video format*. Video formats are special ways of compressing visual information in an efficient way; uncompressed HD video is a little over 671 GB per hour. Efficient formats can store high quality video at much smaller sizes, but efficiency usually means very complex math and processing, which means it takes your computer a long time to figure out how to write the file down.

This is what is happening when you render a sequence in Final Cut Pro. Your computer is reading the light and colour from the constituent video files, performing complex compression algorithms on them, and outputting them to your specified format, usually MPEG-4 Part 2 ASP, VC-1, MPEG-4 Part 10, or MPEG-2 Part 2. It then takes the sound data and encodes *that* to a format like MPEG-1 Part 3 or AACHC, adds chapters and subtitles, and binds everything up in a 'container file' (MP4, MKV, AVI, etc) kind of like zipping it. This all takes a lot of work.

Streaming or playing a video is much much simpler, and is simply a matter of fetching the visual information back and displaying it. It requires very little computational work -- most modern computers are only under 1-5% load when playing a video, and the server streaming it isn't even playing it, just piping chunks from the hard drive to the network device."	3	0

But, I'm still not clear on how streaming is easier or less intensive or why a render can't be done as fast as a stream. 

Many streams are 1080p so that's a lot of high quality video being sent instantly across the internet. 

I'm editing video that is 720p and sometimes SD, but it still takes ages to render. 

There must be a better way to render video. "	1	0

When Netflix streams something to you, the computer is looking on the hard drive for a file, and piping that file to the network card, where it goes across the internet. Simple.

When you render a video, you are *actually creating that video data*. The software has to look at colour and light and figure out how to represent that as a file without using obscene amounts of space. There are a lot of algorithms that go into this. First there are rounds of intra-frame compression, where the software will look at long stretches of colour, take the first colour value and the last colour value, and instead of storing all values in between, create a mathematical formula that lets the computer generate those values, saving space, and othe rthings like that. Then there's inter-frame compression, where individual moments in the video will only save the data that describes how they have changed relative to *other* moments, reducing the amount of data that needs to be stored at the expense of doing a ton of calculations up-front. Audio compression runs through all the sound data identifying areas unlikely to be audible to humans and cutting those out, to save space without losing quality. Doing that requires analysis from the computer. Really efficient modern video formats have a *ton* of these little tricks that the software does to try to get your filesize down, and that is what your computer is doing when you're rendering. It does all those tricks and writes down some video data.

Actually playing that video data back once it exists is trivial, and that's what streaming is.

Now, there are various video formats you can use and different formats take different amounts of time to render. If you render your video in MPEG-1 format, it will be really fast to render... but it will look like garbage. Because the extra speed comes from the fact that it's not doing as many tricks to get your filesize down. It's like my book analogy: a really good book will take 100 times longer to write than to read, and it's possible to write a book at the same speed you read it at but the book will turn out crap.

&gt; There must be a better way to render video. 

Well, there is. The catch is that there is always a balance between quality and CPU time. You can render in 2 minutes if the video looks like crap, or you can get a video that looks flawless but takes 5 hours to process. Someone could potentially invent a new video format that looks great and takes only a few minutes to encode... but someone could always come along and make that video format twice as good by making it take twice as long."	2	0

No money has a true concrete value, they are just interpretations of a power to exert change, just like a joule in physics. Your dollars are a way of you exerting power. But just like in physics, there are multiple units of measure. In America for example, a single unit of buys you a dollar meal. In Japan, 106 yen is currently equal to one US dollar. How do they get this conversion? They look at the wider economy. There is no definitive way to do this. They look at scales on the economy, power of industry, consumer purchasing power, forecasts, whether Obama is going to invade Iraq again. Just like the stock market, the price is based on speculation and investors' trust. Different groups put out different conversion rates for the same dollar to yen conversion every day. But the changes are miniscule. Think 1/1000 of one penny in difference. But because such large amounts of international trade occurs every day, these small numbers add up. So now you are sitting at home with your debit card. you punch in those digits and off goes your ""money"" to the server in Japan. Your bank knows the money is going to a yen based account in japan, and gives the banks conversion rate, in that moment, (which could have a minuscule difference than what google tells you) to yen. Right now that is in the ball park of 106 yen per 1 USD right now. It is the same process of putting Yen into your account. You don't receive Yen, they are converted into dollars before entering your account. Now the bank wants to get some money out of your business, so you probably have an international conversion fee. Some debit cards have up to 5% or higher conversion fees. This makes me want to shit myself. That equation that the bank did to give your money overseas cost them infinitely close to nothing. They are then going to get a huge capital on your conversion. So in conclusion, you don't own any yen (unless if you buy some in the currency markets but that is low yield investing and is pretty stupid) but your USD have the power to convert to 106 yen per dollar. The bank takes care of it for you, and gives you a fee for an international service. I doubt you are buying that much internationally, so getting a card with a lower conversion fee probably won't be worth it for you, but in my own case, I have been living overseas for three months now, and in that time, lets say I put $1,000 on my credit card (just to make numbers easier). If I had a 5% conversion fee, I would have $50 in fees. My card is only 1%, so I have spent $10 in fees. Now imagine if we were both rich, the difference between our cases would be ginormous. That's why some cards have no international conversion fee. Makes a huge difference for big spenders overseas. If after all of this you still wanted to get your hands on some Yen, you could go to a large city central bank and ask for it in hard currency even here in America. Or you can invest in Yen overseas. It is really complicated, and I would not suggest it for a first time investor or international trader."	1	0

This just means that the music has been 'softened'. You can't blast Carl Cox on the radio, he is just too freaking hardcore of a trancer. The same can be said about the uber groovers the likes of Hardwell and Nicky Romero without vocals. They have harsher, more danceable music that a soccer mom would shut off faster than death metal. Sinner music. But then the thing that unifies these two ideas of progressive is a mellower production. Don't focus on the epic blasts that a drop affords, focus on the progressions and synthesis between instruments and with vocals. Vocals are added, usually in a high, ethereal octave to make there appear to be an emotional basis behind the basic bitch 128 bpm. Go back to the grand daddy. Levels by avicii is oozing with easy going house vibes that are super danceable, but what makes the general audience love it is Etta James killing some Gospel vocals. Still rooted in the danceability of house music. Then you get trance, which just makes you want to go on a trip. Progressive trance is much less established than progressive house, because it is still based on the altered state of consciousness that trance is based off of. There have not been many chart toppers, but think of Armin van Buren and Dash Berlin over Carl Cox.  Cox is a fucking genius, but he is too harsh for the mass market, Armin knows how to spin up some killer vocals and maintain the piercing, high notes and pitches common within trance. The vocals are still not the core of the song that house uses.	1	0

Yeah it's kinda like the electric company deciding to cap your service and cut you off after you use a certain amount. It really makes no sense whatsoever and no one who had the monopoly on utilities ever did that. The phone companies 30 years ago were like the ISPs today and they never even thought of doing that. They just charged you on your bill up the ass but it's better than capping you at least. It's beyond greedy and fascist and I hope that net neutrality stays indefinitely.

Funny thing is they would profit more if they did like the phone companies did. As draconian as it would be, I'd rather them just charge you a bit more if you want to keep using up their bandwidth. Having different caps and different ""premiums"" like cable TV is beyond fucking outdated and a really illogical model to use in modern times. It'd ruin the internet and people would probably stop using it or use it only limited amount. No one can afford to be jerked around for things anymore and it's happening with cable already as people already turn to Netflix and other services and either downgrade their cable channels or cancel it all together.

Obviously they just want to control everything and profit as much as possible. It's a shame they have the monopoly and it's a shame we have to deal with their greedy ways if we want internet service. It should be a public utility and not something owned by a fascist corporation."	3	0

Basically, your brain is capable of storing motor patterns and using them without much thought (in some cases, no conscious thought at all). A motor pattern is what we casually think of as ""coordination"", though coordination can also be used in other contexts. It is learned, meaning our brain memorizes the pattern and spews it back out to the muscles without the need for interpretation or thought.

""Right leg, left leg"" is just the tip of the iceberg. Timing of various muscle activations, amount of force production, and variable tension in the supporting muscles all come into play as well.

Motor control is a form of memory essentially. You may have heard of the term 'muscle memory' when someone is describing how an athlete automatically reacts to something. For example, a soccer player would get there hand out of the way of the ball without thinking. They would be shitty defenders in basketball because they would have to think before putting their hand in the way of a pass and would be too slow. They would have to ""learn"" to react differently."	2	0

The main obstacles to that are two things:

First, the things in your house which currently use the most power (refrigerator, lights, stove) all operate on AC current anyway. As a percentage of energy used consumer electronics are still a small consideration when wiring a whole house.

Second, anytime you talk about changing things when it comes to electrical standards you have to realize for 98% of houses it means expensive re-wiring and your product will fail pretty quickly if you only plan for it to work in houses that are built brand new.

Everything we have and use is already based on AC power to the wall outlet, so to transition over to DC power completely would cost a staggering amount of infrastructure alterations, which are expensive.  Once you get to a certain point of adapting a technology, it just becomes too expensive.

The device that changes AC power to DC power is called a rectifier (I work with them on a semi-regular basis in the telecom industry, which routinely uses DC power), and to give you an idea of the cost of altering everything, a 100 amp rectifier (roughly half of the circuit rating on a typical house) runs about $2000, if I remember the pricing correctly.  All appliances would either need to be reengineered to run on DC power or have an inverter (converts DC to AC) installed which would then add additional costs for existing devices (roughly $100 per 1000 W of continuous output power).  All of these devices add points of failure into your the power grid of your house and could possibly need replaced every few years.  That's a lot of money to spend, so you have to ask yourself - how much would we be getting back for this investment?

Edit: don't forget installation costs and engineering for those installations as well.  Those people need to pay their bills too."	1	0

The devices that you're thinking of are what currently rules our electrical life. Remember though, that having 30 DC adapters spread throughout your house is a relatively new reality. Up until the 70s &amp; 80s (and even arguably later) the elctric gadgets that you had around your house consisted of one of two main components: a heating (curling iron, hot plate, light bulbelement or a motor (washing machine, vacuum, drill blender). Aside from your TV &amp; radio, the vast majority of what we plugged into the wall at home was never converted to DC.

Had silicon integrated circuits been invented before the table saw, DC may have had a chance to hold out, but our infrastructure was now all DC. It would cost me probably $2000 to $3000 to retrofit my house to do something like that or I could just pay an extra $5 when I buy my wireless router to have a DC transformer come along with it. 

There is a little bit of this happening though. I some work on a lot of new construction projects (and travel a lot) and there are a lot of of sports stadiums and other public venues that are starting to put large numbers of USB charging outlets so that fans/visitors can use their their devices during their visit without having to carry a wall wart with them.

To be truly self-reliant you'd have to connect to no other systems at all - at which point you're not a part of the internet anymore. You'd be a separate network, unique and independent.

Once a species goes below a certain mathematically modeled population known as the 'extinction threshold', it is essentially on a one way road to extinction with no turning back. For this reason we can actually watch a lot of species that have passed the extinction threshold and track them as they vanish. It's all the more tragedy for the fact that there's little we can do but watch in some cases.

We can also track ecosystem loss. With the exception of humans, who can alter their environment, all other creatures are dependent on a specific type of ecosystem and sudden jumps to different ecosystems are rare. No ecosystem left = none of the creatures that once inhabited it left. 

Finally I feel like I should note that while you're correct in saying much of our ocean depths are unexplored, the same doesn't hold true for landmasses. Even the most remote areas of the Sahara and the Amazon are pretty well mapped, if not to a global audience at least on a local level. There are very few areas of land left on the planet that human eyes haven't fallen on. "	6	0

But say with rhinos, we know where rhinos live, in a very small stretch of a couple of savannas in Africa. We're almost certain that there are no rhinos anywhere else. So if the rhinos disappear from those habitats we know about, we can be almost positive that they're extinct everywhere.

In your shower as you turn the water on only cold water is allowed to enter the valve. As you continue turning the valve is opened to the point where hot water is allowed to mix with the cold water. Eventually turning the valve all the way will allow mostly, if not exclusively, hot water. Interestingly some valves have a built in temperature regulator which consists of a spring and a plunger. The spring is made of a material which is very responsive to changes in temperature. It will expand as it gets hotter and contract ad it get cooler. If the spring gets to hot it will push the plunger across the hot water connection. There is a screw which can be turned to not allow water over a certain temperature to leave the valve. This prevents someone from scalding themselves. This concept is the same for the kitchen except you can choose which temperature you want to achieve when the sink if first turned on instead of having to always start at the coolest setting. For a faucet with multiple handles there are two valves. One connected to hot and one connected to cold. They both connect to the same faucet and you control the mixing by how far each is opened. 	3	0

Some homes have a pump which will recirculate the water in the hot water line back to the hot water heater. This is typically done to the plumbing fixture which is located furthest from the hot water heater. More common in the north but many restaurants do this at hand washing sinks. Another way to accomplish on demand hot water is to install an instantaneous hot water heater. Doing this requires more forethought as the appliance must have a dedicated breaker instead of connecting to any nearby 120V circuit. The next time you are out to eat and you go to the bathroom check out the sink. If you get hot water almost immediately there is a good chance one of these two methods has been used. Some business will install the small water heater right under the sink. It will be the same size as a wall hung first aid kit	1	0

A Neural Network is basically a mathematical model, inspired by the human brain, that can be used to discover patterns in data. The input (your data, for example a spoken sentence ""I like cats"") goes into the Neural Network, gets processed through the nodes in the hidden layer(s) and output comes out (for example, a prediction for the sounds/words the model estimates were said before, based on the earlier data it has seen). 
The difference between a Neural Network and Deep Learning is simply that most Neural Networks only have a couple hidden layers, and in Deep Learning there are many more, allowing for more complex patterns.
There's much, much more to these things, and if you're interested I'd suggest looking at Andrew Ng's lectures on Machine Learning on Coursera. 

Edit: https://class.coursera.org/ml-005/lecture/preview

Edit 2: Google has used Unsupervised (basically, supplying data without saying what it is) Deep Learning on images, and the Neural Network learned what the concept of ""cat"" is without anyone ever telling it ""this is a picture of a cat"".

The first is the ""good ol-fashioned"" way, where you code, by hand, each individual thing you want the computer to recognize. For example, in Apple and Google code they have to tell their system to do things and it looks something like this (note: this is not code, just an example):

If you hear ""search for [blank]"" do a google search for the [blank].
 
If you hear ""what is [blank]"" do a google search for the [blank].

If you hear ""who is [blank]"" do a google search for the [blank].

If you hear ""[words that are not another command]"" do a google search for those words.

If you hear ""How are you?"" respond with ""Fine, how are you?""

If you hear ""What is the weather like in [blank]"" open weather app for the [blank] location""


As you can imagine, there are hundreds of possible phrases that all mean ""google this for me"". There are also thousands of possible commands, all of which need answers and all of those answers need to be specifically coded with statements like those above. ALSO, each individual word like ""search"" needs to be hand coded and specifically trained to recognize every accent, pitch, account for noisy rooms, etc. So naturally, anything you don't specifically code for is not recognized. It thus takes a LONG time to code every possible command and the subsequent outcomes (including all the cheeky things like ""tell me a joke""), and anything you don't specifically put in there is not recognized at all. Apple and Google are good at doing this, and users generally only give a few commands, so it works ok. But it doesn't really ""learn"", except in trivial cases where you say ""call me Danger Pants"" and it changes your name to ""Danger Pants"". 

The other approach, called deep learning or connectionist modeling, tries to avoid this by only coding for the PARTS of speech. You start by looking at the ""suh"", ""err"", ""chuh"" syllables, and all the other syllables in an utterance. Then you have hidden units that analyze how they are put together - in ways that we don't really see and it would be very complicated to unravel it all to figure it out. In the model you linked to, there are 5 levels of hidden units, which in the end discover what command to do. It ""learns"" what to do, not by following a set of rules like the ones above, but by analyzing very large datasets filled with pairs speech utterances and the proper command that follows them. Just like when I say ""how are you?"" to you, you don't go ""question received, respond with friendly phrase""; instead, you just KNOW based on experience what the proper thing to say is, even if it isn't a rule hard-wired in your brain. 

The advantage of the deep learning system is that it can be much for flexible, can learn without you having to spend hundreds of hours coding each command, and probably is more like human speech where it will eventually recognize every word. The disadvantage is it is extremely difficult to know/figure out HOW it learned to recognize each individual command, so it can be harder to edit/censor/control . "	2	0

The stores are able to purchase and sell these items at a lower cost because they are guaranteed sales for the manufacturer.  The store places an order with the manufacturer and has a contract to purchase all of it, so the manufacturer doesn't have to figure spoilage (wasted, unsold product) into the equation.  

Also, while many stores actually make less of a profit off of each item than they do from name brand items, the store brand items are advertisements themselves.

1) The store brand is not produced exclusively for the store by the store. It's produced at scale by a third-party (sometimes the same vendor that produces the ""name"" brand) and re-sold under *multiple* local store brands. So the scale is the same, but instead of every can of peas from the production run getting the ""name brand"" label, 10% of the cans get the ""Store X"" label, another 10% get the ""Store Y"" label, etc. 

2) The name brand has marketing and advertising costs that the store brand does not. For example, you'll see commercials for Kraft Macaroni &amp; Cheese on prime time TV, but you'll *never* see a commercial anywhere for Store X Macaroni &amp; Cheese. In effect, the store brand is getting ""trickle down"" advertising -- people see Kraft Macaroni &amp; Cheese in the store, remember that ad that made it look yummy, but then look down two shelves and see the store brand is 20% less and probably as good or nearly so. That price difference is due to brand value &amp; marketing costs. The ""name brand"" vendors are banking on the fact that more people will pay for the recognizable brand than ""settle"" for the store brand (and they're usually right). "	2	0

There are 10 beads on each rod, and there are a set number of rods. Each rod is a unit place, so the first rod represents the singles, the second rod represents the 10's, the third one represents 100's and so on and so forth.

.

You  can then use each rod to denote a value or add together values. For each 10 1's beads you place to the right you have made the number 10. If you can place 1 10's bead to the right and then reset the 1's rod. SO, if 5 1's beads are to the right, 2 10's beads, 0 100's beads and 9 1000's beads you have created the number 9025 using just 16 beads all an all.

.

So, for a visual explanation:

~~00000 - - - - - -00000~~


~~000 - - - - - -0000000~~


~~0 - - - - - -000000000~~

on an abacus would be equal to 5 1's (the top rod has 5 beads on the right), There is 7 10's (7 beads are on the right on the second row) and there are 9 100's (9 beads on the right on the last row).

So, this abacus represents 5 + 7 * 10 + 9 * 100 =975. 
If you then want to subtract 133 you just move one bead from the lowest row and place it to the left, three on the middle row, and three on the top row. The resulting abacus then looks like this:

~~00000000 - - - - - -00~~


~~000000 - - - - - -0000~~


~~00 - - - - - -00000000~~

and you find the result: 2+4 * 10+8 * 100 = 842

Let's imagine something simple: 3 * 6.

~~0000000000----------~~ Rod B1

~~0000----------000000~~ Rod A1

~~0000000000----------~~ Rod C

~~0000000000----------~~ Rod B2

~~0000000----------000~~ Rod A2

Here we've split the abacus into two sections: the top rod is 10's, second is 1's. The bottom rod is then also 1's, and above it 10's. I've marked the rods for simplicity. 

The general idea is to, one by one, move the beads on the upper sector to the left, and add the same time add as many beads to the lower sector as required. So, we move one bead from A 1 to the left, but do nothing with A2 (since 1 x 3 = 3, but we already have 3 in the lower rod.). We then keep doing this, we remove 1 more bead from A1 (now there are 4 beads to the right) and add 3 beads to A2 (6). then we remove the next one from A1, and add 3 to A2. There are now 3 beads on A1, and 9  on A2. 

The process then just loops around like this. One bead from A1. Add three to A2 (Or rather, add 1 to the 1's, but then we hit 10 beads on A2. So we remove all the beads from A2, add one to B2 (10's) and then add the two we are missing to A2. After we've removed all of the beads from A1 the final answer will be on the bottom. I've added a visual step by step text file on dropbox at the bottom of this comment. The final abacus looks like this now:

~~0000000000----------~~ Rod A1

~~0000000000----------~~ Rod B2

~~0000000000----------~~ Rod C

~~000000000----------0~~ Rod B2

~~00----------00000000~~ Rod A2

10 + 8 = 18. thus 3 * 6 = 18.

.



But what happens if we have two double digit numbers? Say, 12 * 16?

The inital abacus looks like this

~~000000000----------0~~ Rod B1

~~0000----------000000~~ Rod A1

~~0000000000----------~~ Rod C

~~000000000----------0~~ Rod B2

~~00000000----------00~~ Rod A2

The process starts off normally. Remove a bead from A1, leave the lower alone. Then we remove another bead from A1, and add 12 to the lower half (2 on A2, 1 on B2). Remove a bead from A1, add 12 to A2/B2 and rolling over whenever either reaches 10, as with single digit multiplication. We keep doing that until all the beads have been removed from A1.Then we move over to B1. Then the process keeps going, but instead of adding 12 when we remove a bead from B1, we add 120 (So, instead of adding 2 to A2 and 1 to B2, we add 2 to B2 and 1 to C. Since we only have one bead on B1 we only add 120 once. 

The final abacus looks like this:

~~0000000000----------~~ Rod B1


~~000000000----------~~ Rod A1

.



~~000000000----------0~~ Rod C


~~0----------000000000~~ Rod B2


~~00000000----------00~~ Rod A2

100 + 90 + 20 = 192. Using a calculator we multiply 12 by 16 and confirm that it is in deed 192. a visual step by step is also in the text file I mentioned.

- crimes committed by an Austrian citizen against an Austrian citizen if both have their usual residence in Austria
- a few other crimes such as air piracy, membership in a terrorist organization, financing a terrorist organization, under certain circumstances such as if the perpetrator is an Austrian citizen

However, the following two paragraphs – translations into English are mine – are also relevant in this case:

- § 66. If the perpetrator has already served a sentence abroad for the crime they are convicted for domestically, the sentence inflicted domestically shall be reduced by the respective amount.
- § 73. Unless the law explicitly requires conviction by a domestic court, foreign convictions are equivalent to domestic ones if they find the offender guilty due to an action that is also juridicially punishable according to Austrian law, and have been issued in a trial conforming to the principles of Article 6 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.

1) Your immune system making your body inhospitable to the invader.  This includes fevers, often vomiting, inflammation, etc.  This isn't the virus, it's your body doing it and hoping the virus dies before you do.

2)Intended to spread the virus.  This means coughing, sneezing, vomiting (of course there's massive overlap between the two), sometimes bleeding, etc.  Here the virus is trying to spread to new hosts since you'll eventually die anyways, and it doesn't mind doing a bit of damage to you to do it.

Also remember that things don't necessarily evolve to do what's in their ""best interest.""  They evolve in whatever direction is temporarily favorable until they reach a peak, then stay there until either the environment changes or they get a really lucky mutation.  

Decreased lethality is often going to be favorable to a virus, that's why you have like 200 common cold viruses and only like 3 ebola viruses.  And common cold is everywhere while ebola is still only in africa"	3	0

This means that a virus that kills the host and therefore dies itself quickly becomes extinct, while less deadly viral strains that do not kill survive to spread. Thus, for the extremely deadly varieties, we typically see them in areas of higher population density where they can quickly spread before dying out. 	3	0

Anthrax is something from livestock, ebola from wildlife in Africa, HIV we picked up from apes, and all of these hosts for these diseases survive these infections much more successfully than humans.  If it killed its host without spreading, it would die out.  If it kills a human accidentally infected while spreading between its primary hosts, oh well, humans are irrelevant to its normal life cycle anyway, that was just an accident.  An successful strain infecting humans would if course be a nice added bonus, but one of the adaptations needed to successfully infect humans as well would likely be less lethality, to allow more time to spread.	2	0

Soldiers *do* protect our rights in the sense that, at least for the US, without a standing military, we likely wouldn't have those rights for very long.

The problem is that when soldiers are sent somewhere to fight, it's not always the right choice- sometimes it is, sometimes it's not, but *the soldiers never make that choice*. The elected representatives and the administrations we as citizens elect make those choices.

Soldiers are tools, weapons to be used and they should in a perfect world not be abused. However, our world is not perfect, and sometimes people are ignorant, stupid or just plain wrong. And soldiers pay the price.

The notion that soldiers protect our freedoms is broadly true. Soldiers, at least in the US, volunteer to be members of the military, and many do so out of patriotism in the belief that their country will not misuse the power that they are giving to their country.

You don't say 50 minus 1, you say 40 + 9. 

That's why 99 is XCIX instead of IC, because you first convey the tens place (XC), then the ones place. (IX)

**Edit**: Many users have pointed out some facets to this logic. Firstly that while this is a base ten number system, it has one special difference from the Arabic system. You may subtract 1 power of ten from something that is in the next power of ten. So following that logic we have



Arabic | Roman
---|---
9 | IX
40 | XL
90 | XC
900| CM

This is similar to how the french say Quatre-Vingt for 80. (4 20's) You still treat and say IX as 9 and XL as 40, you don't say 10 minus 1 and 50 minus 10.

However, the power had not rested in Rome for some time. Constantinople was the capital of the Empire (and fell in 1453, nearly a thousand years later.) the idea of Rome as the grand capital city wasn't true except during the Republic and early Empire; the Empire followed the Emperor(s) (see the four capital cities during the tetrarchy of Diocletian.) 

The capital was wherever the imperium maius was. Imperium is a concept originating in the military and was originally one's legal right to command, it eventually evolved into a more general concept. Maius is the highest imperium. So whoever was able to command, to bend others to their will moreso than any other, that was Rome. Rome was in reality a concept more than a city. 

And Rome spread like a virus through Europe and the Mediterranean infecting civilizations. London was originally a Roman settlement; Hadrian's wall roughly divides Scotland from the rest of the isle. London became in many ways the third Rome (and the most successful incarnation to date.)

Nearly three hundred years ago a group of men wrote letters using Roman pseudonyms arguing over the best way to form a Republic. And they named their upper house the Senate and modeled their executive branch after the Roman consuls of old. 

If you think Rome fell look at the flag of the hegemon and see if a golden eagle is perched at the top of the pole. "	8	0

1. Ancient romans used the additive form (IIII instead of IV).
1. The reason for this is that the numbers could be added easily by grouping the concatenated bits together then reducing right to left.  XXVIIII (29) + LXXXI (81) = LXXXXXV~~IIIII~~ = LXXXXX~~V**V**~~ = LX~~XXXX**X**~~ = ~~L**L**~~X = **C**X = 110.
1. Multiplication using roman numerals was weird but easier with the additive form.  Watch the video for the gory details on that.

Originally, roman numerals were taken from the concept of a number line (hashes marked on a shepherd's staff) ||||/||||\\||||/||||\\\ But where writing for example 8, instead of ||||/||| you could remove the |s before the / because with the / came the knowledge that there were four | before it. Similarly with 9 it was easier to just say |\ because those symbols represented a position on the line that implies the rest of the marks before it.

Eventually / evolved into V and \ into X for writing and other numerals were invented for higher numbers. The system evolved independent of the number line and the subtractive convention of IV or XL was usually bypassed for the clearer IIII or XXXX except when space or time was an issue, such as when carving onto buildings."	17	0

The entire regular season is played in a different calendar year than the championship game in the NFL. This Super Bowl on Feb 1, 2015 will decide the 2014 season champ. So calling it super bowl 2014 would be dumb, and calling it super bowl 2015 will eventually become confusing while looking up stats to prove who's right at bar arguments in the future. As to why Roman numerals are less confusing than super bowl 49, see the NFL logic on wife punching in elevators. 

Fun fact 2: auto correct tried multiple times to make ""super bowl"" become ""superb owl"". "	26	0

The main insight here is that converting a number into a roman numeral isn't a number base conversion, you are simply replacing the symbols that represent the value at each position in the number.

The creation of each SYMBOL, NOTE: each symbol usually has multiple characters in it, of course observes the subtract to the left and add to the right rule that Roman numerals use.

Ones place

| Decimal VALUE | Arabic SYMBOL | Roman numeral SYMBOL |
|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|
| 1 | 1 | I | 
| 2 | 2 | II | 
| 3 | 3 | III | 
| 4 | 4 | IV | 
| 5 | 5 | V | 
| 6 | 6 | VI |
| 7 | 7 | VII |
| 8 | 8 | VIII |   
| 9 | 9 | IX | 

Tens place

| Decimal VALUE | Arabic SYMBOL | Roman numeral SYMBOL |
|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|
| 10 | 1 | X | 
| 20 | 2 | XX | 
| 30 | 3 | XXX | 
| 40 | 4 | XL | 
| 50 | 5 | L | 
| 60 | 6 | LX |
| 70 | 7 | LXX |
| 80 | 8 | LXXX |   
| 90 | 9 | XC | 

Hundreds place

| Decimal VALUE | Arabic SYMBOL | Roman numeral SYMBOL |
|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|
| 100 | 1 | C | 
| 200 | 2 | CC | 
| 300 | 3 | CCC | 
| 400 | 4 | CD | 
| 500 | 5 | D | 
| 600 | 6 | DC |
| 700 | 7 | DCC |
| 800 | 8 | DCCC |   
| 900 | 9 | CM | 

And we'll stop there because transcribing roman numbers in tables is boring.

To describe the process of the actual conversion:

Take for example the number 123. That is One hundred, Twenty, and Three.

Ones place: value 3, arabic symbol 3, roman numeral III

Tens place: value 20, arabic symbol 2, roman numeral XX

Hundreds places: value 100, arabic symbol 1, roman numeral C

So in the ones places we put the symbol III, in the tens places we put XX, in the hundreds places we put C
Result: CXXIII

You can still picture this as three symbols C XX III 


and as an intersting side note, the Romans didn't have have the concept of zero in this traditional system.

tl;dr The reason the Roman numerals are the way they are is that they are Really just a different set of symbols in the same counting system, and you could no more change the order of them than you could change 123 into 132 without changing the number you are representing."	66	0

Well, is the difference between imperial and metric similar to the difference between Roman and Arabic/Indic numerals?  

The math is all the same, it's just a bit easier to do metric since everything is divisible by 10.  But when you consider the fact that everyone has easy access to calculators, it becomes much less of an issue.

The US has partially adopted the metric system.  The sciences use them.  They just flat out *do*.  So it's not as though the US will suffer in the sciences because of the lack of the metric system.  Children *are* taught the metric system.  I sure as hell was and I was born in 1989. The problem is that it isn't enforced in general society so some of the values don't stick in your head quite easily.  Most things regarding food are measured in imperial, except soft drinks, which are sometimes measured in liters.  *All* Americans know how much two liters is.  We have trouble with celsius and kilograms and kilometers, but most people know that a kilometer is something like half a mile.  Anyone in the military knows what a ""klick"" is.  We use mostly feet and inches but most people know a meter is ""about a yard"" and I'm pretty sure most of us know how much a centimeter and millimeter is.

EDIT: and, of course, don't forget the drug trade!  Metric literacy--for mass at least--is relatively very high in poor inner-city neighborhoods.  

So it's partially adopted.  Not half, maybe a quarter to a third adopted.

The reason why it's not fully adopted is because it would probably be economically costly to switch over."	1	0

Except everything is labeled and written in metric units. Instead of a set of measuring cups with 1 cup, 1/2 cup, 1/4 cup, 1/3 cup sizes, they have measuring cups in 250ml, 125ml, 60ml, 80ml sizes. Instead of measuring spoons of 1Tbsp, 1tsp, etc, they have measuring spoons of 15ml, 5ml, etc sizes.

The big difference comes in using recipes which are given in weights, which actually isn't so much a metric thing as a non-US thing. Recipes in the US tended to be weight-based until the mid-1800s.

But even that is easy, with today's modern scales. If you have a recipe which calls for a mise-en-place (pre-measuring lots of small things so you can quickly add it to the recipe when needed and not have to futz with measuring while cooking), instead of using spoons or cups to measure, simply put each ingredient's bowl on the scale, hit ""tare/zero"", measure in the ingredient until the correct weight is hit, and then take the bowl off and go to the next ingredient.

Many recipes call for mixing together lots of dry or lots of wet ingredients. In that case, you can simply put your mixing bowl on the scale, hit ""tare/zero"", measure in one ingredient, hit ""tare/zero"" again, measure the next on top, etc. It's quick, it doesn't mess up a lot of measuring cups and spoons, and once you do it a couple of times, it's easy.

Not having scales is not an option in any case as volume just *is not appropriate* to measure most things. And as you're mentioning flour: Generally speaking, bread recipes aren't expressed in grams but percentages relative to weight of flour.

So if you've got a sourdough stage that calls for a dough yield of 180 at a certain temperature for some time: 100 is the flour, 80 is water. As such, if you've got 500g flour, you need 400g water (which yes is 400ml). Which might differ a bit as not every flour soaks equally, and you also have to factor in the dough yield of the finished sourdough you put into that stage.

Then you add 2% of flourweight salt. And spices. Which I actually do by putting my mortar on the scale, hitting ""tare"" and then going from there. All hail cheap electronic scales, still being gram-accurate after putting 3kg of stone on it."	2	0

2^6 = 64 is enough to represent all English letters, numerals, whitespace, punctuation, etc., so 6-bit is ideal for encoding a character. This of course does not take case into account, which is why old printouts and computer-code is often written completely in capital letters. 7 or 8 bit ASCII characters were seen as wasteful.

36 bits also allows you a to represent all integers from -10 billion to +10 billion, which was seen as important as many people still worked in decimal rather than binary, so 36bits is essentially just enough for a sign bit + 10 decimal digits. EDIT: I should mention that the ""calculators"" (basically computers) of the day used 10 decimal digits, so an IBM mainframe should at least be able to do that.

This idea that everything should be powers of 2 that is drilled into modern CS students has not always been so obvious (and maybe some confident CS students ought to take a step back and ask themselves how sure they are that powers of 2 are *always* the right choice).

[Programming Conversations course at A9 by Alexander Stepanov](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-meLQaYP5Y&amp;list=PLHxtyCq_WDLXFAEA-lYoRNQIezL_vaSX-)

It is quite long and conversational (hence the name I suppose). Great for relaxing or while playing a game that does not have a lot of dialogue. Stepanov has lived through much of this stuff and has some strong opinions that he is not afraid to share. Plenty of great tales of how CS and programming was actually developed, which is both instructive in an indirect way but it is also fun hearing about the most esteemed people in the field not thinking a compiler would be worth the bother, as programmer girls are much cheaper, and similar anecdotes."	12	0

Instead of one to ten, you can count one to thirty five, one hand for single numbers, the other hand for sixes. It's not gonna be as nice as binary, but it's a lot more intuitive, and can be used for holding up a number more effectively - face one hand in and one hand out. The palm you show is ones, the palm you don't is sixes.

Even though we do have lots of Roman artifacts it's not clear if the relics that are preserved are truly indicative of day-to-day usage--for example, you might write one notation by hand but when you end up carving/engraving, use a more formal notation.

It could be Super Bowl IC or Super Bowl 2014 or Super Bowl TacoBell if they wanted. It is not constrained by history, number systems, or anything else but arbitrary decisions on whether they're going to make money, or whether they're going to make *more* money. Roman numerals are merely a hint of a suggestion to avoid ambiguity.

Next year, it will be *Super Bowl 50*; it will not be *Super Bowl L*.

Why? Because the NFL named it Super Bowl 50, and for no other reason.

""everi"" should be ""evri"".  ""haes"" should be ""haez"".  ""whu"" should be ""hu"".  ""qwait"" should be ""kwait"".  There are other things problematic with it.

I'm not a huge fan of whatever mode you're going with for a few reasons.  One, it deviates from the basic ASCII character set, which inherently makes it more difficult for people from other languages to write in, because they have to memorize keybindings for some of the characters.  Vowels are, of course, difficult in English because English has a relative lot of them.  You could always change some lowercase to uppercase ones, or do digraphs.  My idea has always been to add a puncuation mark of some sort to indicate an alternate form of the vowel.  For example, to distinguish ""ae"" from ""a"" you can do ""a:"" or ""a~"".

The character choices you make also seem unintuitive.  I see you use ""x"" for ""sh"".  Isn't ""x"" more generally used for ""ch"" though?  Unless you're doing tx to indicate that sound.  You use ""dj"" for the basic ""j"" sound, and I'm not sure why.  I'm guessing it's because ""j"" is for the sound in ""pleasure""?  ""a"" in ""couple"" is very unintuitive for me also. I really dislike ""oh"" to indicate ""althOUGH"".  One flaw in modern english orthography is that ""h"" is the quick way to indicate a short vowel, along with double consonant after, and in opposition to the silent e.  But here, you're using it to indicate a long o sound.  And the hard C sound should always be K.

Here's my proposal:

æ|ɑ|ɔ|ɪ|i|ɛ/e|ʌ|ʊ|u|eɪ|aɪ|ɔɪ |əʊ/oʊ|aʊ
---|---|----|----|----|----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
a:|a|o|i|e:|e|u|u:|u~|e~|i~|o~|o:|a~|

m|n|ŋ|p|t|k|b|d|g|tʃ|dʒ|f|v|θ|ð|s|z|ʃ|ʒ|h|r|l|j|w
---|---|----|----|----|----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|----|----|----|---|---|---|---
m|n|n:|p|t|k|b|d|g|c|j|f|v|t:|d:|s|z|s:|z:|h|r|l|y|w

Which would turn the alphabet into:  
abcdefghijklmnoprstuvwyz

Not how the tilde effectively acts like a y does now.  It turns letters into diphthongs, but doesnt result in ambiguity.

Which means if you raelly wanted to, you could change s: and z: to x and q, but I think that would be unintuitive for both of them.

&gt;wic me:nz if yu~ wantid tu~, yu~ ku:d ce~nj ""s:"" a:nd ""z:"" tu~ ""x"" a:nd ""q"", but i~ t:ink d:a~t wud be: unintu~itiv for bo:t: uv d:em.

Hmm.

There are a lot of : and ~'s there, but if keyboards had those as standard keys that weren't difficult to type then that sentence wouldn't be difficult to type. If you were lazy you could also write:

&gt;wic menz if yu wantid tu, yu kud cenj ""s:"" and ""z:"" tu ""x"" and ""q"", but I tink dat wud be unintuitiv for bot uv dem.

You also had another commenter working for a big company and he sais they are not using the metric system.

I wasn't guessing, I'm also talking of experience. The average Joe out there has no idea what 3 meters look like, plain and simple. Again, even NASA was still partially using the imperial system not long ago. Freaking NASA!

I'm not saying nobody uses the metric system, but just because you work with a couple of firms using it doesn't mean most people do. See here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrication_in_the_United_States#Current_use

It's definitely use, at least in theory, but only very selectively. Off topic: I'm always fascinated how people can measure things with the imperial system and yet, we have evidence that a lot of Americans thought a third pounder was smaller than a quarter pounder as a burger lol"	1	0

The author, Rick Riordan, has taught many years of Greek mythology as well as Roman and Egyptian mythology, and his spelling of 49 is XLIX.

The reason for this is that 40 = XL: 10 less than 50. This means that you must continue from there.

* 41 = XLI
* 42 = XLII
* 43 = XLIII
* 44 = XLIV
* 45 = XLV
* 46 = XLVI
* 47 = XLVII
* 48 = XLVIII

Parts of a whole will exist no matter what. Even in a base 12 system 12/5 would still give you a decimal. The nice thing about base 12 vs 10 (and maybe 15, didn't do the basic math) is that there aren't any infinite decimals. If you divide 10 by 3, you'll see that you get an infinite number, which is annoying, unreliable, and over long equations can mess things up. With a base 12, there's no, or very few, divisions you can make that create an infinite decimal. If we revisit 12/5, a number you and I both know won't be whole, is still a very easy to manage 2.4. Idk about you but I would rather rely on a long equation that starts with 2.4 vs 3.3333333 repeating infinitely. A mathier person than I maybe able to clean that up.

The rules we apply to the Roman numeral system aren't Roman. They used it pretty well arbitrarily even down in the 'well understood' parts that below ten. Fundamentally IL would be just as correct as what the alternative and there's no really firm rule.

The TL;DR answer is most likely that the people doing it just kept counting up without thinking. If they did think they probably thought the more complicated form looked cooler."	0	0

Well, sort of.  It's organized around powers of 10, although since it's not a standard [place-value number system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_notation), it's not really *base*-anything.  X means ten whether you write it as 10 (base ten), A (base 16), 14 (base 6), etc.  

Roman numerals do, however, share the property that the higher-valued symbols are written first.  Except when they aren't - and when they aren't, that's when you know to subtract instead of add. 

But all of the examples we've found of subtractive numerals - which weren't universal, and it wasn't uncommon to see IIII for 4, etc - skip at most one other symbol in value.  Apparently, it was OK to write IV or IX, but not IL or IC.   XL or XC, but not XD or XM.

Which is why years from the end of the previous century were such convoluted Roman numerals, and we had to party like it was MCMXCIX instead of, say, MIM... or even I(MM). :)"	1	0

If you're asking why ""legio"" is feminine and not masculine (which is a fair question, since a legion is a group of men), I don't have a good answer.

In the example above, the XL represents the 4 in the tens column.  Add the remaining letters for the ones column to get your full decimal value.  So what did we do for 1990?

1000 + 900 + 90 + 0 = 1990

(M) + (CM) + (XC) = MCMXC

2000 + 10 + 5 = 2015

(MM) + (X) + (V) = MMXV

...and in the OP's question...

40 + 9 = 49

(XL) + (IX) = 49

With that being said, my real response should be...

Then you use your right hand to count, starting with the same position as the left hand and then placing your thumb on the tip of your pinky, then the middle part and then bottom part of your pinky and then you do the same with your ring finger and so on.

Giving you the ability to count to 12 on one hand and when you reach 12 you move your left hand thumb to the middle part of your pinky and count to 12 again with your right hand and continue like that.

It's a bit hard to explain in text (and English isn't my first language) but it gives you the ability to count to 144 with your hands instead of just 10 and when you understand it, it's very easy to quickly see what number you're at even if someone interrupts you as long as you keep holding your fingers in the same place, I still count like this now."	2	0

so why am i mentioning this, because in roman numerals you aren't really doing math, the number 50 is L and the number 40 is XL and the number 10 is X and the number 9 is IX so the number 49 is XLIX, there is some math behind that but the average person writing the numbers doesn't have to know this nor do any kind of math just as you needn't do the math to derive 239 from arabic numerals. so if you take your approach one would need to calculate IL by taking 50-1...course they could also get it by taking 40 and adding 9 giving the familiar XLIX or you could take 51 and subtract 2 giving IILI or take 20+20+9 and get XXXXIX lot's of ways to derive 49, but having the 10's place by XL and the 1s place be IX makes more sense.

so the short answer then is: it's not IL because IL isn't 49 in roman numerals."	4	0

Eh, not quite right. They used to have an ""intercalary period"", a number of days between years of roughly 59 days. The year ended on the last day of December, and begain 59 days later on the first day of March. Dividing the intercalary period into months and adding them to the calendar was one of the reforms pushed by Julius Caesar. "	2	0

It's retarded. Yes, it's a power of 2, but it's 2^3, it's not a power of 2 to something useful..like...say another power of 2 as in binary 2^(2^0) or hexadecimal 2^(2^2).

This means you often get results that are wrong because a byte is 8 bits and octal can only count to 7 before it flips so your answer is either correct or needs an adjustment so you always have to check the overflow buffer.
Seriously retarded.

That's all just to point out that while 6 might have been correct since it can be used as the base of a number system (as can pretty much anything if you try hard enough) and professors often pick some of the dumb ones as examples just to show that it works; in the context of computers it's not just retarded, it's worse than octal which I believe I made the case for being ""seriously"" retarded.

2^3 does not integrate with an 8 bit byte. This is because 3 is not a power of 2.

In decimal, you can represent a byte as a number between 0 and 254

In binary, each digit is a bit, so 00000000 through 11111111

In hex(adecimal) each digit is 4 bits (or a nybble)
so a byte is 00 through FF

In octal you have extra bits or maybe you don't. So every calculation you do you have to take your answer, then check the overflow register to see if your answer is correct or if you have to bit-shift it and store the value across multiple bytes.

They should have dedicated a second sentence to octal, saying that it sucks."	1	0

I'm confused. You say you convert to the imperial system in order to get more accurate with calipers? No. Merely by converting, you're losing accuracy to however many significant figures you rounded to in your conversions, and then you have to convert it back, losing more accuracy again. Furthermore, neither system is ""more accurate"" than the other. You can always do the math at an infinitely smaller scale with either system.

So when saying 1479, you write it like 1000 + (500 - 100) + (50 + 10 + 10) + (10 - 1), ""M + CD + LXX + IX"", MCDLXXIX

1999 in therefor not MIM (1000 + (1000 - 1) since 1000 has the fourth number position while 1 has the first number position.

1999 is 1000 + (1000 - 100) + (100 - 10) + (10 - 1), MCMXCIX

990 is therefor not XM since X = 10 and M = 1000 and the 1 in 10 is on the second position while 1000 is the fourth position.

990 is therefor (1000 - 100) + (100 - 10) CMXC

so a few other numbers:

3698 = MMMDCXCVIII

2469 = MMCDLXIX

3999 = MMMCMXCIX

Now the only question I have is how did the Romans write 5000? 10000? 50000? etc...

because MMMMMMMMMMMMCMLXXII is very impractical when writing 12972..."	2	0

It's useful to start by thinking about how we handle writing whole numbers.  For instance, when I write the number ""273"", what I'm really writing is:

&gt; 2*10*10 + 7*10 + 3

Starting at the three and moving to the left, we keep multiplying by ten over and over again.  We say the the two is ""in the hundreds place"", the seven ""in the tens place"", and the three is ""in the ones place"".  Now, if we were using base twelve, instead of base ten, then ""273"" would be a different number:

&gt; 2*12*12 + 7*12 + 3

Now, instead of multiplying by ten over and over again, we're multiplying by twelve.  That's the entire difference between writing in two different number bases.

So, now let's start looking at numbers that aren't whole.  In base 10, we're used to the idea of of numbers like ""273.85"" as

&gt; 2*10*10 + 7*10 + 3 + 8/10 + 5/10/10

Just as everything to the left of the ones place gets multiplied by more and more tens, everything to the right gets divided by them.  We now have eight in the tenths place and five in the hundredths place.  We can do the exact same thing to understand a ""decimal"" number like ""273.85"" in base twelve:

&gt; 2*12*12 + 7*12 + 3 + 8/12 + 5/12/12

To understand what that means, we'll stop using such an arbitrary values and go to the example I used earlier:  what is 1/2?  In decimal, we can simplify the fraction

&gt; 1/2 = 0 + 5/10

So 1/2 = 0.5 *in decimal*.  However, when we switch to base twelve, we no longer care about dividing by ten - we want to divide by twelve.  Therefore, we go with a different write-up:

&gt; 1/2 = 0 + 6/12

This means that on half is 0.6 *in base twelve*.  If we take a more complicated fraction, like 5/6, and try to write it in base twelve, we find

&gt; 5/6 = 0 + 10/12

This is a problem, because we have to write ten in the twelths place, but it's two digits and we can only put a single digit there.  That's where we go with your complete correct assertion that we need extra characters.  If I wrote the above line in base twelve, it should truly read:

&gt; 5/6 = 0 + A/10

We're using the symbol ""A"" to represent ten and, since we're in base twelve, ""10"" means twelve, not ten.  Therefore, the fraction 5/6 would be written as ""0.A"""	2	0

If the blueprint is calling for the piece of steel to be bent at 90 degrees and the bend length to be 50mm long, then I do simple math to move it to imperial, where IT IS more accurate. 50mm / 25.4 = 1.968 inches. Now I also have a tolerance of +/- 1.5mm. Doing the same thing I can i can figure out 1.5 / 25.4 = .059  inches, so basically 60 thousandths. Now the press brake to be ran only uses imperial digits, so I have to convert. And being able to measure down to the thousandths and even then further down, is a lot more accurate than just using millimeters.	1	0

Because unless you are (or you're talking about similar schemes on older CISC CPUs), the computers and calculators that you **are** using to do your math are using base 2 (binary).

You seem to be under the misapprehension that being somewhat consistently base-10 means you can ignore units, but that is simply not the case at all. Even in hard sciences that use metric-based units throughout, you still often have to decide what scale to use.

For instance, the metric unit calorie is often defined as the amount of heat energy needed to increase the temperature of 1 cm³ (1 gram) of water by 1 degree Celsius. But the calorie is actually a [CGS metric](https://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/cgsmks.html) unit. The ""real"" (MKS) metric unit is the Joule, which is **not** translatable using powers-of-10 to the calorie.

Or in other words, not all metric units are base-10 conversions of each other, not does using metric free you from the tyranny of having to track the units on your numerical figures. You have to do unit analysis, there's no getting around it.

And since you're doing that *anyways*, plugging in customary constants (which are, after all, nowadays all defined directly in terms of SI units) is simply a matter of typing in different numbers to the calculator or computer that you're using to calculate your sums."	1	0

No, but I am saying the ""obvious"" difference between the two in practice is not at all obvious or large. If you want something to hang your hat on, you could suggest that metric makes mental estimates of the answer perhaps easier than customary units, which can help check your answer that you get from the calculator or computer you *will* be using for serious engineering. But I already mentioned that in my first comment, it's simply not that large a difference.

The kinds of things metric is **really** good at (converting from millis to base units to kilos) are the types of things we don't need too often (thanks to scientific notation where you can simply always write that something is e.g. 5.1e-3 grams). Meanwhile, the types of things that engineers have to do all the time with metric end up with non-round numbers just as much as they do with customary units.

For instance if you're a pilot trying to figure out how many liters of fuel to use for your aircraft, the conversion factor you use to convert kg to L is not going to be a nice power of 10, or even a round number. Nor was it for customary, which is my point: the same types of things you have to do for customary units in engineering still have to be done for metric. There's no silver bullet there, *particularly* for ""serious"" engineering."	1	0

If, on the other hand, you had 30=2 x 3 x 5, there are 2 x 2 x 2=8 (1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30) factors. 

Plus, the factor tree of the divisors of a product of distinct primes is a Boolean lattice.

The only reason that I think I'm getting more factors is that I am.  This is probably ny fault for not being clear, but it's obviously not just the number of factors.  It's the percentage of numbers between 1 and base.  If we make arbitrarily large numbers of course we can have more factors.  For twelve, the base is divisible by half of the numbers between 0 and the base.  For any base that tha is a power of two it would be better than half.  My math is shitty and I definitely can't describe this rigorously.

For 10, it's divisible by 2/5 of the digits between 1 and base inclusive.

For 30,  it's 8/30 or 4/15 which means base 30 would be worse in terms of being able to divide the base evenly by a digit (pretty sure I'm failing to use accurate terminology here).


I can't show it rigorously, but it seems to me that when constructing a base from primes, repeating a lower prime will always equally more factors between 1 and base.

So 2x3x5x7 wouldn't be as good as 2x3x5x5., it is possible I think for two bases to be the same.  But the one with the repeat can't ever be worse.

You have to add 2 new digits to each one's place.  Ten/Twelve is typically written as an upsidedown 2(ᘔ), and 11 as a backwards 3 (Ɛ). 

1/10 is 0.1, which you're thinking is 1/12, because 10 has become what we now know as 12 and there's 2 more digits between 9 and 10 now. You have to consider that in whole numbers, the ""10"" is introducing a whole new ones place, so you can't write 11 as 11 anymore as it denotes that you've moved up a place. http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--kiiabg_x--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_320/18bw7mtopk5pkpng.png

Personally I don't like these.  This is done because an upsidedown 1 still looks like a 1, though...  Really I think 10 should be a slash 0 or something like that, and 11 maybe 2 one's together but the second one canted to be a V shape? I don't know.

10*10 for example becomes 100, which is 144.  But then you run into complication where ᘔ is 84. But if you had 84 of something, it's what you know as 100 now, because you have to add 2 for every tens place.  That's simpler than solving the reverse, though. 8*2 = 16. 84+16 = 100. Pretty straight forward in that it's 8 dozens plus 4, but decimals became way more complicated and we would be reliant on calculators.

The group decided that, in future, new members would be limited to those with constitutional association with an existing Commonwealth member.[11]

In addition to this new rule, the former rules were consolidated into a single document. They had been prepared for the High Level Appraisal Group set up at the 1989 CHOGM, but not publicly announced until 1997.[12] These requirements, which remain the same today, are that members must:

accept and comply with the Harare principles.
be fully sovereign states.
recognise Queen Elizabeth II as the Head of the Commonwealth.[13]
accept the English language as the means of Commonwealth communication.
respect the wishes of the general population vis-à-vis Commonwealth membership.[14]

An IP address is a number, like a phone number, that indicates where on a network your device is. 

Your Xbox is connected to your wifi. A wifi router assigns a unique local IP address to each device, so it knows where to send data it receives from the rest of the internet. Imagine a mailbox for a large apartment building, the mailman has to put each piece of mail in the right box for each apartment. The Xbox needs its own IP address just like apartment renters need their own mailbox. 

The other piece of this is, routers assign IP addresses dynamically. So, it looks at all the devices that are online, gives them all semi-random IP addresses, and does all the work for you. If a device turns off or goes offline, it's very likely that the router will reassign that IP address to a new device that connects (like, if you stop using your mailbox, they'll give it to another person).

That specific message means that your Xbox knows which router it's trying to connect to, and maybe got a few signals, but didn't get far enough to do that IP address assignment step. It's possible that the router just doesn't understand what the Xbox wants, or refused to give an IP for some reason. Without an IP address, there's no way for the router to know where to send data to, and if the Xbox knows that it doesn't have an IP address, it knows it'll never be able to get signals from the internet. 

Instead of dynamic IP addresses, you can assign IPs statically (permanently). So, you can tell your Xbox to always use a certain IP, but if two devices ask to use the same IP, you'll run into far worse problems. So, usually, people don't care and leave it up to the router to sort everything out with dynamic IPs.

(Also note that IP address, for this explanation, specifically refers to local IP addresses. Your router has an external IP that is used to identify it to the rest of the internet, and it can be statically or dynamically assigned by your ISP).

The best thing to do here (if you can) is get an ethernet cable and physically connect your Xbox to your router. If you do that, you should never run into this issue. However, they're probably in separate rooms...

If this problem never happens with your other devices, then it's an issue between the xbox and the router. It could be that the Xbox is just too far away from the router, or there's something interfering with the signal between the xbox and the router, or that the network configuration is wrong on one or both devices. 

But, it's also likely that you just need a new router.

We perceive size not only as the angle subtended by the image on our retinas, but also the size of the thing in relation to other objects.

My Samsung G4 looks about the same 'size', optically, at 20 cm as my 50"" plasma does at ten feet. But my hand is about as large as the phone while the TV is wider than the component cabinet it is sitting on. So, context tells me the image is larger.

You don't want to get a tv that has too high of a pixel count if the farthest some one is going to be away from it will not benefit from it. All pixel ratios have their optimal distance, a point in which it no longer helps compared to a ratio down, and a point in which a ratio up would be better.

We start with regular old uranium ore. It's got a little uranium in it and loads of other stuff. It's too little uranium per cubic inch to really do anything.

Then we take out a bunch of stuff until like 5%-20% of our lump is actually uranium, and that's enough uranium per square inch to make a reaction that we can use to boil water to turn a steam engine and make power.

If we want it to destroy a city, we need something like 90% uranium.

But what's interesting to note is the timing of it. Going from 1% Uranium to 20% uranium means 20 times more uranium concentration, but going from 20% to 80% is just 4 times. So there's a genuine risk that if someone has 5kg of power-grade Uranium that they could quickly make 1kg of weapons-grade."	1	0

Atoms can only contain so many protons due to the relative strengths of nuclear binding forces. After a certain point, the nucleus becomes unstable and engages in either alpha or beta particle emission to ultimately balance itself out and become more stable. This is what happens in radioactive materials. They are emitting particles and/or energy to move to more stable states.	3	0

In the winter most plants go dormant and human farming activity is reduced, so there's less junk thrown into the air. This causes the air to be nice and clear instead of scattering the sunlight everywhere.

Wind interacts with stuff at ground level. Trees with leaves and plants on the ground catch wind and slow it down. When they die back in the fall, there is less to stop the wind.

Also there are cold air masses which blow quickly and can roll further south than in the summer, because for you, the sun in winter is heating the earth from a lower angle than in summer. In summer, the sun is overhead and heats the air more effectively, which keeps winter away."	2	0

Like many countries have rules for handicap accessibility. In many countries if a ramp or whatever isn't up to standards you call a particular department of the government and they come and make the business deal with it. In the US the department doesn't deal with most enforcement directly, and a ramp that isn't up to standards would be a reason someone that needed a ramp would be allowed to sue the company. 

That applies to a lot of things, in other countries the government would enforce the rule directly, in the US a company breaking the rule opens them up to being sued. "	3	0

There are both benefits and drawbacks from having such a system, but that's outside the scope of the question so I won't go into them.

As to why companies often lose, there's a few reasons

1) If the lawsuit is over a trivial amount, often the companies will simply pay it without going to court to save themselves the hassle of a protracted battle.

2) Even if they win, a lawsuit can drag a company's name through the mud, often causing them to look cruel and anti-consumer, so again it can be in the company's best interest to settle out of court and keep the details of the case from being public knowledge. For example, say someone sues a fast food restaurant for finding a bone in their burger. Even if he restaurant thinks they can win, since the person suing doesn't have proof, they don't want newspaper headlines reading ""Are you children safe? Lawsuit over alleged bone in [Restaurant] burgers!"" Instead, they will offer to pay a settlement that includes a non-disclosure agreement (preventing the accuser from publicly discussing any details of the case) to make it go away. "	3	0

Sometimes members of congress get involved but it is not the job of congress to deal in foreign policy.  They are responsible for creating laws, nothing more and nothing less. 

BB is also an elected pollination.  For many reasons he thinks there should be armed conflict with Iran over the nuclear issue.  Getting re-elected would be MUCH easier if the US were to OK armed conflict with Iran.  Obama, it seems, does not agree.  While he supports Israel he does not support conflict with Iran and instead would rather a negotiated settlement.  Basically, he wants to use talk not bombs... for now.

The republicans, in general, disagree with Obama.  Trick is that they are not president right now so they don't get a formal say in foreign policy.  Rather than sitting down and shutting up they invited BB to speak to the congress.  

It's a problem because the reason the president is responsible for foreign policy is so that America can present a united front to those on the outside.  Sidestepping this tells foreign powers that if you don't like what the US is saying, don't do anything, just wait till the other party is in power.  This obviously hobbles the ability to get anything done internationally. 

There is also another layer here.  The US has elections coming up and that's normally a very tricky time for foreign leaders.  You never want people to have the impression that a foreign power is attempting to interfere in a domestic election.  BB taking the republicans invitation seems to indicate that he would prefer a republican president.  That's interference in the US election."	3	0

How could there be a parking lot for the top story? Because they built one.

How could there be 2 parking lots on 2 different levels? Engineers figured out a way to build a structure strong enough to support cars, and put one of them on top of another.

There are some other species that function as a male for part of their life cycle and then function as a female.

Once a type of animal has split into two genders it seems rare for them to change back.

There seems to be some advantage for species to have separate genders as each can perform a different role. Also a female animal (and female genes) have different priorities a male animal(and male genes). There are **different evolutionary pressures** for males and females, because males tend to father many many offspring using many many small sperm(and generally less parental care) while a female is forced to expend more energy on a large egg and possibly more offspring care. Different strategies for spreading their genes and different selective pressure.

And remember: Evolution is a process, it cannot make decisions. Those that are more fit for their environment/circumstance are more likely to pass on their genes, but that does not allow change just because a change would be ""better""."	1	0

This is a nice and simple system, doesn't require the complexity of male and female parts, doesn't require mating mechanism, so it seems like a good system.  The problem with it is that let's say I get lucky and have a good mutation, how does that mutation spread to the rest of the population?  The only way that happens is for my offspring to out survive/breed the descendants of all other members of the species and supplant them.  Even worse, if you and I both had a good mutation (maybe even ones that would work even better if someone had both of them), there is no way for our population to end up with both of those mutations (besides them reoccurring at a later time), and only one of them will win out against the other.  Also, if I pick up a bad mutation along with my good mutation there is no way for my descendants to lose the bad mutation without also losing the good one.

Now enter sexual reproduction.  The big win here is now individuals of the species can swap DNA and recombine them in the next generation.  This is massively useful evolutionarily because we get to basically pick and choose the best mutations from whole species and they eventually get merged into all members of the species, as well as remove the bad ones along the way.  The cost is the added complexity we need to accomplish this.  This first version of sexual reproduction is likely to be hermaphroditic (all individuals have both female and male parts).  This gets into your situation you were describing where any member can mate with any other member.

So if hermaphroditic reproduction is so great, why would we ever move to genders?  Well there is a cost to every individual carry both genders.  Further, there are tradeoffs one needs to make.  Some genes might be really good for the male parts, but not good for the female parts, and vice versa.  So moving to separate genders allows us to drop some of the complexity from both the male and female members, but more importantly it allows us to optimize towards those roles.  Women are really good at being women, and men are really good at being men, and we don't have to compromise to be somewhat good at both.  The cost of losing out on half of our potential mates is real, but it's offset by the advantages of optimized genders."	1	0

What’s going on under the surface is that repeated rubbing over one area of your skin will create forces that cause mechanical fatigue of the epidermis. This fatigue causes a split in the epidermis that usually resides at the layer of the Stratum Spinosum. When these cells separate, hydrostatic pressure allows a plasma-like blister fluid to form in this space. This fluid is similar to blood plasma in that it has the same electrolyte concentration, but with a much lower protein level (serum) Should you continue the sadistic massage of your skin, the outer 3 layers of your puss pocket will break open, your salty fluid will leak out, and this portion of your epidermis will slough off. The resulting exposure to the last layer of the epidermis and the dermis itself (where your nerves are) is the red area that hurts like hell should you want to poke it with a stick!	1	0

In the fifth grade i read at a twelfth grade level. But if you heard me read out loud you would have though i could barely read. To this day i struggle to read out loud but breeze through books on my own (28 yrs old btw). You can also see it in an individual's writting. They will often have words like "" been"" that the ""b"" has two stems like it was a ""p"" at first but then the writter recognized their mistake and didnt bother erasing. The issue with dyslexia is that some students are allowed to use it as a crutch for not having to try hard. But i think that applies to most learning disabilities and behavioral issues like adhd.

However, it may be over diagnosed by physicians that don't specialize in the disorder such as pediatricians.  My daughter has ADHD.  She never had the 'H' part but they lump the disorders together.  Unfortunately, she was an average student and we didn't catch it until she started to self harm.  After multiple tests, it was discovered when she was 13 that she had ADHD which caused anxiety issues due to her frustration with her school work.  Turns out she has an IQ of 132 (superior), now has a 4.0 in high school and takes the AP courses thanks to a great shrink and a combination of meds.  I will always feel guilty that I didn't notice her struggles until she started to cut three years ago.  So, yes, ADHD is real and yes, it is over diagnosed.	2	0

Evolution isn't perfect. At some point, a mouse tried eating a scorpion, and a mutation allowed him to not die. He got nice and fat while all the other mice were hungry, so the gene survived. His babies and their babies enjoyed the same luxury, and boom, adaptation is occuring. So the encouragement you speak of would be the same evolutionary pressure that encouraged it in the first place. 	20	0

For example, in Mexico it's comon practice for construction workers to make scorpion shakes with orange juice every day ( they blend whole scorpions) in order to become immune to everyday stings. Anti venom is derived from every species original venom aswel, it's pretty fascinating. 	-5	0

In general, spiders actually have to try pretty hard to bite something, and the spider is probably dead pretty quickly upon being eaten. It'd be quite difficult for a spider to accidentally bite anything.

It's a bigger issue for predators of stinging insects like bees. If you look up videos of bee-eaters they actually bash the stinger off before they swallow them ([starts at about 1:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LV3iXXAyaM).

Other predators of venomous animals like secretary birds have incredibly thick scales on their legs that make it hard for snakes to bite them, plus they're  generally quick enough to stomp/peck snakes to death."	7	0

That may be one of the cooler pets I've seen in a while.  I have to say though, owning a tortoise has taught me how different reptilian function/design is from mammalian.  For example, if I pick up my cat and he wants to get away, he looks at me and howls plaintively.

The US government already has an email system in place that can be backed up and archived.  She went outside that system so she had complete control of it.  Now, she had her own staff turn over some of the emails to be archived and some 32,000 she had deleted before anyone could review them.  She used that email address and hosting server to conduct SecState business.  She decided, without the proper oversight, what would be kept and purged and we are supposed to take her word for it that everything is above board.  Then she had the server destroyed when the issue was pressed.  With all of that, taking into account that she has been embroiled in repeated scandals dating back to Watergate, do you honestly believe that there is nothing of interest to the American people in those emails?	7	0

- Most banks have 24/7 atm where one can dispose money

- Just recently, ATM able to make deposits, tranfers and credit payment are being introduced

- Given the use of web applications, nowadays, most of your bank transactions can be done using a device connected to the web

- Any doubt you might need to go to a bank, can be answered either by a phone call to their call center, or using their web consultant on their web page

Just recently, several gas station store in méxico, specially, the chain store Oxxo let you do cash deposit and credit card payment up on to 8pm, so, if you can pay the credit by web, the banks are closed and there are no ATM with deposit capabilities, you can always go to an Oxxo and make the payment/deposit there, and believe me, there's an Oxxo, on almost every corner of the city.

In Hermosillo, Sonora, you can find Oxxo not even 1 mile appart. Most of the time, theur face eahc other, as to let the driver you park on their way, instead of doing a U turn to reach it. Most like there's an Starbucks coffe shop in New York on corners facing each other

I have worked as a systems analyst for major financial institutions for 15+ years. After the bank closes, all transactions must now be processed. Deposits, withdrawals, loan payments, interest accumulated - on and on and on. This ABSOLUTELY MUST BE FINISHED BY THE TIME THE BANK OPENS THE NEXT DAY. Now, at the present time, we certainly have the technology to keep the bank open 24-7 and simply record the transaction on any day we wish - past, present or future. The ability to do this, however, is due to relatively recent advanced computing capabilities. In the past, 30 - 40 years ago, it would be imperitive to cease all transactions at a specific time in order to begin processing all transactions. This is pure speculation, but it seems very logical and reasonable that banker's hours in part was driven by this aspect of the business. Since these hours have been ""set in stone"" for so long, at this point it's more traditional that banks still use this timeframe.    "	1	0

If i remember it right, they use a big and powerful telescope, forgot the name of that telescope.

There is no way we could possibly know what an entire galaxy looks like as a singular place.

We can't actually see our own galaxy without being outside of it, which we still have yet to accomplish. The Andromeda galaxy looks like it has dual spiral arms swirling from its center, and for the most part we believe ours takes on similar form. As for the universe, we can really only comment on the observable universe. Since this is the case it can be perceived as extending equally in all directions, like a sphere. Is that the actual shape?

Let's say there are only 5 visible stars in the sky (Besides our own), and we know how far each one is from us and, obviously, which direction it's in. From there, it's not hard to figure out how far each is from each other (Through trigonometry) and from that, you can draw a simple map showing all 5 stars, plus our own sun. 

And, well, you can keep expanding this upwards. Add more stars, and you can get a clearer picture.

That's pretty much all their is to it. We've catalogued thousands of stars and we know each one's relative position to our own and that lets us draw a detailed diagram of where each is in our galaxy and that's how we know the shape of it.

Likewise, we can catalogue other galaxies too and use that information to figure out where ours sits."	4	0

If the details are too dim, you just use a longer exposure time, which allows more light in to the camera and more dim objects become much more visible.

This gets into various schools of philosophy, but there isn't such a thing as an objective truth (or, if there is, its not something that we can know) because everything we perceive is filtered by our own internal biases.  You see yourself through the lens of a lifetime of experiences, ideas, beliefs and heuristics; someone else sees you through a different set of those things.  This leads you to different conclusions about the same ""objective"" thing.

For example, I think my wife is the most beautiful woman I've ever met.  You probably wouldn't feel that way because my perception is filtered my my emotional attachment to her; your's would not be.  This would lead us to two different conclusions that both of us believe to be ""true"" and for each of us it would be the ""truth"".

So for your situation, that one person thinks you are ugly.  That is their perception of your physical form.  You are allowed to have a different perception and have that be ""true""."	2	0

But yes, you also perceive yourself differently than others because you are the most familiar with how you look. Ever had someone tell you your mom/dad/sibling/SO looks like someone when you totally think they don't? You have a larger set of criteria by which to judge, but the person saying your mom/dad/sibling/SO looks like so-and-so is going on a more generalized set of criteria.

You got lighter elements on the left and heavier elements on the right. Moving up on the graph releases energy.

Most paint actually comes to consumers and to contractors in two packages: one-gallon steel cans and five-gallon plastic pails. There's also steel quart cans and plastic quart cans.

There are several reasons for the choice of size and material:

First, *most* projects that homeowners perform use between a quart (painting a windowsill) and ten gallons (painting an exterior / most of an interior). Having a few container sizes that can accomodate those needs allows the manufacturer to stock and fill just those few container sizes. The plant I worked at filled one gallon and five gallon pails, and normally stores fill quart containers from one of those, but there was a quart container fill line setup that, as far as I know, was never used while I worked there — mainly because the factory was built just after WWII, and filled orders for oil paint then.

The second reason is because paint is *heavy*. The average five-gallon bucket of paint weighs between 55 and 60 pounds, depending on the ingredients; 5-gallon buckets of really-high-quality primer weigh a bit more, and 5-gallon buckets of drywall mud weigh close to eighty pounds!

These are close to the generally recognised upper limit on what an adult human labourer should be tasked to lift and move, repetitively, during a work day. Five gallons of paint is work to lift and move and carry, but it is possible, and not overly likely to cause injuries from strain.

Then there's the materials. Five gallon pails are high density polyethylene, I believe. They're strong enough to contain the paint and to stack up three or four high, so they can be put on pallets, those pallets can be stacked two-high on trucks, stored three-high in warehouses, with minimum loss of space. — The cylinder is the second-most space-efficient stackable container shape, after the box, but boxes are really bad at containing anything that might have internal pressure, and less strong at stacking than cylinders are. So the one-gallon and five-gallon paint cans help the product (paint) survive the trip from the manufacturer to the consumer. Paint's a little expensive, so no-one really wants paint they own to be wasted. Plus paint is hot when it is put in the pail and cools down to room temperature, causing a bit of vacuum — that vacuum would buckle or collapse the walls of boxes, which would badly affect their stacking strength — but cans are good at withstanding that slight pressure differential.

Finally, there's the fact that paint manufacture is a surprisingly low-profit-margin business. Most paint needs to be used in a relatively short amount of time, from the time it is manufactured, (within a year) which means that it is mostly manufactured close to where it will be sold and used. It is mainly used when certain weather conditions prevail (generally, in North America, this means summer). Manufacturing paint requires local skilled workers who have been trained and who work quickly and are available during production season. It's also a somewhat-dangerous job, working around machinery and chemicals and often in a very hot environment (oil paint and acrylic/latex paint are heated during manufacture and filling, to keep them liquid). This means that the people who manufacture most paint are seasonal skilled workers, in a union, with a living wage, insurance, health benefits, retirement plan, etcetera. Their workers are paid well, there's a significant chance of losing a batch of paint or part of a shipment because of accidents, and cheaply-made paint will, eventually, start to cure in the pail, so they have to gauge comsumer demand and forecast demand.

That means there's not much left over to research and develop new and exciting (and unproven) containers to get the paint from manufacturer to consumer. They're not broken — why fix them?"	6	0

It's been a long time since physical guitars, bass and drums have been the primary instruments in the majority of pop songs.  In whole genres (any dance music really, hip-hop and almost all modern pop) it is exceptionally rare to have guitar/bass/kit driven tracks.

That aside, they've become pretty ubiquitous for 'band' type music like rock, metal, blues, punk, indie etc for some good reasons.

Guitars are relatively cheap, portable, very versatile and can fulfil multiple roles.  A saxophone can play great melody lines, solos and riffs, but for them to provide effective harmonies you really need more than one, plus they're pretty expensive, take a fair amount of practice to sound good on, etc.  A guitar, on the other hand, can do all of that and more - you can play chords, you can do melodies and, importantly, you can sing at the same time.

I think the use of the bass guitar flows straight out of this.  You really don't have to learn much switching from guitar to bass (or vice-versa).

As for the drum kit, that's an interesting question.  I don't know a great deal about drums, I'd be interested to hear about the evolution of the kit."	15	0

The guitar and piano are the most common instruments capable of playing full chords - other lead instruments (think saxophone, trumpet, violin, etc) are only able to play a single note, requiring other band members to back them up to flesh out chords.  Of the two, guitar and piano, guitar is a bit easier to learn and to play simple chord structures, and it's much, much easier to travel with and set up.

The bass is popular for the exact same reasons as the guitar, except instead of a chord structure, it gives you a harmony, countermelody, and bass support.

The drumset is simply the most convenient way for one person to provide any percussion needed to keep a rhythm in various styles.  They're completely modular, meaning you can modify them with anything - tambourines, gongs, xylophones, whatever."	79	0

Simplified, music has a pulse and feeling. You can craft this pulse and feeling by combining percussion, strings, winds, brass, electronics, voice, and generally anything that makes noise.

In general, the concept of the 'three-piece band' is so reachable because it can cover the full range of musical components - a drum can provide beat, a bass can provide rhythm and tempo, a guitar can provide timbre and texture, and all three can be tuned and played in the proper pitch and key. Really, they all inter-mingle (they all can contribute to each of the components individually or as a whole). They are relatively easy to learn without having an in-depth understanding of music theory. Personal opinion, but I think its harder to apply strings such as bass/cello/violin or keys without having a fairly good understanding of how things like keys and chord progressions work together, while with guitar/bass you can get a way with a lot knowing power chords and having a few effect pedals. Not to look down on that, its absolutely an interesting way to play, but there is a difficulty curve there that might make the integration of other 'classical' instruments into the rock-trio setup a bit rarer. 

Even that is simplified - what can you do with drums, a bass, and a guitar to take it beyond vanilla sounds?? Electronics play a heavy part in a lot of modern music - guitarists and bassists can take advantage of various effect pads to distort and alter the guitar and bass sounds, while drummers can employ synth pads, automated triggers, or exotic instruments to expand their reach.

This might make it seem like 'modern' music is dominated by this setup - but I would suggest that this is more due to the music that you have available to listen to, or are generally attracted to. Exploring different genres, you would likely find a significant amount of variation in instruments used in music. Consider bands like Pentatonix, Big Fish, Tool, Daft Punk, so on and so forth. There are a lot of new and interesting 'sounds' used by both indie and mainstream bands that are arguably 'modern' in their usage of sound that is not really traditional in any sense. Moreso in indie in fact - I would go so far as to recommend looking more into indie/unsigned artists, as there is a wealthy of interesting musical styles there that I think better represent 'modern' music.

TL;DR There are a series of components that make up 'music' that are fairly accessible with the three-piece band.

Back around the turn of the century there were travelling bluesmen that went from road house to road house (the most famous and influential was probably Robert Johnson, and he came towards the end of the era). They played and sang by themselves, and had to travel around. The best instrument for that is the acoustic guitar, because it's cheap and light, easy to play, and you can sing along with it. 

When they got to the cities, blues bands formed using the cheap instruments they had... bass and drums. They can be moved from venue to venue without much hassle, and when electric guitar pickups where invented they allowed the instruments to get smaller (in the case of the bass) and could be amplified without a microphone. You could have three dudes play for hours, with minimal setup and tear down, the venue only needed to pay three of them instead of a whole band, and rehearsals and that sort of thing is simpler when you only have a few people involved. 

So convenience, price, and utility made the guitar, bass and drum set the staple of American music going into the 50s (ignoring big band and swing of jazz). "	3	0

If you aren't very familiar with instruments and/or orchestral composition, you might just lump all instruments in with each other.  Yea, sure a woodwind looks different than a brass, but an instrument is an instrument.............. right?  
  
Well, not exactly.  A lot of instruments are hamstrung by their allowable range, that is, they cannot possibly play notes outside of a certain set.  Think of the total range of a standard 6-string stratocaster guitar.  You can play damn near anything in the history of music with that instrument (at least some interpretation of it).  
  
Now take a bassoon, or a tenor sax, and attempt the same thing.  You won't have positive results.

Bass drum covers the bottom, toms cover the middle, cymbals and snare cover the high end. You can play them all sitting, as the bass and some of the high-hat action is foot operated. Older styles did not even have toms, a lot were just [bass, snare, high hat.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_kit#Beginnings) I wonder if that came about from the basic military marching band setup of snares, bass and cymbal.

I really think the answer is that the whole setup is very efficient and practical and allows a lot to be done with minimal equipment and manpower. Like anything that evolves, it does what it does because it works.

Unless you're Dave Matthew's Band or something playing live music means having instruments that will fit in the back of a full sized van, will survive fairly rough treatment,  can be set up and taken down by 4 or 5 guys relatively quickly without a lot of outside support,  and which will still sound good in venues that are wildly different accoustically.

First, you have the bass which is way down there on the low frequencies spectrum, however, it also covers higher frequencies due to its harmonics. Guitar can cover mids and high frequencies, also covering lower and higuer frequencies, also thanks to harmonics. And the drums are pretty much all over the place as well. Bass drum and toms can cover low and mid-low frequencies, snare is also within low and mid-low frequencies but it has an bright attack which can be around 4Khz ~ 6 Khz (roughly), cymbals cover the high frequencies.

Why am I focusing on this? Because with modern music and I'm not talking about recent music but turn of the 20th century, we tend to like more whatever covers the entire spectrum, whatever feels like a full sound, even though it's only 3 intruments. Anyone can do the test, listen to a song with only drums and guitar with no bass, and then listen to another one or the same one with the bass and you'll feel the difference. "	2	0

For example, the instrumental core of 16th-Century music was lute (similar to guitar) and viola di gamba (a bass instrument).  A keyboard instruments such as harpsichord or portative organ was often included to play the harmonies.  Tambourines and drums were also in use,  although intended for dance and war, being co-opted into general musical performance and finally into today's ""kit.""

Our modern instruments like acoustic/electric/bass guitars have more sound power, dynamic range, scale range, and versatility than other instruments that have fallen into lesser use - such as lute, banjo, mandolin, harpsichord, etc.  Percussion instruments have evolved for similarly practical reasons.  The same is true for the standard orchestral instruments, which replaced the viols, sackbutts, recorders, cornettos, hautbois d'amour, etc. from previous centuries."	1	0

Drums and bass are the essential pieces and whatever goes on top of that is frosting...I should actually say 'rhythm and bass'.  The truth is that the contemporary drum set is rhythmically arbitrary, but the particular setup of it is definitely a honed orientation for blues and rock music.  

Okay, so rhythm tells you what energy you're dealing with:  The more you subdivide the beat, the more energy there is.  The more you do ghost notes, and/or accent notes, the more groove there is.  Groove is tricky though, because it's about complexity.  Think of it like a language.  It can be good to use complex words to broaden your communicability, but if your just pedantically spouting out overly-long words constantly, you lose a lot of people (Jazz!  Not to say Jazz is bad, but it's certainly only for a certain tongue...er...ear...)   So you have to groove carefully.  I like this quote, ""People gotta dig your groove, you gotta dig your groove, and your band has to dig your groove...but if you dig too much, then your groove becomes a hole...no one can see or hear you in a hole."" 

Bass on its own is just thickness.  It sounds thick, it feels thick...anything with solo bass is going to be deep and heavy feeling.  Bass combined with rhythm tells you how to feel.  Rhythm gives you an energy, and the bass tells you how to feel about it, it gives the groove meaning.  

Anything on top of that is just frosting.  Guitar is a popular frosting flavor for a variety of reasons: 1) You can use the strumming to produce a limited amount of rhythm [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1GZC0GQKOA) or you can get creative and [go for a little more rhythm.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn4MGaS3N4)  Guitar is also far more accessible.  The only comparable frosting instrument is the piano, as you can give the sense of multiple voices better than guitar and you can also separate the bass out with piano better than guitar.  However, when you get beyond that and compare the guitar to other frosting instruments, the reason the guitar is so popular is because of its accessibility.  It's cheaper, easier to fix and more mobile friendly than a lot of other frostings.  In addition, every 12 year old boy wants to be able to play the guitar because of the image and the awesome.  So because of this demand, there are more places to buy guitars, so more guitars are bought, so there are more people playing guitar, etc etc. 

So, Rhythm and bass are essential, and guitar is just the most obvious and practical frosting.  Rhythm and bass are your cake, guitar is your vanilla.

Full Disclosure:  I am a guitarist."	1	0

A Jazz kit sounds drastically different than a rock kit.  But I don't think that's what you were getting at.  To answer your question, I think it has more to do with frequency range\dynamic.  It goes all the way from the bottom (Bass drum - low), up through the toms (low-mids), to the snare (Mid\high-mid) to the high hat (highs).  Cymbals... Cymbals are I guess mostly for accenting?  But then there's ride cymbals too... And a lot of rock has people playing quarters on the cymbals. I think that's a different ballpark considering size, thickness, and shape of the cymbal can change the sound so much.  I guess it's used as a filler sometimes, and an accent others.	2	0

But citizenship is a formal recognition by a country of ""you"" as a citizen of the country.  This means the rights of that country are awarded to you (notice how everything in the constitution applies to ""citizens""), e.g. you can vote, you get a fair trial, etc.

Nationality is less formal, and more of what country people ""feel"" they belong to, rather than a legal status.  For example, if I was born in the US and I'm an American citizen, but let's say my parents moved to China for my entire childhood.  I would still be an American citizen but if someone asked my nationality, I might say Chinese.  If my parents were ethnically Chinese-Americans, I might consider myself a Chinese person or a Chinese-American, even though I hold no Chinese citizenship."	1	0

There are also other things that can be done.  A lot of large networks run their own panels of viewers to double-check Nielsen's data.

You have the rise in fad diets (similar to the South Beach diets and plenty of others that have popped up in the past) - these are hugely influential because, inexplicably, a handful of high profile celebrities will try the diet and rave about it, leading to a huge influx of fans and others trying it. And when these people go to restaurants, it's easier for them to just say ""I can't eat gluten, I'm allergic"" than to learn the actual foods that contain gluten.

That's not to say that actual Celiac sufferers don't or don't need to ask about which foods are gluten-free. You'd be surprised by just how many seemingly innocuous foods have gluten in them, and on top of that there's the huge problem of cross-contamination. My friend, for instance, can get mouth sores and severe stomach pains for hours if a piece of bread so much as comes into contact with something she will eat. You can imagine how much worse being served food that had prepared on a surface with a thin layer of flour on it, or in a pan half-assedly washed that had previously had breaded food in it, would affect her.

Anyway, the fad diets lead to a bit of a ""vicious cycle"" in the sense that many of the obvious gluten-y foods to avoid are also generally not good for you. So people going gluten free will generally be eating healthier. Especially at restaurants, the majority of GF meals are salads, simply-prepared seafood or maybe chicken dishes, stuff like that. So people subscribing to these fad diets may in fact actually feel like it's working *because they're eating better*. That only reinforces the notion that either the gluten-free diet is the reason for the change in health, or that they have a mild form of gluten intolerance.

So not only do you have people claiming to be doing this diet because gluten's bad for you or gluten intolerance is a ""common thing"", you also have people naturally eating better because they're avoiding the easy pitfall foods that are obviously gluten-filled. The rise in ""I'm gluten intolerant"" or ""I have a gluten allergy"" is a mix of a few sources - laziness of the fad dieter to actually learn what's gluten-y, actual belief of the fad dieter that they have a gluten intolerance, and (and I know I haven't mentioned this) an actual increase in Celiac and gluten-intolerant people due to a very sudden and marked rise in awareness for the conditions."	2	0

You ain't no orphan there! But. think about it, the light you see from a star is a really, really long way away, and they're really really bright. A beam of light from a torch, stands no chance of being seen.

I mean, we do detect some really faint stuff (in both visual and non-visual forms) but it's usually emitted by massive objects.

Most of the time though (and in any real sense) your beam won't be 100% perfect. The edges will point ever so slightly apart, or will point together, cross over, and then point apart. When this happens over the course of the universe the light will spread out to essentially nothing.

That also depends on your perspective. Assuming the beam doesn't diffuse (it does), and you're in the path of the beam, then yes, you can see it. But you can't see the beam if you're not in its path, because the photons simply aren't traveling towards you. 

Try thinking of those green lasers in discos and whatever, places people go to dance and stuff. You see lines, right? Well, that's because air molecules get excited and re-emit light. You don't see the photons of the original beam itself. "	1	0

The term civilis here had the very specific meaning of ""Roman citizen"". The English term civil war was first used in 1651 to refer to the English Civil War. Since the 17th century, the term has also been applied retroactively to other historical conflicts where at least one side claims to represent the country's civil society (rather than a feudal dynasty or an imperial power).

The terms internecine war and domestic war are often used interchangeably with ""civil war"", but ""internecine war"" can be used in a wider meaning, referring to any conflict within a single state, regardless of the participation of civil forces. Thus, any war of succession is by definition an internecine war, but not necessarily a civil war. In modern geopolitics since 1945, ""civil war"" is also used in a loose sense to refer to any large scale military conflict within a single country (i.e. used as a strict synonym of the generic term ""internecine war""), creating terminological overlap with insurgencies or coups d'état."	12	0

However, vestigial structures can take on new functions.

How do you spell the spread made from roasted garbanzo beans? What else are garbanzo beans called? Do you know why Muslims call their god Allah? Why do Christians call their god Jesus, not Joshua?

There are countless ways to spell [Mohammed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_%28name%29). [Joshua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_%28name%29) is also an appropriate transliteration of Jesus. Hummus, hommus, etc.

Propaganda?  What sort of goal might the different names have?

Daesh is the Arabic word for their organization. ""Islamic State"" is possibly the best translation for it. But that would be like calling the United States of America, the United States. There are other Islamic States and other groups who claim to have similar goals. No, the newscaster is talking about the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Iraq and Levant is what ISIL refers to. The Levant being the area on the Mediterannean sea including and surrounding Syria.

They all refer to the same group. People who follow the news know that. ""Iraq and Syria"" is not a good name because their ambitions and troops do not lay just in those two jurisdictions. And ""Isis"" is a name, acronym for other organizations. What if you were named Adolph in 1933?

So for your TLDR: there are pros and cons to each name, every journalist and government worker has to look to their boss and guidebook for how to refer to the group. This is possibly a top level decision for company/departmental consisstency

That's a mouthful for English speakers. We initially translated it in a few ways:

* Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS)
* Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria
* Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)

The first one is a slight mistranslation. However, they were first active in Iraq and Syria, so it stuck. ISIS is a catchy name, already familiar due to the Egyptian deity.

The second one is the most accurate to the original Arabic, but most people don't understand what Greater Syria refers to.

The last is a more familiar noun: the Levant is more or less what they meant by Greater Syria.

Daesh is a transliteration of an abbreviation in Arabic of the original name. The organization itself finds it a bit insulting, so people love to use it.

The organization itself changed its name to represent a greater scope. They want to be called the Islamic State, which sounds like a legitimate state with no geographical limitation.

Generally, those who oppose them don't *want* to please them, or give them political legitimacy. So the old names stick around.

Edit: each news or government organization picks a standard to adhere to. The U.S. Government picked ISIL (it was the most accurate meaningful translation without legitimizing them as a state). Most news organizations picked ISIS because it is the catchiest. Most people reporting from the area who are Arabic speakers pick Daesh."	2	0

In Star Wars Galaxies, for example, there was an option to save all combat data, down to every single weapon fired and ability used in each fight, to text logs.

Some companies turn off or remove any kind of logging for the public versions of games, but have it enabled internally for their own testing. Sometimes the game has an option to log that's via a hidden command or requires another program running along side to see and record it. Some companies might be logging and uploading those files with out ever saving them to disk permanently. Some companies don't log at all, ever, for anything, and simply rely on internal debugging tools and test teams.

Most of our numbering system is Germanic in origin. (The French have a very different system for saying their numbers).

Here is the etymological breakdown for 1 and 2

#1
 
""One"" comes from the Germanic ""ān,"" which is related to the modern German ""ein.""

""First"" comes from the old English ""fyrst"". It is related to the modern German ""erst."" The Old English and Modern German both come from the High German word ""Fürst"" which kind of means ""first"" and also ""prince.""

#2 

""Two"" comes from the Germanic Old English ""twā"" and is related to the modern German ""zwei.""

""Second"" comes from the Latin ""secundus."" Latin gave rise to Old French, which the Normans brought to England, giving us ""second"".

In the trailer, Batman is suspicious of a previously unknown alien who was called out over global media by other aliens, to die, or have the planet killed. Said alien defended himself, and the world from a threat no-one had heard of before his arrival, and his fight caused trillions in property damage, and hundreds of thousands, if not millions of deaths.

Soon after this, some people considered him to be a god. Batman thinks many moves ahead, and could conceivably consider the aforementioned fight to simply be the opening gambit to attain god status amongst mortals. He had to check him out for himself.

 Batman sees Superman not as just the ultimate good guy, but as the most powerful being on earth. 
He looks at Superman and thinks what if he went crazy and decided to just wipe everyone off the face of the planet, who could stop him?  


The possibility of this happening scares Batman enough into always  having a plan for a hypothetical showdown. In all scenarios Superman would kill Batman unless Superman holds back, which he always does, or Batman takes him down before he even expects a fight in the first place.


TLDR; Batman sees Superman as a ticking time bomb waiting to kill everyone on the planet.

He's a boy scout, he's been doing good deeds with his power, but his dad raised him to never fight. Hence when he fights Zod, he gets his ass kicked many times, and is so clumsy that he destroys a city just fighting Zod. He doesn't have the skill or strategy to really fight. All you see in the first Man of Steel movie is him punching, throwing, and flying at Zod and his minions.

Batman is incredibly brilliant, and has trained himself to fight. And has decades of experiencing of fighting. And let's not forget he has billions of dollars to spend on gadgets and weapons to help him."	3	0

He destroys Wayne Financial (https://youtu.be/0WWzgGyAH6Y?t=47) using the armor Zod left on the LexCorp building in Man of Steel and possibly the remains of Zod himself (https://youtu.be/0WWzgGyAH6Y?t=119). He pays the Joker to taunt Batman about the loss of his employees (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WWzgGyAH6Y). He also pays mercenaries to pretend to follow Superman (https://youtu.be/0WWzgGyAH6Y?t=125). He does this in order to pit Batman against Superman, and it initially works.

But Batman is the world's greatest detective, and Lex Luthor can only muddy the water for so long. But it will be long enough for Lex to discover Kryptonite (https://youtu.be/0WWzgGyAH6Y?t=168), which he will use to capture Superman (https://youtu.be/0WWzgGyAH6Y?t=113).

The presence of the Robin Suit with ""Hahaha jokes on you Batman"" displayed in the Batcave is what is giving people this idea, as it is very similar to the aftermath of ADitF.

Likely, Affleck's Batman retired after Robin was killed (which may also get brought up in Suicide Squad, given that both Joker and Batman are in it) *way* before the events of Man of Steel, and is now coming back out of retirement to fight Superman."	3	0

This isn't the sort of idealistic Batman we got from the Nolan movies; instead, we've got old, grizzled, jaded Batman who has already dealt with the loss of Jason Todd, and as a result is a *mean* motherfucker.	3	0

It is a famous story that is technically non-canon. It, along with others, were a heavy influence on Batman's return to crime fighting in Nolan's ""The Dark Knight Rises"". 

Basically in the comic Superman is a boy scout for the government and will do whatever they say. Batman, coming out of retirement, starts stirring up the criminals in Gotham and in doing so makes the government look bad that their authority is being challenged by a vigilante. They tell Superman that they might have to send him in to take care of Batman and make sure he doesn't make an ass out of the government anymore. Superman warns Batman of this but Batman doesn't give a fuck because he's Batman. 

Eventually Superman is sent in to take care of Batman. He really doesn't want to fight Batman and he is holding back the whole time. Batman gets the retired Green Arrow to shoot a kryptonite arrow at Superman. Batman then beats the shit out of him and reminds him to ""stay out of his way"" and that he should remember ""the one man who beat him"". In all honesty it's badass as fuck. Batman then has a heart attack and ""dies"". Really he is fine and faked his death so that he could operate a Batman Inc.-like operation from underground. Superman hears his heartbeat at his funeral and knows that Batman is still alive.

Batman is my favorite comics character and I spend way too much money buying and reading Batman comics but Batman only won in TDKR because Superman didn't want to kill him. In most scenarios Batman will lose to Superman. Batman will most definitely need kryptonite to even stand a chance. And does the ""Man of Steel"" Superman even have a weakness to kryptonite? That was never established and I am kind of curious on how they are going to do that.

You have to pay interest on the loan of course, which is a disadvantage. If you borrow a lot relative to how much you earn, the lenders will start charging you higher interest (because they're less sure you're able to pay it back).

The big problems with a heavy reliance on debt come with economic uncertainty. If you lose your job or, for a country, if there is a recession and tax revenue decreases, there may no longer be enough money coming in to pay down the interest on the debt. This means you must borrow more, often at a much higher interest rate, to avoid defaulting. Depending on how much you borrowed to begin with, you might be stuck in debt for a long time, spending much of your income paying it back."	1	0

This misses one other, key way of getting out of debt: growing out of it.  If your economy grows faster than your debt does, then you can raise more in tax revenue without raising anyone's actual tax rates.

It's analogous to taking out a loan, then getting a raise at work.  What once may have seemed like a crippling debt is now manageable."	1	0

It's obvious that if you took the same amount of weight as the ship has in the form of a solid block symmetric cube, it would sink. So this therefore means the amount of water displaced by the cube isn't sufficient. 

If we changed the dimensions of the block to make it much wider in both directions, than it is tall, then we'd reach a point where it wouldn't sink (assuming water didn't get on top and increase its weight). So this is because more water is being displaced?

Itd still sink because it weighs more than the amount of water it can displace. What makes a boat float is all the empty space in the middle. You cant make a solid block of metal float no matter its dimensions. However if you curve that metal so that it takes up a large volume then you can. Basically its related to the volume not really the shape (Shape is clearly a factor in increasing the amount of water you can displace though. Wider ships can hold more wait than narrow ones.

Now where have I heard THAT phrase recently? Oh. Right. Iraq. The LAST place we were ""greeted as liberators."" Remind me again how THAT worked out...?

But there's really more reason than that that nobody is liberating NK: no government actually *gives a flaming rat's ass* about NK, except maybe South Korea, and they're too busy making money to start a war that would probably get tens or hundreds of thousands killed. NK doesn't have any oil or significant resources, so why should we care?

Oh, because their vile, oppressive government has enslaved the people and the oppressed masses cry out for freedom? Well, if you're waiting for the Awesome Freedom Peace Democracy Troops from the US to redress that, don't hold yer breath. The US is quite happy to not only ignore, but even create and support murderous dictatorships when it suits them. And that's pretty much the same for any other world power.

China takes it's northern land border very seriously, and spent $380 billion dollars to build the Great Wall of China along it's northern frontier to protect against the powerful Mongolian hordes. This northern land border threat has been a problem for thousands of years; it only abated with collapse of USSR in 1991 and peace treaties with Russia.

North Korean border is very very close to the Great Wall of China and Beijing capital (270 million people live in surrounding area), the most strategically important area in China is Beijing capital area.  The Japanese invaded China through the Korean peninsula, and MacArthur even suggested using Taiwanese ROC troops to reconquer China through Korea/Manchuria... this is unacceptable for China's leadership.

So it's natural to see that North Korea's DMZ is a defacto extension of the Great Wall of China against a powerful military foe (U.S.)

Another reason is because Korea has been a vassal state of China for thousands of years, so it's natural for China to defend Korea from foreign invasion (see Japanese invasions of 16th century, 19th century, and 20th century U.S. invasion)"	2	0

So, in a recent example, Google created a holding company called Alphabet.  Prior to this everything Google did was under the Google brand name.  Things like their self-driving car was as much Google as their search engine.

With the holding company each part becomes its own division and it is easier to see cash inflows and outflows as well as selling it off or closing it if they have to/want to.

Non-core business functions like HR, legal, accounting, etc. can be shared while the operations that may be very different can operate in a way that best suits them. For example, Amazon may have a very different method of operating than Zappos, and by trying to roll Zappos into Amazon's ways of doing things could kill what makes Zappos unique. On the other hand, Zappos may not need a redundant HR department to administer health insurance plans or lawyers to respond to trademark issues.	1	0

For example: *When the flag is suspended across a corridor or lobby in a building with only one main entrance, it should be suspended vertically with the union of the flag to the observer's left upon entering. If the building has more than one main entrance, the flag should be suspended vertically near the center of the corridor or lobby with the union to the north, when entrances are to the east and west or to the east when entrances are to the north and south.

If you hold your breath and put some food in your mouth, you're not going to feel the taste. But if you then exhale (without swallowing the food), you will start feeling the taste.

The basic idea is that deflation makes money more valuable. Which encourages hoarding. Why invest when you can grow your money just by waiting?

If the nominal interest rate is, for example, 3% but the inflation rate is -3% (or 3% deflation) there is no incentive to make loans. You profit just as much from simply sitting on the money as you would from lending it. There's also a disincentive to borrowing.

All conversations have a flow to them, and sometimes that flow momentarily dries up. Which means a brief pause or silence. It's only natural that those pauses will naturally sync every now and then. Not probable, maybe, but still very possible.

There are also two other factors likely at play here. For one, you're only remembering those instances where this occurs. You don't recall every time you're in a crowded room and the din *doesn't* fall silent for no apparent reason. You only remember the times that it does. There's a term for this phenomenon, but I don't recall it at the moment.

Second, humans are social creatures. We want to fit in, we want people to like us, and we want to be accepted or perceived as ""normal"". It's just how we are. So when we sense that the room is beginning to quiet, we *want* to conform on a subconscious level. It's why we applaud at a boring concert/performance, it's why we do the wave at baseball games, and it's why we laugh at a joke we don't really get.

All rooms have a volume level for the background noise. As the crowd chats away the volume level increase slowly, since individuals have to increase their talking volume to overcome the background noise. This will continue until the majority of the group refrain from talking (a pause in the chatter), and the volume of the noise will drop. Then the cycle will repeat.

If you become aware of the background noise you will notice its cycle and the drops to silence (compared to the peak of the volume). 

Most venues will manage this phenomena by adding music to the background noise.

Active neurons activate other neurons via their connection. So if you hear the words ""guns and roses"", the strong connection with the band guns and roses ensures that the band also pops up in your mind.

When trying to name a list of something, there may not be a quick road between the currently active neurons and all the neurons of the items that you do know.

It therefore can help to randomize what you are thinking about when stuck. Look around at all the words, people and objects around you, and maybe the neurons that represent these things do have connections to the neurons of songs you haven't listed yet.

It's basically a giant database for their project, which is to create every single possible combination of letters and punctuation on one, 3200 character long page (which they have accomplished). So, in effect, it has in its database every page from any book that has been written or could be written in English, which also means that you can assemble those pages into any book that has been written or could be written in English. The pages generated by the program are organized in volumes of 440 pages and organized into rooms with 4 walls of bookcases, five shelves per wall, and 32 volumes per shelf; the rooms themselves are given a hexadecimal code to identify them. The concept of the library is that the rooms are hexagonally shaped, so they have 6 walls with 4 shelves and 2 doorways that connect to 2 more rooms and it starts forming a pattern for all the space in the entire library.	1	0

This means that by putting different seeds into the equation, you can get a page that contains every possible combination of those 3200 characters, which is everything that could ever be written in english in 3200 characters. Because the equation also works backwards, you can put in a word, or series of words, and then it gets translated into a set of numbers, and the equation will give you all seeds (or pages) in which what you put in will appear.	2	0

Much more so than weight in the body of the car, weight on the wheels much both be brought up to speed going forward, *and* spun up to the tires rotational speed, which takes extra torque, which could otherwise be spent accelerating the car. Reducing 1 pound of weight from the tires can be equivalent to reducing 5-10 pounds of weight in the rest of the car.	1	0

They actually do this for some industrial vehicles, most commonly with skid steers. They're called foam-fills (imagine that!) and are very effective at low speed. However,  replacing these tires is time consuming, complicated and expensive. Often times its easier and cheaper to just toss the entire assembly and buy a whole new wheel every time you need a new tire. 

Also, and more importantly, the foam would simply disintegrate and lose structural integrity at higher speeds and harder impacts almost immediately. Then there's the minor detail that foam filled tires would be literally impossible to balance and would ride *terribly*. 

Maybe one day they'll develop a formula that works for passenger vehicles, but it's not a priority since air filled tires work just fine and are cheap, easy and mess-free to replace!

When you do get a flat the weight from the vehicle alone would squish it down anyway. If the foam is strong enough to hold vehicle up then it won't allow the tire to flex as necessary when you hit a rock while travelling at 100 km/hr. It is the same as for the bike only on a smaller scale (and velocity). Again, as people have stated, these tires do exist and their sole purpose is in industrial application where you you'll most likely never go faster than 30 km/hr.	2	0

Done? Good! Let's summarize what we found!

&gt; The word orange is both a noun and an adjective in the English language. In both cases, it refers primarily to the orange fruit and the colour orange, but has many other derivative meanings.

Welp, that doesn't have anything about the origins of the word :(. But fear not, it's only been one sentence! Surely if we keep at it, we shall find something useful!

&gt; The word is derived from a Dravidian language, and it passed through numerous other languages including Sanskrit and Old French before reaching the English language. The earliest uses of the word in English refer to the fruit, and the colour was later named after the fruit.

I think we're onto something here! ENHANCE

Here's the thing though. There's a difference between questions that have simple, straightforward answers (especially if the question can be reduced to ""yes/no"" or ""is A or B true"", as is the case here), and questions about complicated subjects that don't necessarily have good layman accessible explanations readily available in easy to access places - either because they are just complicated subjects, or they have to do with some recent development, or are fairly niche in their subject matter, or are simply questions that people haven't asked enough to the point where they'd show up on google. 

The former goes explicitly against the rules of this subreddit:

&gt; That means no questions that are just looking for straightforward answers

Whether ""orange"" was first used to describe the fruit or the color most assuredly warrants a straightforward answer and is therefore more suitable to a different subreddit (or indeed just google).

Democracy is a method of electing governments through popular vote. It's a political system.

Socialism is a policy of wealth redistribution by taxing the rich and supporting the poor. It's an economic system.

Social democracy is a combination of the two, a socialist government created by democratic means. Democratic socialism is an ideology that advocates creating the above.

Political parties and individuals typically refer to themselves as democratic socialists in order to distance themselves from the historical connections of socialism with totalitarianism."	3	0

(FUSION  or putting the atoms back together also creates energy but we cant yet control it in such a way to generate net positive energy). When you split an atom, the energy that was binding the subatomic particles is released. Typically you use this energy to generate steam to turn turbines which make electricity. Nuclear energy in terms of energy density blows all other alternative energy (and conventional energy) out of the water, but its not exactly renewable and its not exactly pollution free. There is only so much of the elements that we can use for fission on earth, but that amount would last hundreds of thousands of years at our current energy consumption levels. The bigger problem is nuclear waste. Nuclear energy certainly produces far less waste than fossil fuels by orders of magnitude and no emissions into the atmosphere, but the waste it does create is extremely dangerous and difficult to dispose of.	3	0

In the end, all sources of energy are nuclear. Nuclear reactions in the sun produce the sunlight for solar power and wind power.

There are long term projects designed to replicate these reactions on Earth. If we can learn to produce power with fusion reactions we would have unlimited power with unlimited sources of fuel. These are long term projects.

Present nuclear energy projects involve fission, not fusion. It begins with mining radioactive elements. Then the radioactive elements must be extracted and concentrated. This takes enormous effort. if radioactive elements are concentrated enough they can be used to make bombs. There are a lot of people I do not trust who might choose to make radioactive bombs. Maybe it is a good thing that it is so hard to produce nuclear material.

The radioactive material mined, extracted, and concentrated, can be used to make fission nuclear reactors which can produce more radioactive material, breeding radioactive material. They also produce a lot of heat energy which can be used to produce electrical energy without burning fossil fuel. This is the sweet spot for nuclear energy, production of electricity and possibly producing more radioactive fuel to be used to produce more nuclear reactors to produce more energy.

Eventually the radioactive material can no longer be used to produce more electricity. The reactor must be disassembled and the radioactive fuel reprocessed. There is a lot of radioactive material left, material which should be stored safely for thousands of years while its radiation dwindles away.

The mining activity and the storage phase cannot be regarded as pollution free. In the early days miners became sick from handling the radioactive ore. Modern methods would not allow that to happen again.

Construction of nuclear reactors has become very expensive. Sites must be chosen carefully to avoid Earthquakes and Tsunamis. The reactors must be constructed carefully to have backup emergency systems to shut down the reactor if it is needed. 

Nuclear power plants can be operated safely for years. France has done this. Other nations do this. Russia had trouble. Japan had trouble. There were problems with a nuclear reactor in the United States.

What this means is that small amounts of mass are theoretically equivalent to huge amounts of energy. A single gram of mass is equivalent to 8.988×10^13 joules of energy, which is a huge amount.

There are two methods of releasing energy from mass:

1. Nuclear fission, in which an atom is broken up into smaller atoms 
2. Nuclear fusion, in which atoms are fused into larger atoms

The Sun is powered by nuclear fusion, but current nuclear power stations use nuclear fission.

A fission reaction works by hitting the nucleus of an atom with a small particle called a neutron. This breaks the nucleus apart into two smaller pieces called the *fission products*, and also releases more neutrons and some energy. Those neutrons go on to strike other nuclei, which continues the reaction. The matter you start with is your nuclear fuel (typically we use heavy elements such as uranium-235), and the fission material you're left with at the end is the *nuclear waste*. Nuclear waste is typically radioactive (they emit fast moving particles that can be harmful).

The energy produced is actually used to heat water or gas, which in turn drives a turbine. The turbine can then drive an electrical generator to produce electricity.

To answer your question, the main pollution formed by a nuclear reactor is the spent nuclear fuel (nuclear waste). This must be contained and isolated, since it remains radioactive for a long time. Long-lived radioactive waste is kept in storage facilities deep underground."	1	0

We found these really weird kinds of metal called uranium and plutonium. When there's a lot of them around, they start to do all kinds of crazy atomic stuff. When there's enough, it explodes, but when there's less, it makes heat.

What we do is have rods of these metals, and we dip them in water. The deeper we dip them, the stronger the atomic stuff, and the more the water heats up. That water makes steam, and that steam turns a turbine. The water never leaves the system, it just spins through the turbines forever.

Over time though, the uranium gets 'depleted'. You see, not all the uranium is useful - some of it gets depleted in nature over time, even if we're not using it. We 'enrich' the uranium by taking away some of the spent uranium, and leaving about 20% 'good' uranium.

Once the uranium dips below around 18%, it's not useful for power anymore, but it's also a pain to handle. So we usually stick it in some lead containers and put it back where we found it. This is a risk because it's more enriched than it used to be.

Nuclear scientists are always working to solve this problem, and a lot of solutions exist. 'Breeder Reactors', for example, can use the low-enriched uranium and separate out 'depleted uranium', which is often used in making tank shells since it's had all the radioactive parts removed. The problem is that you could easily turn a dial on a breeder reactor to make weapons grade stuff, and so the meltdown danger is higher.

On the other hand, we have special kinds of reactors called 'pebble bed' reactors that can never melt down - but, we can also never recycle their fuel.

It leaves us with a catch-22. We can either eliminate meltdown risk, or eliminate nuclear waste, but not both. A lot of people will argue that the use of breeder reactors is our future - we have to risk more people getting the bomb and have high security against terror attacks, but it would be environmentally friendly. Others say that the risk of a spill from a containment facility is too remote to matter, and we should use pebble beds. The facilities are isolated, deep, and well shielded, and there hasn't been an accident yet (although their could be one in the future).

Still others say that nuclear power has too many risks, and that we should focus on other ideas. It should be possible to harness enough solar and wind power to make our society work if we can just build a better solar panel. Time will tell who is right, and what we can do."	2	0

If the nucleus were the size of a tennis ball, the electrons would be several miles away.  All the mass of the atom, and half the charge is in that small space.  Just to get a sense of how compact it is.

The atom's properties are dictated by the number of protons in the nucleus.  Radioactive fuel involves atoms with over 100 protons crammed together.  Each proton has a positive charge - so you can imagine how much pent-up energy is there with all those tiny magnets crammed into that tiny space.  It's actually so bad that the large atoms need lots of neutrons to space the protons out a bit, or the atom wouldn't hold together.

There are certain fundamental forces that hold the nucleus together against this electromagnetic repulsion.  How they work isn't important.  The important part is that those forces are at their limit in large atoms, so that a nucleus is a tiny wound up spring with a ton of energy that's just barley held together.

So.  If you fire a neutron at a big nucleus and you hit it, it's liable to explode - like magnets flying apart - splitting into several smaller nucleuses, and releasing a *ton* of energy.  

It also fires a bunch of its neutrons away... which can go and collide into *other* unstable nuclei.  The process repeats and now you've got a chain reaction splitting more and more nuclei and unleashing more and more energy.

The final part - recall how tiny these nuceli are.  So the chance of hitting one with a neutron is equally very small.  So if you have a group of atoms spread far apart, the neutrons that going flying durung the split are unlikely to hit any other atoms, and the process just dies out - fizzles.

If the atoms are all crammed together with conventional explosives, you can ensure the neutrons hit a lot more often - leading to more neutrons leading to more collisions, etc.  That's a nuclear bomb.

A nuclear power plant is a happy medium where you keep the large, Unstable atoms just close enough together that each atom exploding tends to only hit one other atom - resulting in a consistent, sustained, long-term release of energy.

We collect that energy by letting it heat water, and then spin turbines.  Ultimately nuclear power is just like a coal plant with a different heat source.  The heat source is energy stored really precariously inside large atoms.  We release it by detonating some of the atoms, which go on and detonate others.

But instead of dropping a mousetrap into a box full of loaded mousetraps - like a nuclear bomb, this is like covering the floor of a hallway with them, and triggering the first row, so they'll set eachother off but at a controlled rate."	1	0

Here we go. Not sure I can make it for age 5.

Imagine you are moving, and trying to pack your car with all your belongings. It's a tight fit. If you haphazardly start stuffing things in the car you'll quickly get to a point where you can't fit all your belongs. But if you put them in the car in *just* the right order, you can get them all in.

We call these ""combinatorial problems"" because the answer is some combination of moves or decisions. Put the guitar in first, wedge three books and two towels around the curves of the case. Then take the vase and...  you get the idea.

So we want to figure out how to pack your car. We could just try every combination, but that would take forever. If you only have 10 items there are 3,628,800 different ways to pack the car. We want a better way than just trying every combination until something works. 

So we represent this problem with a ""tree"". This is a data structure that we can use to keep track of decision. The top node is our starting point. If you have 10 items to pack, then the top node will have 10 children nodes - node one represent choosing to pack the first item, and so on. These 10 children are at what we call the first level. 

Each child at level one will then have it's own children. Take the node for object 1. There are 9 objects left, so it will have children numbered 2..10. Node two from level one will have children 1, 3, 4,...10. And so on.

Imagine the entire tree - it will be humongous, and it shows every possible packing ordering for your car. The tree will have 10 levels - one level for each packing choice. So you can start at the top node, travel down level by level, and record what node you visit at each level. That is called ""traversing the tree"". Any path you take represents an ordering for objects packed in your car. You could go 3, 6, 5, 2, 4, 1, 9, 8, 10, 7, for example. Or 9, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, well, you get the idea. Any possible packing order is represented by this tree. If this isn't clear, google ""tree data structure"" to visually see what I mean. 

As I said, we don't want to try every combination because that will take forever. Maybe not for 10 items, but this BB is used for things like chess, scheduling ariplane flights, and so on. It would take until the heat death of the universe to try all the combinations.

So in practice we cannot even construct this tree. No computer has enough memory or time to do it all.

Okay, finally, the algorithm. We generate the tree bit by bit. We start with the top node, and generate all of the children. 10 in this case. So far the tree is small, and that didn't take much time.

Now what we do is assign a ""cost"" to each node. The cost is an estimate for how likely this choice is to lead to the solution. Normally we use smaller numbers for ""better"" or more likely to work. 

So let's say items 1 and 3 are really big. Suppose that if you put 1 in first, and then 3, the door opening is completely blocked and you can't get anything else in. So the node for the traversal ""1, 3"" (by this I mean object 1 at level 1, object 3 as the child of 1 at level 2)  would have an infinite cost - you can't pack your car because you can't get anything else in.  There are 40320 children under the node at ""1, 3"". It must be true that their cost is also infinity - none of them can lead to a packed car.

But we don't want to create a big tree, then have to mark 40320 children with an infinite cost. What a waste of time. and this is a tiny problem. Big problems like chess or go might have 10^9745342 children, which you can't store in a computer's memory, to say the least .

So you create the tree a few nodes at a time. First you'd make level one, and assign costs for all the nodes. Then you choose the node with the least cost and expand  the nodes (create children) under it. Maybe the node with the lowest cost is node 3. So you create children ""1, 2, 4...10"" under node 3 at level two. There are nine choices for the next item to pack, so there will be 9 children  Now you assign costs to all of them. We only have 19 children in total in the tree (10 on the first level, 9 on the second). 

Now look at the costs of all ""leaf"" nodes (nodes with no children yet). Select the one with the smallest cost, and expand that node. Compute the costs for those new nodes. Select the leaf with the lowest cost, and expand it. Pretty early on you will be expanding ""1, 3"", which I said led to an impossible packing situation. So you would ""prune the 3 node by giving it an infinite cost. This means that you will never expand it because all other nodes will have lower costs than it. This keeps you from exploring parts of the tree that can never lead to a solution.

You just keep taking the node with the lowest cost, create its children, assign costs to each, prune any that can't lead to a packed car, and then selecting the node that has the lowest cost and expanding that.... until you get to the solution.

BB doesn't always work well, but sometimes it does. 

Now, far from age 5 territory, there is the issue of ideal vs estimated costs. We normally don't know the real cost for a node. How can you say what the cost of putting your guitar in the car first is? The only way to find out for sure is to expand all of the levels under that node to see what results it leads to. And, that is exactly what we are trying to avoid!. So we usually use a estimated cost function. If we can guarantee certain properties about that estimate relative to what the true cost is, the algorithm is still guaranteed to work. That's beyond the scope of this subreddit. 


That feels too wordy, it's much easier to do this with a whiteboard. Sorry.

IIRC, Genesis begins with the Hebrew equivalent of ""once upon a time"" or ""it was a dark and stormy night."" So the explanation is that if someone from the intended culture (Jewish) heard that, they automatically realize this is a fable/parable/myth meant to impart knowledge.

Anyway, on to the genetics. Basically, incest can ""draw out"" any hidden flaws in your genetics. As an example: if you put sheet rock (normal) and a clear piece of glass (mutation) together, you still only see the sheet rock. You need both pieces of glass (mutated) to be clear if you want to look outside.

Genes sometimes randomly mutate as they get passed on. This might be because a mistake was made by our bodies mechanisms when copying some part of DNA, or something like sunlight damages the DNA, whatever. But our bodies are very good at catching these mistakes, they have to be, so they're very rare.

The chances of you having kids with someone who just happened to have the exact same mistake in the exact same spot are astronomical. But again, our bodies mechanism for copying DNA is usually *very* good. You have a ~50% chance of passing on that exact flaw to any of your own kids.

If you decide to only have kids with only your own children from now on, your chances of picking someone else with a flawed allele (copy of a gene) just shot up from below 1% to almost 50%.

But if you *don't* have any recessive mutations hidden in your genetics, nothing will happen."	1	0

* Corruption - no it is certainly not all corruption. Reddit absolutely loves to bang on and on about politicians being corrupt but by pretty much every independent measure/index the US (and most of the West) rates as a low corruption country. See [here](http://www.transparency.org/cpi2014/results).


* Quantify dumb - what makes you think they are dumb? Of the 112th congress 94% have a bachelor degree level education or higher (74% hold a higher qualification). 82 have masters; 23 have doctorates; 22 have medical degrees. Basically congress is, in general, significantly more qualified than the average person in the US ([source](https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43869.pdf) - see page 4)


* Why they come across as dumb - politicians are rarely given time and soundbite space to give eloquent and length speeches. They are generally required to simplify down very complex policies and arguments into short soundbites because for the most part that is all the media has space to report in the main headlines/news. As a result they need to present policies that a wide range of the public can quickly understand the concept of so they will tend to state comments that are much more black &amp; white/definitive than the perhaps more nuanced reality of a situation.


Basically - whilst there are doubtless dumb politicians and there are certainly politicians promoting policies I (and many others) would consider stupid/inept, the vast majority are intelligent, sensible people trying to bring about positive change in the world [even if their idea of positive change is not aligned with my own]."	5	0

A lot of choices they have to make aren't as easy as they may seem at face value, there are rules and laws that can make life difficult, there are always different groups with different interests that you have to satisfy, there is a lot of pressure from the outside, politically and economically. And probably even more stuff that I can't think about right now.

What we personally believe is mostly formed by how and where we grew up, our socioeconomic status, our environments, etc. So what might seem dumb to you, might not seem that way to others.

Voters vote for what they think is the best, but mainly what is best for themselves.

Sometimes politicians end up having to make choices that will displease a large amount of the population, but they have to do so because at the time it is the best solution available to them. 


If you meant the presidential election in the US, well that's probably a totally different ball game.

When we're talking about multimillionaires, it's almost a foregone conclusion that we're also talking about people who (1.) own and operate their own businesses of some kind and / or (2.) make investments.

It takes money to make money. Think of it this way: If I had a million dollars and wanted to turn it into ten million, what's the quickest way to do that? I can invest small fractions of that million, build it up over a period of many years (taking some losses along the way, but nothing that will bankrupt me). By the time I'm old and gray, I'm a little richer.

OR, if I wanted to make money quickly (it's human nature, right?), I could invest larger amounts of it. I could make riskier investments with a greater upside if I win (but a bigger downside if I lose). I could go in with other people. I could leverage my house, my car, my personal assets. In fact, if enough of my investments go sour, I might *need* to leverage those things just to pay off other bad debts.

The worst of it didn't happen in that the electricity from the wires didn't travel through its heart and kill it instantly. Not trying to sound mean if that's the way it sounds. But there may be some underlying damage like something neurological so it's best to just take it to the vet to get the cat checked out.

So onto the wires. In most houses runs what's called AC electricity. AC stands for alternating current (as opposed to direct current (DC) that runs in batteries). The flash of light you saw was the electricity shorting out, or temporarily connecting two or more wires that aren't supposed to be connected, so it makes a flash of light (think like lightning) when the electricity discharges, or goes to ground. That's basically the gist of it, if you want to know more like why electricity goes to ground, etc. Let us know. :)

It would not be surprising if this burnt her mouth a bit.
   
But with most computer power cords, the only 120V is where it is plugged in.  The cord usually has the voltage that the computer uses, something like 18V (or whatever your Mac uses).  Well, OK, that's not really true.  
   
You have the 120V plug, which goes to a transformer brick, which outputs the lower voltage, which goes in a cord to the computer.  Some power cords have the brick in the middle and a cord going each direction from the brick.  Some don't have a cord on the 120V side; you essentially just plug the brick into the wall outlet.  Again, I am not familiar with yours.  But that cord doesn't look like a typical 120V power cord, it looks like a low voltage cord.  
   
But even if it had been 120V, biting into a cord won't necessarily kill you, it just gives you one hell of a jolt.  You can also get a hell of a jolt from a lower voltage, particularly by introducing it to your wet mouth. 
   
When she bit into the cord, she reduced the area of the wires in it, and let some saliva bridge the power wires.  So a lot of current got to flow through thin wires and saliva.  Since the wires were thin and saliva isn't a very good electrical conductor, there was a lot of heat that went along with this current flow.  Something vaporized in a very short time.  Not really an ""explosion"", but kind of similar.  
   
Now I don't know if cat saliva will liberate light when vaporized in this fashion.  Metals certainly can.  They basically go into a thermal runaway in a very short period of time.  
   
Since the metal is thin, it has high electrical resistance, which causes heat.  The heat causes the metal to melt, increasing the resistance, increasing the heat. The metal starts to rapidly evaporate, increasing the resistance, increasing the heat.  This is what is known in engineering as a ""positive feedback loop"", and positive feedback isn't good when you are an engineer. Eventually some of the thin metal gets really really hot and briefly glows, as hot things do. It glows very brightly for a very short time.  We call this ""fusing open"", and it is usually accompanied by a bright burst of light.  It is what happens sometimes when a light bulb burns out.  
   
Again, I don't know if saliva has a similar way to liberate light when it gets really really hot.      
   
In any case, relax.  If your cat was going to suffer serious ill effects, it almost certainly would have happened right away.  There are few possibilities for delayed reactions to getting an electrical shock.

If your cat has chewed on this enough to expose the copper inside and survived as you described then it's likely two of the wires have been damaged very close to each other.

No. This is [an idea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullification_%28U.S._Constitution%29) that's been popping up since the 1790s. It gets smacked down every time it rears its ugly head. 

&gt; Does a SCOTUS ruling mean states MUST follow their rulings? 

Not all Supreme Court rulings affect the states, but States must follow the ones that do. For example, in 2003 the Supreme Court struck down Texas's anti-sodomy law as unconstitutional (a violating of the right to privacy). In the process of striking down that law in Texas, they effectively struck down all anti-sodomy laws at all levels of government in the country. (Reason: Let's say after the Texas anti-sodomy decision, someone was arrested for violating Georgia's anti-sodomy law. All he would have to do is file a federal appeal and a federal appeals court would strike down Georgia's anti-sodomy law) "	1	0

Technically it was not a court ruling. Roy Moore issued it as an administrative order (e.g, he was not speaking as a judge, but in his personal capacity as the chief administrator of the Alabama courts).  

&gt; Are they now committing any crime by ignoring a higher court's ruling?

Any clerks who follow this order are violating [29 USC 1983](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983). They'll get sued, lose in summary judgement (where the court takes a look at the defendant, laughs, and says ""you lose"" without the need for a trial), and have to pay the plaintiff’s legal fees.

1. Issues a decision that is explicitly binding on the parties to the specific case that they decided; and
2. Creates a precedent that applies to all other courts hearing cases that are sufficiently similar to the specific case they decided. 

There's a loophole in that second point. In areas of the law that are complicated or subtle, it's quite possible that a lower court might say that ""this case isn't *exactly* like the case SCOTUS decided, so we can decide differently.""  And such cases will inevitably be appealed, and a higher court will either agree that the lower court was correct in not applying the precedent in that case, or they'll decide the lower court was incorrect. But there's nothing wrong in the lower court doing that. They're expected to be adult and professional about it, and only invoke this process when they have a legitimate point. They certainly can't be held in contempt of the Supreme Court for raising an honest issue, even if it's really subtle. 

But in this case, as another poster said, they're being childish and petulant. It's like little Jimmy saying ""but teacher told me that was against the rules"" and little Johnny saying ""she told you, so it's against the rules for you, but she didn't tell me so I'm allowed.""  It forces someone to appeal the case to an appeals court, just so stubborn little Johnny can get his own personal court order with his name on it, telling him what to do.

Canada’s economy is highly tied into the price of oil, as we are oil exporters. So if the price of oil goes down, the value of our money goes down as well. So here is the tricky part, we import a lot of oil too from Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, and etc. so when we change out money into Saudi riyals to buy their oil, it costs more to buy their oil thus costs more for consumers.

Oh so lets just not export as much oil and keep it in Canada to reduce costs, right? 

Well too bad because there is no pipeline from the Alberta Tar Sands to the refineries on the east coast of Canada. 

Oh so let’s just refine the oil in Alberta and ship it to the rest of Canada?

Transporting gasoline across thousands of km or miles (for any Americans or Libyans reading) using trucks is extremely expensive.

Oh so let’s just build some new pipelines?

Yeah but First Nations people and the entire province of Quebec don’t want any pipelines going through their land and you can’t really get to the Maritimes without going through Quebec first.

Even if you get the price of oil and the cost of refining/transporting it the major players in oil (Exxon, BP, Shell) most likely have deemed it more profitable by keeping the price of gasoline roughly where it is as lowering the price won’t really increase demand for gasoline that much.

TL;DR = This is the reason I didn’t go into economics.

&gt; The only kase in which ""c"" would be retained would be the ""ch"" formation, which will be dealt with later. 
&gt; 
&gt; Year 2 might reform ""w"" spelling, so that ""which"" and ""one"" would take the same konsonant, wile Year 3 might well abolish ""y"" replasing it with ""i"" and iear 4 might fiks the ""g/j"" anomali wonse and for all.

English may not not be a Romance language, but it takes influences from Latin (the alphabet we use pretty much is the Latin alphabet) and actual Romance languages. So I would say that U after Q probably did not develop as a rule, but rather as an unwillingness to reinvent words.

Also, Q does have an actual function without the U in English. Burqa and Qoran are in fact anglicized words of their Arabic counterparts, they just happen to be frequently spelled with a K due to similarities in pronunciation. But, the Q does represent a different sound present in Arabic (and other languages) that English does not have, as the wiki article you linked to mentions. So our K does not actually represent the sounds used in those words and the Q helps make this distinction clearer."	2	0

You're spot on. It's called a ""split diopter/dioptre"" filter that attaches to the front of the camera lens, and has a roughly analogous effect on the cameras lens as set of bifocal spectacles do on a human eye. As you say it was very often used in the 70s.

The trouble with using this technique is that because, as you say, it's very much an in-camera effect, the shot has to be carefully composed to not have distracting things like an actor's limb that's half in focus and half not (exhibit A: Star Trek The Motion Picture). 

So by necessity, shots that use this tend to be quite static; it doesn't allow for much movement. 

It came about really because in the seventies, film technology was at a much earlier stage than it is now. Film sensitivity was relatively poor, so in order to give the film enough light to allow you to use a fast enough shutter speed to achieve nice sharp pictures (and not motion blur), the only solution was to widen the aperture (the artificial iris inside nearly every camera) to let more light in. 

I don't know if you know about aperture and all that so forgive me if this is a waste of text. Suffice it to say the wider your aperture the narrower the range of distances in front of the camera lens that are acceptably focused at a given focus setting are. Normally known as your depth of field. 

You can't close your aperture to widen the depth of field, because the film's sensitivity isn't good enough, so that gives you two options. 

First is the Soap Opera standard configuration of two people at the same distance from the camera, perhaps angled slightly towards it. 

Or, you use some external method to artificially simulate a wider depth of field. 

Enter stage left, the split dioptre attachment. 

Fortunately, things have moved on so aside from very specific directorial choices for a shot, they're not really relevant any more. "	2	0

Just 1/2 inch to the front or the back and the actor in the foreground would be out of focus....must have been hell to shot those scenes.

I don't want to go into all the political consequences an invasion would have because I know nothing about that.

It's largely seen that invading Iran would be catastrophic to any attacker.
First, Iran is a huge country which is in part terrible to access (mountains and deserts). Second it does in fact have a pretty big military. Third, the people would very likely be against an invasion because they're very proud of their country and because they have really bad memories from the past when the ""Western world"" mixed into their politics, causing the revolution and on top of that a huge war that cost countless lives and screwed the entire economy. So you shouldn't expect the population to be supportive to any country ""freeing"" them by any means. And unless you want to achieve WW2-like destruction you need the support of the people to succeed.

Look at Afghanistan and see how everyone fails to secure the country. Iran is three times bigger and has more than twice as many people apart from Afghanistan being completely in shambles.

I think that nobody could successfully invade Iran without nuclear force. On top of that you really don't want to destroy one of the most stable and economically powerful countries in an already terribly unstable region."	2	0

In turn, they switch to asymmetric warfare, in which they have in fact become efficient. Like proxy wars they have caused to keep US and allies distracted in Syria, Yemen, and to some extent Bahrain.

And Iran is a very Huge country with a big, jingoistic population, and one does not simply invades such a country. They have ~2 million ground force and ~5 million more trained militia. They have decent diplomatic relations with European countries, which make it improbable for US to form a coalition. Also Russia and China have reserved an sphere of influence over Iran and it's not realistic to think they would sit out an invasion on it, which would bring in Vietnam and Japan and there's your WWIII. And that's not considering the economic backlash it would create inside the US.

Iran has always denied the allegation that it wants a nuclear weapon. And I think so, they don't want to build a nuclear bomb, they wanted the option to create one just in case the US was thinking of invading them. And US politicians use this proclivity as grounds for Invading Iran. That what you get when you fail in communication.

Iran has a large military, but its isolation means large parts arent exactly of modern gear, even purchases from Russia are not universal, as Russia has been trying to dig themselves out of a 2 decade hole. 

So they would do better than 2003 Iraq, but even in 1991 Iraq with the 4th largest army in the world(though very uneven in quality) melted away before a Western force. So we can say it would be bloodier than 2003 or 1991, but the end results is probably not in doubt, just the timetable.

They didn't have writing of their own, so they borrowed the only one available to them. Moreover Italian, French, Spanish and Portugese are all derived from Latin so it would be natural for them to use Latin letters. And, after the Roman Empire became the Holy Roman Empire and printing became known, the Roman alphabet was used to print Bibles. (Although many people call them Roman letters, that's not completely correct. The Romans only wrote in upper case. The lower case wasn't mixed with upper case until much later.) So, this is why most of Europe uses the letters. 
As for the rest of the word, most languages in the world never developed a written form. When missionaries went to various parts of the world to spread Christianity they would use Latin letters to represent the various languages they came across. The more Europeans explored the world, the more illiterate societies they came across that needed a writing system. Naturally they just used their own instead of thinking up a new one. 
Most places that had their own writing system never bothered to switch to the Latin alphabet (Vietnam and the Philipenes being rare exceptions). However, all languages can be written in Latin letters if needed. This is most likely for convenience when dealing with western countries who have all the money. Also, since it is alphabetic, it is much more versitile than most writing systems. (e.g. You can write Japanese in Latin letters and get the same result, but if you try to write English with Japanese kana it is barely understandable) And yes, as others have noted most Eastern European languages use the Cyrillic alphabet derived from Greek and Hebrew and is now wide spread over any place with heavy Russian influence. 
So, your second answer is closest to correct except that missionaries and explorers weren't necessarily English speakers, but were probably from Europe. And, Europe itself inherited it from the fallen Roman Empire.

Alphabets refer to systems where each letter represents a unique sound. Systems like Chinese use characters (logograms) which represent a word or phrase. There are also syllabaries where each symbol represents its own syllable (e.g. the Cherokee ""alphabet"" is actually a syllabary) 

Without repeating too much, alphabets are similar because all modern alphabets originate from a single one - [the Phoenician alphabet.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenician_alphabet#Spread_of_the_alphabet_and_its_social_effects) Many societies encountered the  Phoenicians, as they were the dominant (sea-based) traders of their time. With contact, alphabet systems were widely adopted, as they were much easier to learn than symbol-based languages (e.g. hieroglyphs). You only have to learn ~30 symbols, whereas systems like Cuneiform required a lot more. 

Using the Phoenician system as a base, societies developed similar alphabets (e.g. Hebrew, Aramaic, Coptic, Greek). Over time, these diverged due to various geographic and historical events. The overall similarity between modern alphabets reflects the degree of contact between societies throughout history. Aramaic would give rise to Arabic script. Latin (through Old Italic) and Cyrillic are derived from Greek. It's also believed that modern Indian alphabets come from Brahmic scripts which were based on the Phoenician. 

This gives rise to the modern patterns. Western European alphabets are Latin-based because it was the official script of the western/Catholic Church, spreading from Italy. Eastern European alphabets are Cyrillic-based because it was the script of the eastern/Orthodox Church (outside of the Greek-speaking Roman/Byzantine Empire) through the Bulgarian and later Russian Empires. The story is similar with other alphabets. "	1	0

They need the extra strength to move.  It's a waste on cars because they really don't need it. For a little more in-depth explanation check here. I'll post a reply from there. 

http://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/23865/why-do-heavy-vehicles-almost-always-use-diesel-engines
""Torque is the name of the game. High torque is needed to move heavy loads. If comparing a gasoline engine to a comparable diesel engine the diesel will always have higher torque. The higher torque comes from the need for a higher compressing ratio needed for compression ignition. To achieve the higher compression ratio a longer stroke is required. The longer stroke comes from a greater crankshaft offset. This offset gives greater torque.

Another aspect is that diesels can make tremendous torque at very low RPM. Very simply put more fuel equals more torque when everything else is kept the same. A diesel does not have throttle plates and draws in the maximum amount of air on every stroke. In a diesel the amount of fuel added is what controls the power. The throttle controls how much fuel is added. This means that a diesel always runs lean. At idle the engine uses hardly any fuel. This lean mixture allows for the addition of large quantities of fuel even at low RPM. A gasoline engine on the other hand always has to keep the fuel mixture at optimal stoichiometric. This need to keep the mixture correct means that to get more fuel the engine needs to rev to higher RPMs. This means that a gasoline engine makes it's torque at much higher RPM than a diesel. This high end torque characteristic makes a gasoline engine hard to drive necessitating constantly keeping the RPM high.

The only real draw back to this torque production is a limited RPM. This is compensated by a gear box with lots and lots of gears.

If a gasoline engine was used it would have to be much larger. The much larger engine would make for greater fuel consumption."""	11	0

The ""engineering-via-accountancy"" approach that ruined GM's image for many couldn't be better exemplified than the Olds Diesel.

To keep costs low while entering the diesel market for an end-run around emissions standards, GM rushed a small block diesel to market. They took the Olds Rocket 350 and practically unchanged, converted it to diesel. They were so rushed that the casting for the blocks weren't even complete and the cranks weren't balanced well, which as you can imagine that's probably no good. They used the same head gasket setup as the gas Rocket 350, which predictably failed nearly immediately. Designed for 8.5:1 compression and now being submitted to 22:1 or thereabouts obviously caused that failure. Like, within 30k. They were too cheap to include a water separator, standard kit on most diesels since forever and absolutely necessary with the quality of highway diesel in America at the time. Pair that with some of your more typical GM quality control issues at the time and these cars were some of the worst ever produced anywhere by anyone.

You couldn't talk about a diesel vehicle to anyone in 1985 without comment about the GM passenger car diesels coming up, and after they shitcanned it we haven't seen an American car company make a serious effort at a passenger car diesel until very recently.

Say what you want about Mk1 1.5 diesel VWs, they were sluggish but stupid reliable if you could keep the rust off. It was actually my first car with ""cruise control"" or my version of it: 4th gear, foot to the floor = 70 miles an hour. Downhill anyway."	2	0

They was actually doing well with their diesels for the last decade or so. The cars' good performance coupled with aggressive marketing meant that they actually made some good headway in overturning the damage GM did. Except, of course, that to do so they had to cut corners on emissions and cheat to pass government regulations. The damage done by the fallout on public perception of diesels in North America is as bad, if not worse, than what GM did all those years ago. 	1	0

Humans have been around a while, but have also been evolving since we have been here. Early humans, or rather humanoids, found that working together in small packs and using tools helped in survival rates. More humans were able to live and live easier because of tools and fire. Each human born then would learn from it's tribe how to use and make these tools, after a few generations in that tribe, it would be commonplace on how to make a throwing spear. 

As more and more people were able to survive and breed, more and more discovered better tools. Thier brains slowly, and I mean really slowly, got better with every generation. They would eventually discovering the early metals and be able to make even greater tools. This slow evolution of tools and knowledge continued for years  until we reached where we are today. Now with us becoming brighter and our quest for knowledge stronger than ever, when ever we have new questions about something we always try to apply logic. Look back at how ancient humans thought things used to work. The earth being flat is a good example, nearly everyone thought it, but when those who questioned it used logic to prove it wrong, they turned out right. Overtime we have stopped giving the unknown more mythical origins. We don't say that the earth is spun by an old man blowing on it, or the rain is the tear's of a flying dragon.  

But a thing to consider too is back then, you had plenty of generations to grow and get used to the regular spear, but when you look at us now with technology we are moving super fast. Look back even just 100 years ago to where we are now. It is quite amazing."	2	0

Same thing with singing. There is a clear technique to the breath, the air pressure, the lip movement, the tongue and soft palate, all of it.

Many great popular singers have classical training because it teaches you how to sing properly for your body. You'll notice that classical singers tend to have much longer careers/prime years than popular singers and Broadway stars. Often classical singers don't make it to the lead roles until they are 35 or so and they're still singing in their 60's. Operas are exhausting and difficult to sing and these people do it day after day for years!

If you want examples of popular singers with great technique, I'd suggest listening to Ella Fitzgerald and Adele.

The one I was trained with the most was standing upright then slowly rolling down til you can almost touch your toes. Focus on your breath and use your hands to feel where you're breathing the most. This helps you find your diaphragm and strengthens it. There are other things that help with strengthening and improving your voice as well. Posture is big, standing upright helps with diaphragm singing. There are also these things called resonators on the face, nasal cavities you can massage clockwise and counterclockwise to help sound resonate better. And mouth control is big too. Ever heard a singer and their voice sounded breathy for lack of a better word? If you don't have good mouth control you end up letting extra air escape and you're not using that air to propel the notes. 	1	0

All vocal production (singing or speaking) takes place thru development of strong abdominal muscles (sometimes referred to as ""using the diaphragm"") and learning to place the voice in the front of your head so it resonates.

They never seem to get hoarse. When we learn to speak through imitation and other aspects of language learning we 1) learn good AND bad habits which could lead to less singing time and 2) we stop needing to scream so those muscles (the voice is a bunch of muscles) aren't as well defined. It takes proper practice. You can do damage to your voice like you can damage your foot in soccer. 	1	0

Even the International Space Station, ~249 miles above the earth, is still slowed by atmospheric drag. The atmosphere is just thinner and thinner the farther out you go.

But maybe your idea could still work; you can just decrease your orbital altitude slowly while you reduce your speed, right? Well, the problem is, in order to have a stable orbit, you need to *increase* your speed the lower your altitude is. The International Space Station, ~249 miles above the earth, is orbiting at 4.76 miles per second. But a GPS Satellite, ~13,000 miles above the earth, is only going about half as fast: 2.37 miles per second.

So the more you slow down, the more unstable your orbit is, pulling you into a steeper re-entry. In order to maintain that orbit to be able to decelerate slowly, you would have to speed up instead, which is contrary to your goals."	5	0

The space shuttle is the most obvious example with its lifting body design, which reduced re-entry heat flux and acceleration to about 3 gs. Soyuz, although a capsule, generates a small amount of lift by having an offset center of mass, which reduces re-entry acceleration to about 4-5 gs instead of a pure ballistic reentry which could peak at 7-8 gs.

That means that the city you started in must be 24 hours ahead of itself, which is clearly nonsense. At some point as you move around the world, you need to skip back so that you'll be back at the same time as you started with when you get back to your original city.	16	0

So why do we say they are 14 hours apart instead of going the other way around and saying 10 hrs. 

(Now that you say it that way, it dawned on me)

The answer is that they ARE 10 hrs apart, but -10. 

UTC/GMT is 0. Every zone to the left is +
Everything to the left is -

The scale is from -12 to +12. 

We usually note zones in absolute value meaning number of zones.  

NY is GMT-4 daylight savings. 
Australia is +10. 

Mathematically, OP is making a mistake. 
Going east is subtraction. Going west is addition. 

-4 - (+10) = 14 hours

Going the other direction,

-4 + (+18) = 14 hours

The other way around is 18 zones from GMT, not 10. 

That's OP's mistake. 

Edit: Australia is not 10 hours ahead of NY, it's 18 hours ahead from NY and +10 hours from Greenwich. 

Going -10 the other way is ok, but then we'd be looking at yesterday's date and the earth spins in the other direction. "	4	0

If I say AUS is 14 ahead of NYC, that works correctly.  Time in NYC + 14 = time in AUS, and if it's past midnight then AUS is a day ahead.  This also works in reverse ""NYC is 14 behind AUS"".

If you want to say the other way (10 hours behind), you also have to say ""plus a day"", because you're measuring westward and crossing the date line westward adds a day.  Note that this does not work the other way unless you also change ""plus a day"" into ""minus a day"".  It also sounds a little weird ""10 hours behind plus a day"" because ""behind"" and ""plus"" have opposite ""sign"".  It seems like it could be simplified from ""-10H + 1D"" into ""+14H""."	3	0

Each request you send is sent wirelessly to your nearest cell tower. At that point the same data is sent via fiberoptic cables to the rest of the Internet. Your phone is no different than anything else on the Internet, it just uses a wireless connection for part of the route. It's not much different than how you use Wi-Fi at home.

Now let's talk about phone calls and text messages. These days they actually tend to be sent over the Internet too. However, they aren't necessarily - sometimes they're sent to the cell tower and then they're routed over the telephone network rather than the Internet.

Yes, it's technically possible and it has been done, but it doesn't work all that well. You could have a system where one phone talks to another directly, and they relay the conversation as needed between several of them. But there are downsides to that:

* It'd be extremely subject to interference. Now it's not only a local problem, it's also a problem for all that gets relayed through the point with interference
* Bandwidth would get much lower, and unpredictably so
* You can only have a conversation when there are enough phones around to relay it. Works in a city, but what about having a conversation when there's a desert or ocean in the middle?
* It's hard to do routing through millions of random, movable points without some kind of central authority anyway.

Without going too in detail on the physics, you can consider each object as something which both emits light (energy) and absorbs light (energy). Any object above 0 degrees K (-273 C) emits light energy to some degree.

The sun outputs energy in the visible range of light, the earth absorbs some of that energy. This causes the temperature of the earth to rise. Because the earth is above 0K (as we clearly know, it's about 20C or 293K), it emits energy in the form of infrared (IR) light.

We have an atmosphere, so just like the sun-earth model, the earth radiates energy to the atmosphere. The atmosphere is ""transparent"" to solar light, so we don't consider the sun warming the atmosphere.

The atmosphere absorbs some of the earth energy, is a higher T than 0K, and starts to radiate its own energy, also in the IR range. The thing here is, the atmosphere radiates both ""up"" (into space) and ""down"" (back to earth) - further warming the planet, which further warms the atmosphere, etc. This is the definition of the greenhouse effect. The earth and atmosphere eventually each equilibrium where temperatures are stable and energy in = energy out. We NEED the greenhouse effect to some natural degree - otherwise the earth would actually be too cold.

The problem with CO2 is that it *increases* the greenhouse effect, significantly, as CO2 is a potent absorber of IR radiation. The atmosphere absorbs more IR from the earth, which heats the atmosphere, which further heats the planet, etc. So our temperature equilibrium is shifting higher due to the increased CO2 in the atmosphere.

TL;DR - The greenhouse effect is essential to supporting life on earth, but increasing CO2 magnifies the effect and makes the planet too hot

edit: [here](http://www.realscience.org.uk/pics/greenhouse-effect.jpg) is a simple model of the GH effect [and here](http://www.drroyspencer.com/wp-content/uploads/greenhouse-gas-and-KT-diagram.jpg) is a more complicated model which takes into account more variables"	10	0

2.) The earth reflects some of this energy away.  Some of the energy is ""absorbed"" by the earth and the stuff on it, warming the earth and the stuff.

3.) Earth and stuff remain hotter than space, so eventually this warmth is ""re-emitted"" as a different kind of light (infrared light. We can't see it, but in this universe, everything shines).  

4.) This infrared light doesn't escape right away, because it bounces into other stuff, including air.  This warms that stuff and gets reemitted in a cycle. 

5.) Depending on the amount and type of stuff---and the amount of energy coming in from the sun---this keeps the earth at a certain general temperature, just like a lake might form between a big waterfall and a small river, with water always flowing in and out. 

6.) Carbon dioxide is especially good at absorbing heat, but it only absorbs heat at certain wavelengths.  So it doesn't block much of the light coming in from the sun, but it blocks a pretty big chunk of the heat that is being reemitted.  

Thus, more heat. Thus, (potentially) climate change.

Just want to expand on this a little bit.

The temperature that something is dictates the range of light it can emit.

The Earth is only hot enough to emit IR light, while the sun is hot enough to emit a lot of UV light.

If readers are still with us so far, what we're discussing here is Blackbody Radiation and Wein's Law (no longer ELI5).

A blackbody will emit a total energy flux (F) proportional to it's temperature (T) to the power 4.  F=(sigma)T^4 where sigma is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

A blackbody emits energy at **all** wavelengths of light, but at different intensities for each wavelength. Wein's law describes this by plotting intensity vs. wavelength, at a given temperature. [Graph](http://academic.greensboroday.org/~regesterj/potl/Waves/Light/wienslaw.jpg)

So the sun (roughly 6000K) has a peak output in the violet range of the visible spectrum, but also considerable output in the UV and IR, and is also outputting everywhere else on the EM spectrum at varying intensities.

Compare that curve to the curve for earth (300K curve, human) and you see that peak intensity is in the IR, and nearly negligible at other wavelengths."	2	0

Sleep debt as defined absolutely requires you to make up your lost sleep in some fashion, whereas sleep deprivation (what sleep debt causes) does not. 

David Gozal is Physician-in-chief at Herbert T. Abelson Professor of Pediatrics and a leading pioneer in sleep studies in children, said in a response to Sciencelife (a journal by the University of Chicago Medicine and Biological sciences) that we really don't know if recovering from longterm sleep deprivation is possible. He goes on to say that shortterm sleep deprivation (one or two nights) can easily be solved with one good rest--letting your body wake up naturally as opposed to setting any kind of alarm.

That's a huge differnce between saying multiple days of sleep deprivation can be solved by just one night of sleep. Every single person I've known who goes long period of sleep deprivation need more than 1 night to recover fully. Go to an event where people are up for multiple days(dance marathons will have hundreds of people) or people working through the night, if they go multiple days they need more than a night of good sleep.

Shortterm sleep deprivation as described in your ""dance marathon"" situation is easily recovered in one night. Just don't set an alarm and stay in bed 'til you wake up feeling refreshed.

Like a crack forms in an ice sheet, then water seeps down the crack and gets between that ice sheet and the land beneath. That water lubricates the bottom of the ice sheet and before you know it, a huge chunk has broken off and slid into the ocean. When ice no longer covers the ocean, heating is accelerated because the dark water absorbs more light than the white ice. The shape of air and heat currents (gulf stream?) can change, spelling huge differences in weather in certain places. 	2	0

That energy gets expressed in many places. More ice melts in summer, causing higher sea levels. More water evaporates, causing bigger storms. Those storms go further north (or south in the southern hemisphere) due to warmer oceans, causing damage in regions not prepared for them. The warmer atmosphere changes traditional weather patterns, meaning that areas will suddenly find themselves getting more or less precipitation than they're used to. Fertile areas will become deserts, populated areas will be flooded, areas with warm winters will see snow, some areas that were just hot will now be uninhabitably so, etc.

All that energy is enough to melt a lot more ice at the poles, as well. Even cursory monitoring of Polar ice or the rate of glacier retreat will show how much ice is melting, even now. It's astonishing. In a worst case scenario, that will result in sea levels rising massively, possibly by hundreds of feet over the next hundred years. Considering how many cities are built on the coast, it will result in millions, maybe billions of people being displaced. We're already seeing this in some Pacific islanders who are having to look for a new home.

So you have disrupted food supply and unpredictable and powerful storms, millions of refugees, and many of the largest cities that are centers of business and infrastructure are underwater.

Then you have environmental impacts. Before, when there were climatic shifts, animals would just alter their habitat, moving further north or south. But now most of the world has humans blocking their way with highways and residential developments, essentially locking many species in place as temperatures rise beyond what they can endure.

Less talked about is the threat to oceans. Carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere results in the oceans becoming more acidic. Combined with increased water temperatures, you see a lot of species suddenly unable to survive. If things go badly, the oceans could become too warm and acidic to support plankton, who are at the bottom of the ocean's food chain. Remove them, and all the fish who eat them starve, then all the fish who eat those fish starve, etc. We're already seeing places like the Great Barrier Reef die off. Coral reefs are the equivalent of the ocean's rainforests, containing a huge number of species.

There's also the risk of a runaway chain reaction. Rising temperatures will melt permafrost, ground that's been frozen for thousands of years. A lot of those permafrost deposits contain methane or other greenhouse gases, further accelerating the process. Plus, water vapor is a greenhouse gas as well. As more water on the surface of the sea is warm enough to evaporate, that translates into more heat being captured and making the earth warmer.

We get freaked out about the 2-3 degree mark because we suspect that might be where the point of no return is. If the temperature increases more than that, then it will go much higher even if we cease all CO2 emissions."	2	0

This is where I disagree with the common wisdom about the flaws of voting for a third party. Your vote isn't ""unheard"". If people vote for third parties in decent numbers you can be certain the two major parties take notice. 


It doesn't matter that the system is structured to make it next to impossible for those third parties to win, because what you can achieving by voting for them is to influence and change the direction/approach of the major parties.


A decent recent example of this is in the UK. In the last general election (2015) about 3.8m people voted for UKIP [~12% of pop], though they returned only 1 MP to parliament. It's regularly used as an example of how flawed our first-past-the-post (FPTP) system is, but looked at through a different lens - the large volume of UKIP voters [and the prediction of a large number of votes for that party prior to the election] had a *significant* influence on Conservative party policy and was a large part of the reason why they made a manifesto pledge to have an in/out referendum on the EU. And we all know what happened after that. 


UKIP were unlikely to ever go on and become a major power in politics, but through large numbers of people voting for essentially a party 'doomed' to fail their voice was heard and their influence on the bigger party was had.  


What is often overlooked in the clamour for alternative voting systems is that FPTP has its benefits too. It creates stability - rather than elections resulting in inexperienced parties being swept into power or broad coalition governments controlled by no single party it offers continuity and stability in terms of the parties of power. Alongside this 'single-issue' parties rise and fall in prominence as short and medium term issues come to the fore politically, influence the major parties and then find they recede into the background.


Finally just to say - I'm not suggesting that FPTP is the *best* system available, just trying to offer a bit of counter balance to the well documented limits/issues of FPTP."	2	0

It may seem like that if you look over a narrow amount of time, but they have both drifted around, they change their policies, their beliefs to reflect the voters.  Essentially the two parties represent abstracts in terms of politics, the left and the right.  As the population changes their overall beliefs, say same-sex marriage becomes more acceptable than it was 10 years before, then its dropped as an issue to oppose it.  Even though the republicans were the party against same sex marriage, the position of the republican party shifts further left on that issue to keep the center roughly situated between them and the democratic social position on LGBT which still alienates some more central people.  And the same works for issues on the democrat side. 

The two parties keep the center between them, and shifts in voting force the parties to adapt to stay relevant, they have a balance between them that if one starts gaining ground the other adapts to take ground.  There is never space for a third party because the the great majority of the US voting public is claimed by the two parties.  

A third party gaining real ground would actually force the mainstream to move in the opposite direction. Libertarians gaining ground would force the republicans more centrist and greens gaining ground would force the democrats more centrist as well, because they'd need to take votes from other major party to compensate for the ones lost to the third party.   So let's say the libertarians start getting a steady 20% of the voting public, then the republicans who were at roughly 50% have been cut down to approximately 30% and have to push left to take 10% off the democrats to get a 40/40/20 split.  Its less work than pushing to the right into the libertarians.  The shifting center will alienate the third party and make their views less mainstream.  This will result in the left-most of the libertarians going back to the republicans and the democrats moving to compensate for the republican gains of a few percent.  Both parties are pushing to the center and leaving only spaces on the fringe.  And this happens for a 100 years, and we have two very similar parties around the political center.  

The center of the bell curve is divided up by the two major parties, and fringe parties can only get little bits of the tail, if they ever manage to get more, the major parties react to adapt to the new political reality. "	7	0

Hence, we end up in a system where each of the major parties is trying to keep their support base broad enough to get to around 50% of the vote. As a result, there really isn't any room for additional major parties; if your voting group was significant enough, it would already have been made into the platform of one of the two big parties.

As a result, voting for your own third party functionally hurts you; every vote for a third party is a vote taken away from the major party that holds a similar opinion, rather than from the major party on the opposite side, hence the major party more similar to you is less likely to hit the 50%+1 vote target needed to win the election overall.

Even if the third party does better than the major party it is most similar to, that major party will likely collapse, and the third party will be the new major party in it's place. Under our current voting system, there will always be two major parties, no more, no less."	3	0

Members of the party can run for other local offices and have a reasonable chance to win, because people know the mayor and so believe that other politicians in that party share those values.

If you design a pension and medical scheme based on the assumption that population would grow consistently (as was the case after WW2 when most modern welfare systems were either established or finalized) and you base it on *direct transfers* from the payers to the beneficiaries then it works very much like a pyramid scheme. You need the original growth in population to continue over decades to service the ever growing beneficiary population and then if you want to promise (as a politician) a further improvement...

Current welfare is an economic insanity (actually a very long-term con) which reverses the natural, logical cycle of ""make, save, consume"" and assumes present consumption and future production. The production falls to future generation whose welfare is in turn provided by the subsequent future generation...

The sooner we end with the illusion that anything is ""guaranteed"" or (as is the case with public debt) ""irrelevant"" and start figuring ways of ending the insanity and focusing on solving the problem with logical solutions rather than scams the better.

The rock that's above the plate boundary can be one solid piece that gets pulled more by one side than the other, so the fault doesn't develop directly above the plate boundary.

Firstly, a fault does not cause an earthquake; a fault is a *result* of an earthquake. When rock ruptures, it produces a fault. The vibrations of that rupture are what we detect as earthquakes. Once a fault ahs formed it can reactivate, but a fault forms specifically because it is located in an area which has in the past been subject to extreme stresses which resulted in fracturing rock.

Secondly, plate boundaries are not the neat single-line features that school-level tectonic maps would have you believe. Boundaries are made up of countless inter-related faults at a huge variety of scales; from 1000 km long features right down to countless mm-scale features. 

To understand why they are broad zones of activity you must first understand that because the earth is a sphere the strain rates at different points on a fault or plate boundary can be significantly different. Peel an orange into one or two big pieces. Put them back together and try to move one bit of peel against another. As you should see - the directions and magnitudes of movement of one plate relative to another vary along the length of the contact. There is no such thing as a straight line on a sphere.

All of this comes together to mean that when the plates move they get localised peaks in stress. Where these peaks in stress intersect with weaknesses in rockthen faults will generally form. The different parts of the fault move, and the stress is transferred further along the system. That can either trigger events further along the same fault plane (as happened with the 2004 boxing day earthquake, with unzipping along a 1000 km long section of subduction zone), or it can apply stresses off-axis which trigger seimicity in adjoining faults. Imagine something like this: http://sanuja.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/fault_structure_flower.jpg

People have talked about earth movement being a deeper feature rather than at the surface - this isn't really true. The upper crust is the coldest and most brittle part, and therefore where faulting tends to occur. The upper 15 km of crust has by far the majority of faults. Below this depth more ductile behaviour becomes increasingly common, so you get [folds](http://www.strachur.org.uk/assets/images/geology/folding.jpg) rather than fractures.

Finally, it is misleading to imagine faults as being purely transform or purely normal or purely reverse; most earthquakes lie on a spectrum between these endmembers, and the behaviour of individual faults can change through time. Movement on fault planes is usually oblique, accommodating both horizontal and vertical motion."	2	0

So let's denote the elements of the sequence by a(n) (eg. a(1) is the first, a(2) the second and so on). The sequence is defined as follows:

* a(1) = k
* a(2) = cos(a(1))
* a(3) = cos(a(2))
* and so on, with the general case being a(n+1) = cos(a(n)).

Here it's important to know that m is the only number which is its own cosine. To see that there are no more than one such number, you can show that the function x - cos(x) is increasing by looking at its derivative, and hence it can't have multiple zeroes. If you want to see that there's at least one such m, you use the intermediary value theorem on x - cos(x) (it's continuous, negative at 0, and positive at 1, so it has to be zero somewhere between).

Now, if we knew that the sequence has a limit A, it would be easy to show it to be m. You just take the limit where n goes to infinity on both sides in the formula a(n+1) = cos(a(n)). Since cos is continuous, you can take the limit inside (this is even one common definition of continuity). This gives A = cos(A), so A is m. 

However, we don't know that the sequence converges at all, so we need slightly more complex stuff. First, since k is a real number, cos(k) is on the interval [-1,1]. From this one sees that cos(cos(k)) is on the interval [cos(1), 1]. 

Now [cos(1), 1] is a much better interval to start from, since the (EDIT: absolute value of the) derivative of cos on it is at most sin(1), which is less than 1. If one knew advanced math, one would just refer to eg. the [Banach fixed point theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_fixed-point_theorem) to see that there is a limit, which is a fixed point of cos. However, since that isn't exactly common knowledge, I'll go through a more detailed proof.

The trick is to show that the distance |x-m| shrinks by a factor of sin(1) if we replace x and m by their cosines (note that m doesn't change as we take the cosine). One way to do this is to note that cos is the integral function of -sin. Hence cos(x)-cos(m) is just the integral of -sin(t) from x to m. Since x and m are in [cos(1), 1], the integrand -sin(t) always has an absolute value of at most sin(1). Hence, the absolute value |cos(x)-cos(m)| cannot exceed sin(1) times the length of the integration interval, which is |x-m|. Another way to get the same conclusion is the [mean value theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_value_theorem).

Anyways, we have that |cos(x)-cos(m)| is at most sin(1)|x-m|. The difference |cos(x)-cos(m)| is |cos(x)-m|, since cos keeps m in place. By repeating, we get that |cos(cos(...(cos(x))...)) - m| is at most sin(1)^(n)|x-m|, where we had taken n cosines. Since sin(1)^(n) converges to zero, the iterates get closer and closer to m. Thus, we get that on our interval of [cos(1), 1], iterating cosines always takes you to m.

I dont get it at all. The cliche sort of answer would be picasso, without a doubt.

Van gogh was impressionist, but not by a long shot the person to create or popularize impressionism. The standard person to be called responsible for that is Monet.

 Frankly, there is not any van gogh painting that I would consider to be pushing any boundaries or creating new artistic ideas...It was mainly typical post impressionist portraits and flowers. There were plenty of contemporary painters doing work which looked very much like his.

 He never became popular during his lifetime and its a bit mysterious to me how he became so popular after his death. Frankly I would expect that people who like van gogh would still prefer edvard munch...the two seem rather similar to me except that Munch is more intriguing.

The most remarkable thing about van gogh was probably limited to his personal life...not his artwork. He was a sad human struggling with mental illness. The fact that he cut off his own ear is probably a huge reason why people remember him at all. He is probably a great deal like lord byron...an artist who is remembered not so much for his work, but rather his unusual character."	-1	0

When you look at a Renoir, Monet, Manet, Pissaro, etc. you see an essentially ""realistic"" scene, but one which has been created through unusual techniques (such as pointillism). 
  
Van Gogh takes this a step farther.  Quite often (but not always) his paintings do not really show something that would be described as ""realistic"".  He instead depicts the concept of a thing, rather than rendering a literal image of the thing.  You can squint at most impressionist paintings and imagine that you are looking at a realistic painting; not true with many Van Gogh's. 
   
I think that in some ways you could describe him as the bridge from impressionism to true abstract art.  
   
His technique was also unusual (although not unique).  He had a habit of applying large globs of paint to the canvas, giving his paintings a texture that isn't totally apparent in photographs. "	3	0

In both cases, well designed studies will compare two groups of people in an attempt to isolate one particular risk factor and see how it relates certain outcomes (e.g. disease).  For example, a cohort study linking smoking tobacco with lung cancer might take two groups (cohorts) of people, one that smokes, and one that doesn't, that are otherwise similar and follow up with them for the next 20 years and see how many develop cancers.  Once you have your data you can calculate what's called a 'relative risk.'  

And what if there's some other variable increasing the one cohort's risk over the other that's not smoking?  This is known as confounding.  We have a couple tools to prevent this:

* Random selection:  individuals are randomly chosen to participate in the study.  This reduces the chances of biased selection (e.g. picking a bunch of people with family history of lung cancer who are smokers to be in your smoker cohort)

* Matched controls:  Ideally you match your smokers with your nonsmokers to try and eliminate noise from other variables.  For every female smoker in the study, you have a female nonsmoker, and so on.
* Inclusion/exclusion criteria:  Studies will set criteria for who can participate to eliminate confounding.  For example, you might exclude anyone with a history of cancer from the study because they're already much more likely to develop cancer

* Large sample size: this is probably the biggest one.  Bigger sample sizes give you more statistical power and a greater ability to say with certainty whether there is a difference between groups based on the risk factor.  Bigger sample size also tends to dilute out confounding factors so you can really focus on what you're testing


All that said, there's plenty of published literature out there based on shaky methods and statistics, so if you're skeptical, pay close attention to experimental methods.

They take two (or more) cohorts (groups) of people who are similar in important factors--age, sex, race, diseases/conditions that they may already have (often people who already have particular diseases/conditions are often excluded from the study), who differ in one particular factor called the ""risk factor."" This doesn't mean that everyone in each cohort is exactly the same (such as 50 year old Hispanic men), but that the average age between the two groups is the same, the two groups have the same distribution of men/women and particular races, etc. They then follow these people over time to see how the rate of a particular outcome (such as death) differs between these two groups. 

An example for illustration: Perhaps we want to study how smoking affects the rate of death. The outcome we are studying, then, is death. The risk factor we are investigating is smoking status. We would then seek out two groups of people, those who smoke and those who don't smoke. We would want to make sure our two groups differ as little as possible except for if they do or do not smoke, so we will check to make sure the average age and distribution in each group is similar (we don't want one group with a bunch of 20 year olds and a bunch of 80 year olds, and the other group with a bunch of 50 year olds, even if the average age is similar). We want the amount of men and women in each group to be similar, same with the percentage of each race in each group. We probably want to exclude anyone that has any existing disease/condition that might already increase their rate of death. We also probably want to define what ""non-smoker"" and ""smoker"" means as well in terms of pack-years (a measure of how much a person smokes over a long period of time). We would then track these two groups of people over a period of time, let's say 20 years. After 20 years we would compare the rate of death between the two groups. This is vastly oversimplified, but that is the gist.

Ideally, we would have clones in each group, but that is impossible with humans. It also could possibly make the results less applicable to the general population. For example, how applicable are study results that only looked at 45 year old healthy white men for a 60 year old black woman with heart disease? Probably not that applicable, depending on the study/outcome. Study designs attempt to control for major characteristic differences, but for practicality purposes, minor differences are either a) assumed to be inconsequential to the study outcome; b) assumed to be insignificant due to their relative infrequency within the large study group; or c) found to be significant after the data is collected and is suggested as a future area of research.

So lets say in the non-smoking group 80 people out of 1000 died after 20 years: 80/1000= 0.08 = 8%, so 8% of the non-smoking group died. Lets say in our smoking group, 200 people out of 1000 died: 200/1000 = 0.2 = 20%. That is our base data.

Some calculations we can do to compare the two:
Relative risk: this is how likely an outcome is to occur in one group as compared to another group. For us, we would compare the relative risk of dying in smokers compared to non-smokers. This is calculated by dividing the rate of death in smokers by the rate of death in non-smokers: 0.2/0.08= 2.5. What this means is that in our study, smokers were 2.5x more likely to die than non-smokers. 

Relative risk is good for comparing the two groups, but it only tells us how much more likely something is to happen in comparison of one group to another, it doesn't tell us what the actual risk is. What if the rate of death in smokers was 2% and the rate in non-smokers was 1%? The relative risk would be 2 (death is 2x more likey to happen in smokers as compared to non-smokers), but the risk of dying in either group is still really small (2% or 1%). This is where absolute risk increase comes in (or absolute risk reduction, if we are comparing something like a cancer treatment vs no treatment in reducing the rate of death). We already know what are absolute risks are: there is a 8% risk of dying in non-smokers and a 20% risk of dying in smokers. We then subtract the rates of death in each group: 20%-8%= 12%. This means that smoking increases your risk of death by 12% as compared to those who don't smoke. In other words, in a group of 100 people who smoke, 12 fewer people (12/100) would die if they didn't smoke. This better illustrates the magnitude of the risk than relative risk. If the rate of death in smokers is 2% and the rate of death in non-smokers is 1%, then the absolute risk increase is only 1%, or in other words, in a group of 100 people who smoke, only 1 fewer person would die if they didn't smoke. This magnitude of risk is much smaller than the numbers found in our (fake) study.There are other epidemiological calculations that can be done like odds ratios, etc too. 

For your specific example, you say the average age of death is 81. This is the average out of all people in Canada. A reduced rate of death would be something like, lets say we look at the average age of death in people in Canada who exercise at least 3 times per week, and their average age of death is 86. The average age of death of people in Canada who don't exercise at least 3x per week is 79. You could say that people in Canada who exercise at least 3x per week have a reduced rate of death compared to those who don't exercise 3x per week, as they are living 7 years longer (assuming everything else is the same between the two groups of people or is inconsequentally different, which in this case we can't say for sure because we haven't looked at distribution of age, sex, race, socioeconomic status, other health conditions, etc. This would be a terrible study design that would be rejected.)

It's a shitty tactic meant to penalize you for paying down your loan and avoiding interest.

That's a profit of $93,256 for you!

But good news! Two years into their loan they win the lottery and decide to pay off the whole thing! Unfortunately, the interest has only accumulated for 2 years, so they'll only have paid you a total of $110,000.  That means only $10,000 in profit for you instead of $93,256, which sucks for you!

Finding people qualified to lend cash to used to be very difficult, so when they did find someone they were really banking on $93k profit instead of just $10k.  Someone paying their loan off early would be a significant loss to the bank.  That's why they used to put in the pre-pay penalties, to recoup some of their losses from expected revenue.  

Then banking laws and lending standards changed so it is MUCH easier to find people to lend cash to. Now banks are of the mindset that they need capital more than expected gains, as they can always find someone to lend that $100k to as soon as they have it back.

If you let a chiropractor crack your neck or your back, he/she may injure or paralyze you, by damaging the relatively important structures in that area, such as the spine. So that's how it works.

Other than that it isn't any more effective than a therapeutic massage, and potentially much more dangerous since there is not a sound set of standards and practices for what works and what causes potentially severe harm. "	5	0

Done properly, that is.

When driving is becoming ""second nature"" to you, it's partly because you learn to drive better from experience. The traffic tends to behave more or less consistently, so you learn to anticipate what happens next.
Another, more troubling part of this is that you start to be less prudent than before, as you gain your confidence.

- You rent out the house for $1000/mo., which covers the $750/mo.

- You'll also have other expenses, for things like repairs/replacement of stuff in the house. You'll also want to have a reserve of cash for the times when a tenant moves out and you haven't yet rented the place out again. So say you're break even at the $1000 a month.

- but over time you can start raising the rent, so you can start pulling some of that out as income.

- also, you are building equity in the house, both by making the mortgage payments and any appreciation in value.

- so 5 years later, maybe the house is worth $120k and you've grown your equity from the initial $20k to a total of $50k from the mortgage payments, plus the additional $20k in value means you sell and walk away with $70k from your initial $20k investment, and that $50k gain came all from the tenants' rent payments."	5	0

These are essentially a fancy IOU the government has issued that say, ""If you gives us $X now, in Y years, we'll give you $X+interest."" 

These have been sold for a long time, and the money is only due from the government when that amount of time has passed. Once the term of the IOU has run out, the government pays you, and a tiny portion of the US federal debt has been replaced.

All US government debt is held and dealt with in US dollars. If you're a foreign citizen, it's on you to then exchange those dollars for your local currency, or whatever you want. Since we pay our debt in US dollars, and also control the printing of US dollars, the US *could* theoretically, just start running the printing presses and give everyone what they're owed. After all, they're owed a certain amount of dollars, not a certain value those dollars represent. 

However, the problem with this is inflation. Contrary to not involving our economic system, this would severely undermine it. Printing money would raise the inflation rate, making individual US dollars less valuable, and while a little inflation can be good, too much is a bad thing. Furthermore, it'd undermine trust in the US government. Would you loan money to someone who then turns around and games the system to repay you with worthless junk? No, and that'd mean that debt for the US government would become more expensive, and that's bad. 

It's the same problem with just printing enough money to give a million dollars to anyone. When you do that, you make it so a million dollars just isn't worth as much. Does it matter if you're a millionaire when a Big Mac costs a thousand bucks?  "	5	0

The number of households that fall within that range has fallen, as more incomes have skewed either toward the bottom or top -- good paying blue collar jobs in factories, etc have been replaced with low paying service jobs, while at the opposite end there are more dual income professional households, more high paying jobs in tech, professional services (consulting, accounting, law, advertising/marketing), finance if one has the right degrees and training.	3	0

&gt;Many social scientists including economist Michael Zweig and sociologist Dennis Gilbert contend that middle class persons usually have above median incomes. As social classes lack clear boundaries and overlap there are no definite income thresholds as for what is considered middle class. In 2004, sociologist Leonard Beeghley identifies a male making $57,000 and a female making $40,000 with a combined households income of $97,000 as a typical middle-class family.[26] In 2005, sociologists William Thompson and Joseph Hickey estimate an income range of roughly $35,000 to $75,000 for the lower middle class and $100,000 or more for the upper middle class.

It is considered shrinking because The Survey of Affluence and Wealth in America, I believe in 2008, stated that 50% of all retail sales were made by the affluent, thus the economy no longer is driven by the middle class as it had been for decades if not longer. This was confirmed when a Citibank memo called the current economy a plutonomy, where according to Investopedia ""economic growth that is powered and consumed by the wealthiest upper class of society.""

Then when you consider the slow growth of wages by the middle class and the rate of inflation prior to the 2008 financial crisis, the middle class has had to do more with less and for the pass eight years has been dealt a blow due to the 2008 financial crisis in forecloses, low wages and staggering debt. Thus the point of becoming considered poor keep rising while incomes remain the same."	1	0

When you hear Bernie Sanders cite numbers about how ""the middle class is shrinking"" he's going to use a definition of middle class that makes his number more impressive. That doesn't mean he's wrong, but someone who wanted to argue that the middle class is fine would use a different definition. 

What is true that more people think they're middle class than actually are by any reasonable definition. Public opinion surveys find that everyone from people making just over the poverty line to people in the top 2% of income earners thinks they're in the middle class. "	1	0

The oddmakers have access to stats that most bettors don't. Some professional level bettors do have similar info. 

The main point of creating a spread is to get even action on both sides. The casinos take 10% of the bets. So they don't care about being accurate. The care about making money. 

Let's go over and example. Let's say the Patriots are playing the Lions and the casino favors the Pats by 7. Let's say the public jumps on the Pats and 80% of the money ends up on them. The casino doesn't like this because if the Pats win by 10, they will lose money.  They want it to be a 50/50 split to make sure they profit. 

The Patriots are a popular team, so even if their stats say one thing, the oddsmakers might change the spread so that the public doesn't overwhelm one side of the bet. During their perfect season the Patriot lines got out of hand and if you just bet against them, you'd do pretty well. "	2	0

&gt;A 2010 review of scientific evidence on manual therapies for a range of conditions concluded that spinal manipulation/mobilization may be helpful for several conditions in addition to back pain, including migraine and cervicogenic (neck-related) headaches, neck pain, upper- and lower-extremity joint conditions, and whiplash-associated disorders. The review also identified a number of conditions for which spinal manipulation/mobilization appears not to be helpful (including asthma, hypertension, and menstrual pain) or the evidence is inconclusive (e.g., fibromyalgia, mid-back pain, premenstrual syndrome, sciatica, and temporomandibular joint disorders).

&gt;[Chiropractic] is almost always more dangerous than beneficial.

This is baseless. If you have any evidence to support this, I'd like to see it."	2	0

Some accrediting organizations are better than others. For example, when you're talking about accrediting a college like, say, Harvard or most local community colleges near you, there are *regional* accrediting organizations that accredit the school and each program within it. These regional accrediting organizations are of long standing and have high standards and are well-respected. Then, there are *federal* accrediting organizations. These have much lower standards. They are the organizations that accredit schools like for-profit colleges such as DeVry or the Art Institutes. The accreditation doesn't mean a lot in terms of quality, which is why it's not a great idea to go to a school that has a federal accreditation but not a regional accreditation. Federal accreditation might mean only that yes, this is a school, and they have classes that teach stuff in a coherent, organized way, and therefore if the students want a student loan, they can be eligible to get one to go to this school.  It's not a commentary on the validity of the idea expressed in the classroom. It's just a check mark that it teaches what it says it will teach, that it has a coherent curriculum, and that there are jobs students can get when they graduate.	1	0

Helium leaks out between the rubber molecules of the skin of the balloon. It leaks out pretty slowly, obviously! Mylar's molecules are closer together, so it doesn't leak out there.

The balloon stays the same size? I've watched this happen ever since I was a kid, and that's not true. They all always get smaller.

Let's think about your claim: ""its size not changing."" You discuss the state of the balloon some few days after it gladly would hit the ceiling. But how about three years later? Or even three weeks later? If it's smaller at these times, then either a)it must have always been getting smaller, or b)some condition of how the helium was escaping must have changed. Since it's pretty unreasonable to think that helium would not work the same over time with respect to leaking out of a balloon, then it must have always been changing size, and your observation was not careful enough to notice it or to record it.

Normal Internet traffic is unicast meaning that a packet is delivered to a single recipient. Multicast on the other hand allows a single packet to be delivered to any member of that multicast group. This is a bit more complex as the members will have to talk to all the switches and routers between them and the sender to get them to forward a copy of the packet. However it uses a lot less bandwidth as it does not have to send the same data in individual packet to each consumer but can let the routers close to the receiver split the packet to each of the receivers. The most common use case is live television where you might have a lot of viewers in the same neighborhood watching the same video stream. However it have not seen a lot of use because of its complexity. It is doing a comeback now as live video over the Internet is becoming more and more popular. However there are still only a few continuous multicast enabled networks on the Internet.

So in short it is a cool technology but likely not something that would affect your gameing performance as no games implement this as it is quite unlikely to have multicast enabled in the networks between you and the host."	2	0

One of the easiest ways to see this - looking fabulous in your home mirror, then getting startled seeing yourself in a shop window or fitting room mirror because you don't look at all the same in this new context.

This is why most car accidents occur in areas familiar to the driver, especially their own streets - driving the same location over and over, the brain puts in a memory of the street to save on processing energy. Then when they suddenly hit something, ""it just came outta nowhere!"" because as far as they're aware.... it did.

This effect is applied to everything, including the people we spend the most time with (and our own reflections).

I'm not sure what you have in mind, but it isn't true. Relative motion doesn't require an absolute origin or absolute standard of rest, and neither does the expansion of the universe.

There's no way to formalize a difference between relative motion and expansion of space. You can't define a tensor field that quantifies the extent to which space is expanding.

&gt;Measure motion relative to the CMB.

If you make a shielded lab in freefall, and in it have a couple of relatively-moving light detectors with appropriate velocities, and light with CMB-like symmetry, the detectors will both find the light to be isotropic.

It's easiest to see how this works in the case where everything has negligible mass and so the spacetime in the lab is Minkowskian. In that case, the detectors move inertially away from a common origin event, and the light has Lorentz symmetry with respect to the same origin.

Is it superluminal? While that is mathematically possible (coordinates are always arbitrary anyway), I think that is very ugly. If you try to estimate the redshift with these velocities and the relativistic Doppler formula, you get a lot of nonsense.	1	0

Your lower digestive tract is highly specialized to get that shit on outta there, and it does so with great efficiency. 

Small muscles along the colon spasm to push poop down to the rectum, which has walls that stretch to accommodate it, and then on to the anal canal. The anal canal has *two* sphincters, and the inner anal sphincter is not under conscious control. It stays contracted to prevent leakage. The external anal sphincter surrounds that.

So all of this is specifically fine tuned to push out poop, which is normally fairly soft. When you shove a lightbulb or something up there, your body isn't equipped to handle that. Things stretch in ways they're not meant to, which creates trauma, and muscles designed to move stool aren't strong enough to propel a yankee candle. Also, your stool isn't solid enough to push something heavy out ahead of it.

It's kinda like putting diesel in a gas engine. It's just not what it's designed for."	6	0

Also, physical evidence deteriorates and being able to refute evidence using forensic tests becomes less realistic or accurate.

But basically the idea that the person is reformed means nothing (or very very little) when considering the fact that they still violated a person's rights. The victim still deserves justice in their case. The government cares very little, if at all, about individual people because it's main job is to create and enforce laws and protect people rights. To that end, they institute a statute of limitations to ensure that the accused rights are not violated by denying them an adequate defense. There is some cost/benefit consideration as well like the example about petty theft, but even rape/child molestation etc have limitations because as time goes by it's harder and harder to argue against charges or to prove the state's case for that matter 	4	0

Unless he have specially designed breathing equipment in which case he will be fine. It is not the pressure that kills you but the problems of supplying you with oxygen. And at high pressures air changes properties so there is a long list of issues with getting oxygen to deep sea divers. But pressure is not the direct issue. If you look at deep diving whales for example they just stops breathing when they dive. They even exhale before they dive and survive on what oxygen is dissolved in their blood.

So pressure is not an issue for animals. However low pressure can be an issue. Again even the vacuum of space will not kill you before you suffocate. So if you were to put a deep sea whale in a vacuum chamber he could probably survive for a few hours. But the problem is the rapid loss of pressure. When you put a gas and a liquid together the gas will dissolve into the liquid. And the higher the pressure the more gas will dissolve. And when you lower the pressure the gas will release from the liquid. You see this all the time with soda. This also happens in your lungs where nitrogen dissolves into your blood. And in fish the gas molecules in the water will dissolve into the blood though the gills. Fish also have a swim bladder which is filled with gas that they can regulate to help them swim.

You can radiate waste heat into space.  The space suits contain chilled water circulation systems to maintain the astronauts body temperature and comfort.   CO2 is absorbed by cycling the air through CO2 scrubber canisters and a little bit of oxygen is added back to the mix.  Urine is collected and disposed of after the EVA.  Only thing that might be an issue is if you suddenly have to take a dump, but astronaut meal times and meal contents are closely controlled as to avoid unexpected bowel movements.  Almost all EVAs are scheduled well ahead of time, so you have time to adjust your diet accordingly.

As for how they remove the heat, well in a vacuum water sublimates (freezes and then turns to gas), this process sucks up heat, just like boiling a pot of water takes a flame on your stove to make it happen, a warm plate with sublimate water on it and result in a cold plate. In the space suit they have a plate with holes in it, and water flows through the holes, hits the hard vacuum clogging the hole, then sublimates, and the hole frees up allowing more water out, keeping the plate very cold no matter how much heat you put into it (water just sublimates faster, it doesn't get hotter). The steam is just vented to space. These cold plates are used to chill water that is pumped through the space suit.

This was the way it was first done in Linux - back when you had to compile your own kernel if you wanted support for sound (for example).

As kernels got more sophisticated, they became too large to go with the ""one size fits all"" things, so they evolved to use modules, that could be added in whenever needed, and to accomodate more complex and sophisticated hardware.

Nowadays, I don't know what Windows uses, but as for MacOS, I'm pretty sure they use a monolithic kernel, since the hardware is pretty narrowly defined.

Linux used modules, but I'm not sure about Android or iOS.

The alternative to a monolith is to break the large program up into several smaller programs, each of which has a more narrow list of responsibilities. The alternative to a monolith is called (especially if you like buzzwords) something like ""Service Oriented Architecture"" or ""Microservices"".

Monolith: One big program which performs a number of tasks 

Microservices: Many little programs, each of which only does one thing

Operating systems are just programs, although they have a very specific set of responsibilities and are treated specially by the system. Some of these responsibilities  are things like memory management, process management, thread management, disk management, device drivers, event handling and routing, I/O processing, interrupt processing, security and access, etc. Despite the fact that something like ""Process management"" is a pretty different beast from ""I/O processing"", these two things are still compiled into a single Kernel binary. In a monolith, if you need to update one of these, you have to update the whole shebang. This is a monolith.

The alternative to a monolith would be to break all the different responsibilities into their own binaries, and those would communicate over some kind of messaging channel. This is called a ""Microkernel"" approach. Microkernel seems nice because each individual service can be smaller, simpler, and able to be managed/updated independently. The problem comes because the messaging channel which allows these services to communicate starts to become very complicated: handling enough bandwidth, keeping messages properly ordered, serializing and deserializing, keeping message contract versions in sync between services, etc. And then there are all the complexities where you have to keep track of which order the services are initialized in during boot-up, and all the million possible scenarios of what the system should do if one of the services crashes while the other ones are still healthy, etc.

Linux, BSD and Android are pure monoliths. 

Windows basically uses ""hybrid"" approach with three basic parts: HAL, ""the microkernel"" and ""the executive"", where ""the microkernel"" is basically a normal monolithic kernel, and ""the executive"" contains several services which operate in kernel mode.

Darwin (iOS, OSX) also uses a hybrid approach, though it's harder to describe. There's a kernel called ""Mach"", but there are components borrowed from FreeBSD like I/O and POSIX, and there are also a number of microkernel-like services though many of them run in user-space to avoid context-switches.

The only ""real"" microkernel system I can think of for modern OS's is GNU Hurd, which has been under development for nearly 30 years and STILL isn't ready for reliable wide-spread use because of the inherent complexities of the approach. Symbian was a microkernel, but a lot of complexity there disappeared because symbian ran on single-core phones, and Symbian isn't really a thing anymore with the advent of iOS and Android."	5	0

The reason why it explodes however, is because the frame of the press actually is bent bent by the massive force of a hydraulic press and when the object can't take as much force so suddenly it will spring back incredibly fast.

Like plants, fungi have a cell wall but it is composed of chitin, a polymer of n-acetyl glucosamine, rather than cellulose, a polymer of glucose. Fungi, like animals, are heterotrophs. Fungi secret enzymes to externally digest food then these nutrients are absorbed.  Animals ingest (eat) food followed by internal digestion and absorption of nutrients. Some fungi have stages in their life cycle that are motile in liquid (water molds) and, in the past, they were considered ""animal-like"". That classification is many, many years outdated.

There are more, and it's complicated and messy. Scientists have done their best to try and classify life as neatly as possible, but evolution is not an organized process.

At the highest level (and this is still in debate by scientists) there are possibly 3 categories of life on Earth: bacteria, archaea, and eukaryota.

1. Bacteria are pretty much exactly what you'd expect, single cell organisms that lack a nice or individual organelles (the inside of a bacteria is like a bag of trail mix with everything jumbled together whereas eukaryotes have individually packaged parts like a travel bag of peanuts and travel bag of pretzels).

2. Archaea were for a long time classified along with bacteria because they are also single celled and lacked those organelles, but recent study of their RNA has revealed they are perhaps more like you and me than bacteria.

3. Eukaryota are a very recognizably diverse group that includes everything from single cell protists, to plants, works, zebras, and humans.

Within each of these groups they are further divided into sub-groups just like how music can be split into genres like rock and jazz, and then rock can be further split into punk rock, soft rock, etc."	3	0

Also as far as we know archaeas do not cause diseases (those are bacterias).

You have 3 domains: (eu)bacteria, archaea (archebacteria), eukarya. The difference between them  is in cell structure and evolutional positon.

English is a foreign language for me, but since this is the top post I'll try to use it to explain again and summarize the main points:


&gt;fungi are composed of eukaryotic cells

It means they have a nucleus that is well defined; it's not scattered around the cell, like in bacteria. Bacteria are prokaryotic (the opposite of eukaryotic), while fungi, plants and animals are all eukaryotic (no exceptions).

&gt;Fungal cells differ from plant cells in that they do not have chloroplasts and cannot carry out photosynthesis

Chloroplasts are cell structures necessary to do photosynthesis. Plants and some bacteria can do photosynthesis. Fungi and animal can't do it (no exceptions).

&gt;fungi have a cell wall

Not every living being has a cell wall: only plants, bacteria, and well, fungi. It's kind of obvious but it's exactly like a wall, it exists to protect the cells. Animals do not have cell walls, we only have a membrane.

&gt;Fungi, like animals, are heterotrophs.

Heterotroph means a being that has to look for food, while autotrophs are beings that can produce their own food. Plants can do photosynthesis and thus create their own food. Animals and fungi, though, have to look for external sources of food. Be it a lion looking for some deer to eat, or a sponge waiting for a nutrient to filter, we all need something else to give us food/energy.

&gt; Some fungi have stages in their life cycle that are motile in liquid

One of the criteria for being an animal is to have at least of stage in its life that the being is motile (*mobile? not sure if spelling*). Even sponges, for example, can move when they are born. In the past this criteria, according to the poster, made it confusing to say if fungi were animals or not.

In sum, some of the basic points to classify in what kingdom some living being is, we have some classifications:

* Is it prokaryotic or eukaryotic?
* Is it made of only one cell or multiple cells?
* Is it autotroph or heterotroph?
* Can it move by itself in at least one stage of its life?

As we can see, fungi are like a middle term for some of these criteria, hence the difficult are saying if they are plants or animals. We now know they are unique and deserve to have their own kingdom, their own group.

They happened to use base-10, and because indian-arabic number system was so much better than anything else that had come before, everyone just switched from whichever base they were using to those. Those are the number symbols you know, as well.

There are a couple of features one wants to have for base. First off, there's balance between how many symbols humans can memorize, and how tedious it's to write numbers. With base-2, 128 is 10000000. That's a bit much maybe?

Second, base being divisible makes mental arithmetic way easier with divisors of that base. 10 is divisible by 2 and 5, and it's easy to see how multiplying by 5 tends to be easier that multiplying by 3 or 6."	1	0

A base 10 system and positional notation are not connected. You can have base 10 without positional notation and positional notation  without base 10.


The roman numeral that are base 10 have been used from 900 BC or earlier and the Greek numera base 10 are as old.  The indian-arabic numerals started to be used in Europe at year ~1000

So the roman was used in ~1900 years in at least som part of Europe and the indian-arabic numerals have have been used for ~1000 yeas.

So I would consider it strange to argue that we use base 10 because of the introduction of indian-arabic numerals when Europe already have used a base 10 system for ~1900 years. The indian-arabic numerals have only been used for ~half the time as the Roman and both use base 10.

The Egyptian system that is  base 10 have been used in the area have been used since 3000 BC

What we can say is that the indian-arabic numerals  are why we use a positional notation today. But the usage of positional notation and base 10 are not connected since base 10 was  the standard when indian-arabic numerals was introduce.

If the roman system had used bas 12 and that would have been the common system in Europe when we was exposed to indian-arabic numerals. The alternative for a conversion to positional notation that is superior is to change the base used from 12 to 10 or continue to use bas 12 but with positional notation by adding two extra symbols. Changing base is hard to do but adding two extra symbols is easy because 10 new symbols was introduced why not introduce 12.


If you understand positional notation in base 10 it is trivial to do the same in base 12. So I would argue that the reson for base 10 is that the roman system that become dominant used bas 10.  Positional notation  was introduce with indian-arabic numerals and we continued to use base 10. If the roman or the indian-arabic system had a different base we would likely have continued to use the base of the roman system because that is simple to do compared to change to a new base.

We are literally using indian-arabic numerals. We aren't using roman numerals. While there may have been other number systems that have been in use before indian-arabic numerals, the numerals we use today are indian-arabic numerals.

Same as other charging cables, the usb c is just another type of cable to provide data and power. Each device has a specific power input they need to charge and operate. That is why you have a power brick/adapter for most devices. Laptops for example, are small because the hefty transformers needed to change outlet voltage (typically 110volts at 60hz in NA) to what the laptop needs, generally lower voltage (converted to DC) and the proper amperage. The conversion takes big components and produces lots of heat, which is why they are designed as a separate item.

As to WHY they have variable outputs, its just easier to make chargers with a range than a very specific spec. You can charge a phone at 5v at 2 amps just as easy as with a charger that does 5v at 1a. One deciding factor is whether the charger has the components for such high current. The second being whether your phone or laptop or battery charger can handle the input. They have circuitry to withstand x amount of power at x rate. if you exceed it, it can damage your components instantly or over time. this is why they tell you to use only OEM chargers and I've seen dollar store chargers fry phones in this manner before. There is power protection circuitry (think fuses) but most of the time if something goes, it bricks your phone. Some technology in laptops/phones will disable the circuit and refuse to charge with a message like ""check battery""

You can use all the chargers you just mentioned within reason since the difference is only a few watts, but the excess power (if not used) gets turned to heat and can cause issues down the line. Bottom line is, your electronics say ""Hey I only need 45 W of power"" so they wouldnt take 20V at 3A (60W)

The most important part to pay attention to would be proper voltage. You wouldnt want to put 20V charger onto a 5V circuit every day. Yes it will work and charge, but thats not what the engineers designed it for. Hope that answers the question without rambling too much.

No. Charger wattage is a maximum. If a charger can provide up to 65 W and your device only needs 5 W, then it'll get the 5 W. 

The only real consideration here is that chargers aren't equally efficient at all ranges, and that higher power chargers are bigger. So a 65 W charger is more inconvenient to carry, and using it to charge a cell phone may waste some small percentage of power vs using a lower power charger. However since phones use very little power the waste can be ignored in most situations.

&gt; Why do some chargers have variable Volt outputs, and how does this work?

Ohm's law. The amount of power lost by sending it through a cable depends on the cable's resistance (which depends on the thickness) and current going through it. So if you want to send 65W and keep a low voltage, the cable would need to be thick. If you want to have thin wires, you have to increase the voltage.

&gt; Am I destroying everything or are we at a point in time where modern devices and chargers can limit power input and output using USB PD?

It's all negotiated automatically. The only problem here is that a too weak charger won't be able to charge your laptop, and carrying a laptop charger around to charge your phone will take more room in your pocket for no additional benefit."	37	0

But in practice, you're talking about a USB cable, which has a strictly-defined standard to follow and doesn't simply dump 20v all the time. Instead, it connects at the minimum voltage for the spec, which is 5 volts and safe for everything. Then it actually communicates with the device to determine if it's safe to jump to a higher power setting.	2	0

So, lots of reasons. Let's get started.

The first reason is that evening air during the summer usually comes with a reduction in wind. If you're living in a dusty area, such as a city with lots of concrete or a rural place that's off a dirt road, all the wind dying means the dust or grit settle out, and the air ""feels"" cleaner and no longer carries the smell of all that dirt.

Second, sun bakes asphalt surfaces and makes any spilled gas, tar or rubber on them smell stronger. At night, this heating effect goes away and so does its acrid smell (as does a lot of car exhaust). You might not notice it being there during the day, but you will likely notice it not being there as much at night.

Next, the air's moisture content goes up and its temperature goes down. We smell things much better when the air is moist. You can see this yourself by going out of a room where someone had a shower with scented soap and then going back into it - the wave of moist air smells a lot stronger - or going into a room with an indoor chlorinated pool. This can be amplified a LOT if there's a late-day shower that passed through.

And a lot of night-flowering plants like jasmine have really nice smells because they rely on scent rather than visible light to attract the types of creatures that pollinate them. A summer's evening near a jasmine hedge is wonderful.

Probably other reasons too."	797	0

The summer night smells peaceful because no one is outside.  When people are outside they fart a lot because they think it will just blow away in the wind, but it adds up and makes the air smell of combat.  Nothing like people going inside to make a night smell peaceful.

Bonus question:  If someone from 2000 BC time travelled to 2018, would the air smell like horrible sewage (because of all the farts that have occurred in the past 4000 years)?"	5	1

In your case, you have a drafty barn. But even in a gale, there won't be more than a gently draft in the barn - not enough to lift dust from the surface. When there is a gale, dust will be blown into the barn, and when that dies down to a normal breeze, there won't be much air movement in the barn, and it will settle.

But it very much depends on how the wing is oriented when an aircraft is resting on its wheels. There is a zero-lift axis for each wing, and if the wing is moving parallel to the direction of the zero-lift axis, then no lift is ever created.

To make sure the aircraft will fly, the horizontal tail control surfaces (called the elevators) should be deflected slightly so that the tail itself will create a force that pivots the plane pitch upwards. This will guarantee the wing will eventually orientate itself slightly upwards (above the zero-lift axis), and thus create lift.

The wing are not small. For example a Boeing 787 dreamliner have a wing area of 377m^2 and the mid size 787-9 hav cabin area of 258 m^2. Even the larger and multi deck Boeing 747 and Airbus 380  have larger wing area the carbine area.

The size of the wing is depend on the mass they should be able to lift and the speed they should be able to operate at. Large aircraft have flaps and other movable parts on the wing that can change the shape and increase lift at low speed. Without them airplane would not be able to take off.

There is also a combination of drag vs lift and size of the wings. You can create a smaller wing that provide a lot of lift but have high drag so you need powerful engine and use a lot of fuel. A larger and primary high wingspan can result in less drag.  A high wingspan wing will be heavy and expensive if it able to support a large aircraft and is a problem on the ground.  So you make a compromise.  The shape of the wing also depends in speed. 

The result is that a glider that is light and operate at low speed have high wingspan but a fighter aircraft that should work in supersonic condition have low wingspan compare to the mass and size of the rest of the aircraft.

The fact that is is only wind speed over the wing that is important can be a problem on the ground in high wind. Small aircraft like for example a common Cessna 172 have a stall speed of 40 knows. That is 20m/s and a wind at that speed is a gale a storm start at 24m/s. The numbers is for a aircraft with fuel and pilot, passengers and is lower if it is empty. The result is that you need to add extra weight to a aircraft, tie it down to the ground or store in indoors so it does not get airborne in high wind.

This can also happen to a lesser degree for large airplanes. Even  747 can get enough lift so the from wheel is lifted up in the air https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHhZwvdRR5c

The fallacy that often goes along with the Bernoulli equation is the equal transit time fallacy. In fact, the air over the top of the wing moves even faster than the ETT fallacy would suggest -- making the pressure even lower on top of the wing. But that doesn't mean that using the Bernoulli equation with an actual velocity field around the wing would give you the wrong answer.	1	0

As for the difference between an HMO and a PPO, there's an important concept to be known: a healthcare *network.*

This concept refers to a selection of doctors with whom the insurance provider has made arrangements to provide healthcare at a discounted rate.

A Health Maintenance Organization requires you to stay within that network; if you want to see a doctor who's not in the network, you pay the entire cost. Additionally, some HMOs require you to have a primary care physician who determines what care you need, and some require referrals to see a specialist.

On the other hand, a Preferred Provider Organization will allow you to claim benefits if you see an out-of-network provider, but usually at a reduced rate of benefits. That is, they'll pay less if you visit someone out of network. Most PPOs don't require a referral to see a specialist, nor require you to have a PCP.

HMOs typically have low (or no) deductibles and lower premiums than a PPO."	3	0

The individual who has purchased the policy from the insurance  pays a certain amount of money on a regular basis as agreed upon  between the insurer and the insured. In return, the insurance company  offers financial protection to the policyholder for any medical expenses  that may arise.

A health insurance policy  offers coverage for treatments that require a minimum 24 hours of  hospitalisation. While this is the basic benefit that is provided,  insurance companies also provide coverage for pre-hospitalisation,  post-hospitalisation, and certain day care procedures that do not  require 24 hours of hospitalisation.

Insurance  companies offer a whole lot of health insurance plans – each with a  specific objective. A few health insurance plans provide daily hospital  cash, a few offer coverage for critical illnesses, and a few others  offer plans specifically for senior citizens. Each of the plans varies  in the benefits provided and are hence priced differently.

**How health insurance works**

When  a person is hospitalised, he/she can ask the insurance company to pay  for the expenses or pay for the treatment himself/herself and later ask  for a reimbursement of the expenses incurred. The benefits of a health  insurance policy can be availed for planned hospitalisation as well as  emergency hospitalisation.

A policyholder is, in most cases, given two options when it comes to raising a claim.

* One  is the reimbursement option which allows the policyholder to submit all  the bills with regard to the hospitalisation and claim a reimbursement  of the expenses incurred for the treatment.
* The second type is  the cashless option which entitles the policyholder to avail all  necessary medical facilities and let the insurance company pay the bills  directly."	1	0

Drug companies do have lots of ads targeted at doctors (and lectures and in-person visits from sales people), but the ads you are talking about are aimed at patients. The companies figure that the drugs are much more likely to be prescribed if patients are asking their doctors about them. And they are right—these ads do work.

In some cases, you could argue that this is legitimate. People might have a problem that they didn't mention to their doctor because they didn't know there was a solution. On the other hand, some advertisements are questionable. Drug companies turn relatively minor conditions into a ""medical problem that needs a drug."" Without the advertising, your doctor might have told you to take a walk, but back on booze, lose some weight, or whatever, but now that you are asking about drugs, the doctor acquiesces and prescribes it for you."	7	0

Drug companies do market their drugs to doctors, but not through TV ads. No, the drug ads on TV are for patients. 

There are 3 reasons why drug companies market their drugs to consumers: Lack of doctor's awareness, patient self diagnosis, and physician reimbursement.

1. Lack of doctor's awareness. I hate to break it to you, but doctors are not the all knowing experts that you may believe they are. You have this assumption that doctors know best and they are always going to choose the best therapies for you, but this is not the case. First, physicians are working with incomplete information. Patients may not give full histories, laboratory and diagnostic information could be less revealing than ideal, and are many diseases that certain signs and symptoms may indicate. So sometimes doctors are not 100% sure of the disease that they are even treating, let alone understanding all of the patient specific characteristics that would lead them to making the perfect decisions.

That is one aspect and it can be a real challenge for physicians. The second part of doctor's lacking awareness is the challenge of staying current with best practices. There is a ton of information in medicine, more than any one doctor can know, and there is even more controversy. So in a given situation, 2 doctors who have read all of the same papers and have received the same exact training may make different decisions regarding therapy. Now compound that with not having complete information and we can see how variable medical practice can be. Often doctors are not 100% up to date on the latest best practices and may not be aware of new evidence. There is just too much information being generated these days. Perhaps in their area of interest within their specialty they read all of the new literature every month, but more often than not they peruse the headlines of JAMA and call it a day. If they then run into a clinical situation that they feel uncomfortable with they may dig deeper and review more of the literature, but imagine how challenging and consuming it would be to read every review in every publication of JAMA every month, Lancett, Cochrane, all of the new guidelines, plus every primary literature article in the hundreds of medical journals that comes out. It is just not possible.

So when a new drug comes to market, especially if it isn't a highly anticipated drug that is meeting a currently unmet need, doctors may not be all that familiar. There are around 100 new drugs that come to market every year for your reference. When this is the case, drug companies can advertise to patients who will then bring up the drug with their doctors. The doctors may think, ""Hmm, never heard of that drug, I should look it up."" In this way, drug companies can spread awareness about their drug. However, even after looking it up, doctors still may not be convinced to prescribe it over an alternative therapy that they have years of experience working with, but gaining awareness is the first step. For this reason, yes, advertising is good and it can help patients get better care.

2. Patient self diagnosis. Sometimes patients can be very good at self diagnosis. They know the whole story behind their condition and often in much greater detail than a physician. You sitting down for 15 minutes with a doctor and then having a couple tests run on you doesn't really tell the whole story of your ailment, does it? There is always more information than the doctor is considering and there are times when patients themselves can make the connection that perhaps a doctor wasn't thinking about. Sometimes patients really do know what is best for them. There is a movement in medicine to have patients be the center of medical decision making instead of doctors being the authority, and part of this is because patients are really the experts when it comes to knowing themselves. Drug companies can take advantage of this by advertising directly to patients. Depending on your disposition this can be both a good and bad thing.

3. Finally, physician reimbursement. Part of the whole patient centeredness movement is a focus on patient experience. Patient experience as they go through the medical system is very important. In fact, there have been numerous studies connecting better patient experiences with better health outcomes. This is highly multifactorial, of course, but bottom line is that patient experience matters when it comes to healthcare. Now, the payers of healthcare understand this and they have implemented incentives and penalties to the different actors within the healthcare system with the ultimate goal of improving patient experience. One example of this could be doctor visit surveys. Insurance companies create incentives in their reimbursement structures by offering more money to clinics that boast better patient experience scores. As you can imagine this is a powerful driver of clinic activity and many more resources have been devoted to ensuring good patient experiences.

Most of this has been very good for the patient, but one unintended consequence of this is a growing fear to disappoint or anger patients. If you are unhappy with the decision that your doctor makes, even it is *the best* decision for you, you may become disgruntled and fill out a survey giving the clinic a terrible rating for patient experience which will then lead them to losing money from your insurance company. Doctors know this and so they often want to have patients leave happy.

So, back to drug ads. Let's say a patient recently saw a drug ad, feels that this drug is the best for them, and proceeds to bring it up with their physician. Even if the physician doesn't think that the drug is the most optimal choice for the patient, they may still prescribe it because they want to protect their patient experience ratings and avoid disappointing patients. Drug companies know this and that is one reason why consumer directed drug ads are so effective.


In summary, drug ads are directed at patients, not physicians. They are both good and bad when it comes to patient health and there is in fact large controversy surrounding their use in the United States. Pharma will tell you how awesome drug ads are because they are arming patients with knowledge and the power to direct their own health and doctors will tell you that drug ads are terrible because it undermines medical integrity and leads to poorer outcomes. Interestingly enough, there are only two countries in the world where direct to consumer drug ads are legal: The United States and New Zealand."	6	0

It's a certain way of making, or looking at, art of any kind.  It's a vague but important concept, and many thesis papers have been written on the subject of ""What is Deconstruction?""

What it boils down to, in lay usage at least, is pretty much as you understand it.  Deconstruction i popular usage means taking the elements of a trope and either analyzing those elements individually, rearranging them or excluding some to make something new, or putting it in a new setting or theme.

The film *The Big Lebowski* can be seen as a deconstruction of the noir genre.  All the elements are there - a kidnapped damsel in distress, an underemployed male hero, organized crime, suitcases full of money.  However, all these elements are changed; the damsel kidnapped herself, the hero's a stoned slacker, the crime's a bunch of nihilists, the suitcase is full of Walter's whites.

The film *Primer* can be seen as a deconstruction of the time travel trope.  It focuses in on the technical &amp; grounded parts of time travel, eschewing the wild adventures the genre usually covers.  Instead, the realistic impact of time travel on a friendship is examined."	4	0

It is used straight - far straighter than normal, in fact - and is examined in great detail, usually to try and show what circumstances would cause the trope to manifest in real life and/or what the real-life consequences of this trope would be, revealing some flaws beneath, like saying, ""Be careful: this is what happens when you have this trope.""

&gt; Alternately, the trope can be used in a manner that differs greatly from its usual context. For example, many characters in comedies display behavior that, though played for laughs in the show, could in Real Life be the end result of a mental or social anxiety problem - Yanderes, Hard Drinking Party Girls, Tsunderes and Lovable Sex Maniacs, to name a few. A more serious show might play with these tropes by presenting identical characters as unstable or even dangerous.

I also suggest to read the section ""[Playing with a Trope](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope)"", where it's compared with other types of trope variations, and the (extense) [list of tropes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/namespace_index.php?ns=PlayingWith) using examples of them."	1	0

Trope subversion is like setting up the guy to slip on a banana peel, and instead having him do a complete backflip, land on his feet, and kick the banana peel. Or more humorously (perhaps), notice the banana peel, bend over to pick it up, and then as he grabs it have him still slip and fall as if he had stepped on it unaware.

Trope deconstruction would be more like having the guy slip on a banana peel, fall and break his shoulder, and then showcase his agonizing recovery process after a serious injury due to an unexpected fall.

The idea being that you're taking that trope and playing it straight, but really focusing in on the logical extremes of that trope, and what harmful effects it may have, versus setting up a trope that may be old/tired, and changing the expected outcome in a new and surprising way."	3	0

There are a number of different technologies that can be used to make smart glass.

Electrochromism is one of the technologies.  In simple terms, electrochromic glass has an electrochromic material embedded into the sheet of glass.  Electrochromic materials are molecules that change colour when they absorb or emit an electron from the molecule.  Pushing electrons through the glass causes some of the embedded molecules of electrochomic material to absorb or emit an electron, and those molecules then change colour.

That's the basic principle anyway."	2	0

Inventor/patenter of a Smart Glass technology here. 

Yes it’s real. You can even see some as your own personal villain on the Boeing Dreamlimer seats. There’s a lot of different kinds. 

1. Electrochromic (EC)
2. Suspended Particle Device (SPD)
3. Polymer Dispersed Liquid Crystal (PDLC)
4. Polarization Based (mine)

Since you asked about EC, it's kind of the worst of all 4. It's very expensive. It switches from clear to dark when power is applied. You have to keep applying power to keep it switched. You see it most often in rearview mirrors of luxury cars. 

It works essentially as a reversible chemical reaction. The reaction oxidized a violagen. The electricity reverses the reaction. It's basically a battery that changes color when charged. 

SPD is what's in Dreamliners. I know the guy who invented it. He made... a lot of money. SPD is a gel that gets darker when a current is applied. Essentially, the gel has a dark ink suspended in in it and when you apply a current, all the particles line up in columns and hide behind one another. 

PDLC is based on a liquid crystal—a material that also lines up with an electric field like the needle of a compass. Millions of them in the gel between the glass make the difference between a clear material and one that scatters light in a bunch of different directions — making it appear frosted. This material is fairly inexpensive and you can find it in law offices and some high end hotel bathroms. 

My technology was really simple. It relies on polarizers to allow or block light. Light has an orientation to it. A polarizer filters out all horizontal or vertical light. If you stack two of them, then rotate the second, they cross and the window goes dark. Instead of rotating, you can create a window that darkens when you slide one an inch up or down, by alternating strips of horizontal and vertical oriented stripes. 

Now, if instead of vertical and horizontal, you add the angles in between as a sinusoidal pattern, the window will go through shades of gray all the way to blackout. "	6	0

I've always wondered whether electrochromic glass could be used as a standin for pop-up headlights on cars. To do that however, they'd have to be safe and durable.

Like the glass would darkens to visually hide the headlights? It's currently made for automotive (a very difficult industry to break into) in rearview mirrors. You could talk to the company [Gentex](http://www.gentex.com/automotive/automotive-products). Or you could start aftermarket. 

EC comes in a really narrow range of colors. There is an exotic tech called electrowetting that might work to give a range of colors. It would be a science project because as far as I know, no one is making it. 

&gt;-Can electrochromic glass be made into curved surfaces?

Sort of. Yes it can be made. It would require large volume manufacturing as you would need to precisely control thickness. You can get films right now with 2D curves. But 3D curves will be hard. 

&gt; -Can it be tempered, laminated, or otherwise treated for different applications?

Laminating a 3D curve would be very difficult. I'm pretty sure you can just put EC on plastic. SPD definitely works on plastic. 

&gt; -Could it be applied to materials other than glass? Like acrylic or pyrex?

For headlights you'd want to use PC-ABS"	3	0

The expectations are set too low for what beginners are likely to actually do.  They are expected to fail but law of averages says that they only will half the time.

Beginners luck means : beginners tend to do better than people expect them to. it isn't really about the beginners though, it is an error in expectation.  The bar is set too low so lots of beginners seem to beat it.  More than half will do better than an expectation that is below the average.

Yes that is true, BUT if people consider action X to have too many weaknesses, they'll focus on other actions that are more successful, and if action X falls out of convention, they might even chose actions that are not even better against action X and focus on beating other conventional actions. Also take into account if the opponents don't know each other, it suddenly becomes a headgame if the experienced guy doesn't know that the other one is a novice.

Either you misunderstood or your friend misunderstood. You have four valves in your heart that keep blood from flowing backwards. Stenosis just means that the opening is too small causing the heart to have to work harder. There are a variety of reasons this may happen. The aortic valve is the one at the opening between the heart and your aorta. 	1	0

That being said it's not usually a word that gets used for that sort of thing. As others have explained and to refrain from complicating with detail,  it's one of the valves in your heart (aortic valve) becoming stiff. Stenotic valves still work, just not at 100% and it can be progressive depending on the cause. 	1	0

It's more of a rule of thumb that provides a ""first guess"" estimate when analyzing a situation.

Assuming you don't know anything about the situation, you can fairly safely guess that 20% of the cause makes 80% of the effect. For instance, you could guess that 20% of drivers cause 80% of accidents, 20% of your customers leave 80% of your complaints, 20% of your birthday party guests eat 80% of the cake, etc.

For instance, a programmer could use it to convince his boss to let him re-build some old code - after all, 80% of the bugs are probably caused by only 20% of the code.

The Pareto Principle is definitely not a substitute for real in-depth investigation - just a way to think about a situation. It means that in many situations, you can prevent 80% of your problems by focusing on the worst 20% of the people and things that cause them. 

It's also not even the best estimate. Businesses often use a 20-100-20 rule - for instance, the top 20% of customers contribute 80% of the profits, but the bottom 20% of customers actually lose the company 20% of their potential profits. 

Statisticians use a much better estimate called the 68–95–99.7 rule or empirical rule. In most sets of real-world data, about 16% will be very high, 16% will be very low, 2.5% will be extremely high, 2.5% will be extremely low, 0.15% will be ""off-the-charts"" high, and 0.15% will be ""off the charts"" low. This rule applies to people's IQ and height, household incomes, rolls of two or more identical dice, and tons of other examples."	2	0

Most ice cubes you see aren't clear, they're white.  This has to do with impurities and bubbles while solidifying.  But there is a way to make completely clear ice cubes (many companies are in business to provide clear ice), and it's done using a specific process.  In this process, when water crystalizes, the water crystals form in such a way that light doesn't diffuse while passing through.   The silica crystals that are made into clear glass do the same.  the light passes all in the same direction (I don't say pass through, because in both water and glass, the light gets refracted, but all in the same direction).	24	0

In quartz it's a crystal, a perfect lattice of interconnected molecules. In glass they're randomly arranged and frozen into place. 

It's clear to visible light because none of its atoms have electrons whose energy matches the wavelengths of visible light - if they matched, an electron could absorb that photon and store it as energy - so they just pass on through. However, it DOES match for infrared, so if you tried looking through glass with a thermal camera it would look solid. 

This is also the cause of the greenhouse effect - visible light goes through glass, hits something that CAN absorb it, it's re-emitted as thermal light, which is BLOCKED by glass, so the energy stays trapped and keeps warming up like a bucket filling with water faster than it drains."	20	0

This isn't really true. Glass is amorphous, and a liquid is amorphous. So yes, in a sense it's a frozen liquid. But if it's below the glass transition temperature it's very much a solid. It can't flow because the particles that make up the glass don't have enough energy to flow."	1	0

The confusion stems also from a misunderstanding. Glass and Liquid have the same structure, an amorpous structure. So in a sense, a glass is a frozen liquid, especially if you cool it so fast that no meaningful diffusion can take place. It's how liquids are sometimes studied (e.g. liquid metals). Metal glasses do exist. 

The thing is that this frozen liquid is still, well, frozen. It doesn't flow."	1	0

I wanted to answer an implicit question embedded in this question,

The properties of a material are influenced on a vast time and distance scale, from atomic (10^-9 m) to macro (10m), and from atomic vibrations (10^-13 seconds) to creep (hours, years, decades). 

What is essential is that the kind of atom that makes up a material is not the sole contributor to a materials' properties, but also what kind of atoms surround it, what configuration those atoms have, what configurations large groups of atoms have, etc etc etc. 

So something that does not appears transparent can become transparent when its structure changes."	1	0

Careful with this. The greenhouse effect is poorly named so that it doesn’t work when you try and flesh out the analogy like this. The Earth’s atmosphere doesn’t work like a literal geeenhouse. 

It’s also confusing because glass doesn’t block much infrared light at all - there are even infrared lamps made from glass. Actual greenhouses trap heat because the sunlight warms the air inside, but the air is not being blown away by wind, it’s more or less the same air that just keeps heating up more throughout the day."	3	0

You can see clearly through the most of it because it is transparent. Now, throw it onto the ground. The cup now shatters into smaller pieces. Pick those small pieces up and try to see through them. It's much harder now, right? Instead of looking transparent they look kind of shiny and reflective. It's because due to the internal reflection from their surface. The original cup also has this kind reflection, however, since they're much larger, the orientation of the surface does not change quickly, hence you have windows large enough to see through. Sand is just made of grains of SiO2, which glass mostly is, but much smaller than those pieces from the shattered glass, and much smoother, as they have been polished through long natural process. So under our eyes, sand would basically reflect all the coming light to random directiond, what a white object would actually do. If you use a microscope to look at the grains, you would find the grains transparent.

TL,DR: Sand is already transparent, it just look white because it's made of small grains and they refect all coming light to random directions."	1	0

It is literally causing hundreds of tiny explosions per minute using gas that is injected or vaporized.  Because of that there are parts of the engine and exhaust system that get very hot, hot enough to ignite gasoline vapors.  (Particularly the catalytic converter) And some of those parts run right by the tank receptacle. And while you are pumping gas you are literally creating a cloud of gasoline vapor and tiny droplets (this is why you can smell it while you pump and sometimes afterwards your hand stinks like gas even though you didn't get any on you).  So in essence not turning your engine off while pumping gas is like filling a bucket with gas right next to a fire.	0	0

The probability of a problem is low, but the consequences are very high.  Furthermore the consequences are imposed on all the people around you, who did not volunteer to participate in your experiment.

I don't usually cook with open containers and nozzles of gasoline sloshing around nearby.  If you do, you are a damn fool.

You answer a bunch of multiple-choice input questions about seemingly random topics ('What's your favourite breakfast cereal?', 'What's your favourite classic movie?', 'What did you want to be when you grew up?', and so on), and you get a response back at the end: let's face it, it being a Buzzfeed quiz, it's usually which Hogwarts house you belong in.

But shock, horror: after answering twenty questions honestly, Buzzfeed informs you that you are a Hufflepuff, when you *know* that you're actually (obviously) a Ravenclaw. So you take the test again. You change one answer, and boom! Now Buzzfeed tells you that you're the Ravenclaw you always knew you were meant to be.

But you start to wonder: just how many of the input questions could you change in order to change the output? Some of them won't make a difference to the result; it doesn't matter whether you prefer Coco Pops or Rice Krispies, because the Sorting Hat only uses that to determine between Gryffindors and Slytherins, and based on your other answers you are *obviously* neither. On the other hand, some of them will. No self-respecting Hufflepuff would ever answer that their favourite classic movie is *Inherit the Wind*, so flipping that answer will immediately flip the output and put you in a different house, without you changing the answer to any other question.

*That's* the sensitivity of a system. If there are three individual answers you could switch that would each change the output, we say the system has a sensitivity of -- you guessed it -- three. (In computer science terms, this is usually considered as a sort of true-or-false, 1-or-0 example, but the basic idea is the same: how many true-or-false inputs can you flip to change the true-or-false output?) This is a way of measuring just how complex the system is. There are other measures of complexity, but over time they were mathematically proven to be polynomial in nature. (That contrasts with it being *exponential* in nature, which would have set it apart from other complexity measures as being much more complex and requiring more time and effort to compute. You don't need to worry *too* much about what that means to get a surface understanding of what's going on; just understand that people suspected it might be polynomial like all the others, but hadn't yet proved it.) 

The conjecture, and I'm really ELI5ing it here, is about whether or not the rules for sensitivity follow the same rules as other measures of complexity, or whether it's a weird outlier. The short version is yes, it follows the same rules. (If you want to get particular about it, what was proved was that 'every 2^n-1 + 1-vertex induced subgraph of the n-dimensional cube graph has maximum degree at least √n', which is comfortably above my paygrade and well out of the remit of ELI5.)

The reason why it's so significant is because this was one of those problems that anyone who's anyone in the field had tried to make even incremental progress towards in the past thirty years, but had generally failed. Along comes Huang, and produces a proof that's two pages long -- that is to say, extremely elegant. It's the computer science version of a team of cryptozoologists spending decades searching for Bigfoot, and then the new guy on the team says, 'Wait, you mean Harry? Hairy guy, kind of blurry, lives in the woods? Yeah, he's on my bowling team. He's cool.' (In actual fact, the solution goes above and beyond what would be needed for a proof, so it's opened up several new interesting questions; it's closer to the new guy saying, 'Yeah, Harry's on my bowling team. Last week he brought the Loch Ness Monster and the Chupacabra. We went out for tacos. Nice guys. Want me to give you their Snapchat?')

That's why people are talking about it. It's not a *colossal* leap forward in terms of changing the field, but it's impressive that it was solved and that the solution was so neat."	15638	0

&gt;But the proof was simple enough for Mathieu [Claire Mathieu, of the French National Center for Scientific Research] and many other researchers to digest in one sitting. “**I expect that this fall it will be taught — in a single lecture — in every master’s-level combinatorics course**,” she messaged over Skype.

That's part of the reason why this is such a big deal. There are proofs to unsolved problems that require the invention of *entirely new* forms of mathematics. This isn't one of them. People were expecting the solution to be almost book length, but in actual fact, someone [quite literally put the entire proof in a tweet](https://twitter.com/BooleanAnalysis/status/1145837576487612416)."	124	0

The problem is the conflation of 'simple' and 'easy'.  in general usage, they mean the same thing, but in harder sciences, 'easy' means 'an amateur could do it' and 'simple' means 'this expression covers even the edge cases'.

Easy: a^2 +b^2 =c^2 .  (requires specific conditions about the state of the 2-dimensional triangle in question--specifically a and b being sides surrounding a right angle)

Simple: c^2 = a^2 +b^2 +2ab*cos θ  (This covers the length of any triangle side on a Euclidean two-dimensional plane, if you know the length of the other two sides and the spread of the angle between them.  In the specific case of finding the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle, it simplifies to the 'easy' version because cos (π/2) is equal to 0.)

The simple version of the Pythagorean Theorem is clearly more advanced than the easy one, and Pythagoras and his many disciples probably didn't know it (though it's possible some of them did).  Even the Simple version had some important limiting factors--it would be worthless on a curved two-dimensional surface except as a good approximation at the very small level (noticeable errors creep in on city level surveying, for instance, though anything under, say, 500 feet might be off by less than the width of whatever you're using to mark the points of interest with, on Earth)

Redstone is a very simple, straightforward way to make specific simulations of electronics.  It has rules that are easy to understand, and can be used to make logic gates (allowing for things like in-game video game consoles to be built).  Easy redstone contraptions are just that: easy.  Press this button beside the door and the door opens.  That piston pair that pushes you down so you can crawl into your 1-block-high hidden house is simple.  I could tell you what you need for it, and how, and why, and you could puzzle it out fairly easily, even without an instructional video or someone telling you.  Advanced things like LUA computers are well beyond that level, but are possible, if you study long enough and practice."	37	0

And n^c (where c is a constant and n the number of inputs) is also completely undoable for large c (with large honestly starting at 4 or 5 already if we're talking about big n). Polynomial is easy compared to exponential, but it's still not good enough for big numbers (although for a lot of problems we have to accept a quadratic or cubic solution)
Linear is easy, or linearly logarithmic is close, polynomial is bad beyond n^3 and exponential should be avoided in all possible cases

Edit: this is a theoretical clarification, I know that in reality any polynomial solution gets pruned by heuristics, and almost nothing beyond n^3 is considered an acceptable solution."	28	0

Just for fun I'm going to try my hand at breaking this down and ELI5ing it. (I know you (/u/portarossa) probably understand it, or could understand it with a bit of googling, so this is more addressed to readers of your comment. Hopefully someone will get something out of it.)

First, what is a graph? A graph is a list of points (aka vertices) and edges that connect two vertices. Depending on how you want to use them, vertices and edges may have labels, and edges may have a direction (e.g. a directional edge from vertex A to vertex B is not the same as a edge from vertex B to vertex A). Graphs can be used to model all sorts of things, from relationships between people in social networks to Sudoku puzzles. In short, a graph is just a formal mathematical way to represent relationships among a group of something.

Next, now that we know what a graph in general is, what is an ”n-dimensional cube graph""? In a cube graph every vertex is labeled with a binary ""word"". The n-dimensional part refers to the length of the word, e.g. a 3-dimensional cube graph is for words that are three characters long. A binary word is just a string of 0s and 1s, e.g. `010` is one of those 3-dimensional words. An n-dimensional cube graph has one vertex for every unique n-length binary word. So a 1-dimensional cube graph has two vertices: `0` and `1`, while a 2-dimensional cube graph has `00`, `01`, `10`, and `11`. The other thing that makes a graph is the edges, so what are those? In an n-dimensional cube graph there are (non-directional) edges between every pair of vertices whose labels differ by exactly one character. For example, when n=3, `010` and `011` will have an edge between them, while `010` and `111` will not, because they differ at two places (the first and last character). You may find it helpful to see a visualization of this, so [this article](http://mathonline.wikidot.com/cube-graphs) has pictures showing the 1, 2 and 3-dimensional cube graphs in full.

Now, one thing to mention is the number of vertices and edges in a cube graph. The number of vertices is exactly equal to the number of unique binary words of length n. This just so happens to be 2^n, because there are n characters and each one has two possibilities, so when counting up all the possibilities you get `2 * 2 * 2 * ... * 2` n times, which is 2^n. (I know this may not be entirely convincing to non-mathematicians, but to explain it more clearly in a simple way would take too much typing for what is a fairly minor point). As for the number of edges, each vertex has exactly n edges, because the words are n characters long and an edge exists with every word that differs by exactly one character, so for each word there are n places that can be changed to make a new edge.

Now let's talk about the word ""degree"". With graphs, the degree of a vertex is simply the number of edges connected to that vertex. So in a cube graph, each vertex is connected to n edges, meaning every vertex has degree n. The maximum degree of a graph is the maximum of all of the individual vertices in the graph. So in a cube graph the maximum degree is n, because every degree is n.

Next, it's subgraph time. A subgraph is a graph that can be seen as a ""part"" of a larger graph. There are a few ways to create subgraphs out of graphs, but for this we only have to talk about one: the ""vertex induced"" subgraph. A vertex induced subgraph is when you pick any number of vertices from the starting graph, then add all the edges from the starting graph where the vertices for the edge are both part of the subgraph. So, if I were to make a vertex induced subgraph of the 2-dimensional cube graph and I chose vertices `01` and `11`, then I would also include the edge between those two vertices because it existed in the parent graph, but I would not include the edge between `01` and `00`, because `00` was not chosen to be part of the subgraph. The total subgraph in this example would just be two vertices (labeled `01` and `11`) and an edge between them.

Edit: I should note that it's possible for a subgraph formed in this way to be disconnected, which means that there may be two or more segments that have no vertices connecting them. This is fine, it doesn't matter if the subgraph is connected or disconnected within this particular problem.

So a ""2^n-1 + 1 vertex induced subgraph of the n-dimensional cube graph"" is a subgraph where you choose 1 more than half of the vertices (remember, there are 2^n vertices in the cube graph, so half is 2^n / 2 = 2^n-1), and then include all the edges from the original graph that still have vertices in the subgraph.

And then what was proved was that for every such subgraph, no matter which vertices you choose, the maximum degree is at least √n. In other words, you cannot choose any set of 2^n-1 + 1 vertices to make it so that every vertex is connected to less than √n other vertices. There will always be at least one vertex with at least that many edges. In other other words, if you choose more than half of the binary words of length n, there will always be at least one word that differs by exactly one character with at least √n other words in your chosen set.

Hopefully I've now explained the literal meaning of that statement in a way that most adults could understand, though I'm sure an actual 5 year old would lose interest halfway through the first paragraph. What I haven't touched on is how exactly the truth of that statement ties into the idea of sensitivity that /u/portarossa explained so very well. The reason for that is that I don't actually know, so while I have a vague idea I'd need to do more research to be sure I get it, and I also suspect that explaining it would be an even longer trek than this one was."	340	0

Here’s an example:

Say you have five random playing cards, and you want to put them in order from least to greatest. How many steps does that take? Let’s also assume you’re a robot who is very methodical and can’t remember too many things at once.

So first you look for the lowest card. You have to look at all five cards to find it, so that’s five steps. You put it at the front of the line.

Then you look for the second lowest card. You already put the lowest card where it should be, so there are four left. Four more steps to find the second lowest. Then three, then two, then one.

Sorting 5 cards took 5+4+3+2+1 = 15 steps. That is, you had to add up the numbers from 1 to 5. There’s actually an equation for the sum of the first x numbers, which is x \* (x + 1) / 2

So sorting x cards using this method takes x \* (x + 1) / 2 steps. Expand that out and you have 1/2 x^2 + x / 2 which is a polynomial. Hence we say this sorting algorithm has *polynomial* complexity, but you don’t actually have to solve this polynomial per se."	18	0

A linear problem would be one where the number of steps you need to do to solve it is a multiple of how big the problem is. Counting how many items are in a list, for example. Ten items in the list, ten steps to count them. Complexity *n*. If the problem is to generate ten different synonyms for each item on the list, it's 10n because you need to do 10 things n times. More complex, still linear.

A polynomial problem is one where the number of steps you need to do to solve it is dependent on the size of the problem multipled *by itself*. Suppose you have a list of items and you need to count every way two of those items can be combined. You pick the first item, and combine it with the entire list in turn, and that's n steps. You pick the second item and do the same and that's another n, and now you're at 2n total. Once you've got to the end of the list you've racked up n\*n steps - n^2. That's a polynomial problem, but solving it only required picking through a list, you never actually had to do any maths. It's just a description of how many steps were necessary.

Exponentials are where the number of steps you need to do is some number raised to the power of the size of the problem. Absolute nightmare. Can't think of any decent examples."	36	0

I'm no Hawking, however. I'm just a dude who's wicked smaht and has read his share of Gordon Wood. I.e. I might be wrong but I try hard.

Take a basic cube. It's three-dimensional. It has eight points, also known as vertices, which is the plural of vertex. So you've got eight points across three dimensions. A ""vertex induced subgraph"" is basically what you get if you remove some number of points and draw lines connecting those that are remaining.

For example, wherever you're imagining points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 on the cube, imagine that three of the points are removed. What you have is a 5-vertex induced subgraph of a 3-dimensional cube (and yes, cubes can exist in higher dimensions; a tesseract is what it's called in the 4th dimension, for instance, and it has 16 vertices; but let's stick with the standard cube).

A 2^**n**-1 +1-vertex induced subgraph in this case (where the dimension of the graph is **n** and **n**=**3**) would be a subgraph with (2^(**3**-1) +1=2^2 +1=4+1=) 5 vertices. So in the case of the cube, the conjecture makes a statement about all ""5-vertex induced subgraphs"" (i.e. all possible combinations of five points on the cube, including the lines that join them). And this conjecture is saying that the maximum ""degree"" of such a subgraph is at least √n (which is √3 in this case, which is a little more than 1.7). Degree means the number of lines by which one point in the subgraph is connected to other points. In our example, the degree of each vertex is 4 because each vertex (point) connects to four others, all in different directions. (I don't know if maximum degree is ever different from degree, but in this case, they are the same since all vertices have the same degree.) 4 is more than √n=√3 (which, again, is a little more than 1.7). So the prediction of the conjecture is satisfied in the case of the 3-dimensional cube.

I can't begin to imagine a fourth spacial dimension, so I won't go too far into it, but, as mentioned earlier, the **4**-D cube has 16 vertices, and the 2^n-1 +1-vertex induced subgraphs of that cube (the tesseract) are all the groupings of (2^**4**-1 +1=2^3 +1=8+1=) 9 of its vertices. And the conjecture states that all such subgraphs will have a maximum degree of at least √4, which equals 2, meaning that the vertex with the highest number of lines connecting to other vertices will have at least 2 such lines, which frankly seems a little obvious.

The conjecture states that this follows for all dimensions of ""cubes"". I do not know if that includes the 2-dimensional ""cube"" -- i.e. the square -- but some quick math says that the conjecture is satisfied in that case. Nor am I sure whether the number of dimensions can be a non-integer, like 3.6 or 22.1. 

I hope I'm right about this."	9	0

Let's do 2-dimensional, since that is easy to visualize.

A 2-dimensional cube is a square. A graph (in this context) is a set of nodes and edges that connect those nodes. A 2-dimensional cube graph is a graph representing a square, in a well defined manner. The nodes of the graph are the corners - so there are four. The edges off the graph are the edges of the square - so there are also four and each node has two edges:

    A --- B
    |     |
    |     |
    C --- D


A vertex induced subgraph means we take a graph and pick some of the nodes from it. We also get all the edges that connect nodes that are in our selection. 

So in our square we could make a vertex induces subgraph by picking A and B, we would get two nodes and one edge:

    A --- B

We could instead pick A and D, we would get two nodes and no edges:

    A
    
    
          D


So a 2^n-1 + 1-vertex induced subgraph of the n-dimensional cube graph means we take such a graph and pick that many nodes (called vertices). In our square example n=2, so 2^(2-1) + 1 is 3. So we pick three vertices. We could pick A, B, and C and get:

    A --- B
    |
    |
    C


The degree of a node in a graph is the number of edges it has. The maximal degree of a graph is the maximum of the degrees of all the nodes. So our square graph has a maximal degree of two. The subgraph in which we picked A and B has a maximal degree of one. The subgraph in which we picked A and D has a maximum degree of zero. And the subgraph in which we picked A, B, and C has a maximal degree of two.

So the claim is that no matter which vertices you pick to create your subgraph the maximal degree will always be at least √n when you pick 2^(n-1) + 1 vertices.

Again for our square 2^(n-1) + 1 is three, and √n is about 1.4. Since degree is always an integer, the claim is that no matter which three vertices you pick you will always have a maximal degree of at least 2. We can see that is true - we have to pick both neighbors of one node, there's no other way to choose 3 out of 4, and that vertex will have a degree of 2.

If we think about 3 dimensions. The graph has 8 vertices and 12 edges (look at a six sided die and count them...). It has a maximal degree of 3 - since each corner of the cube has an edge to three other corners. 2^(n-1) + 1 is 2^(3-1) + 1 which is 5.  √n is about 1.7. So the claim is no matter which 5 vertices you pick you will always have at least one vertex with two or more edges.

We pick our first corner. There are only 2 corners of a cube that don't have an edge to the corner we picked, so we have to pick 2 other corners to make 5, both of which will have an edge to our first corner. So no matter how we do it we get a degree of at least 2.

I'll leave 4 dimensions as an exercise...

I'm sure that cleared it right up and you couldn't have less understanding than before I typed that :)"	8	0

But as yet they don't exist because they depend on an imaginary black box polynomial algorithm that solves a different NP-complete problem, and no such algorithm has been found (and probably are not actually possible).

But yeah, real-world high exponent algorithms aren't exactly common, probably because in most cases people will try to find ways to simplify the problem so they can use a better algorithm.

So way back when -- 300 BCE, ish -- a smart Greek fellow named Euclid set out five postulates about geometry. The first four are pretty simple, often to the point that it seems as though they didn't even need to be stated:

* You can draw a straight line between any two points.

* Once you've got a straight line, you can extend it onwards to infinity.

* If you've got a straight line segment, you can use it to draw a circle where one end of that segment is in the centre and the other one is at the edge; basically, you can use it as a radius.

* One right angle is the same as every other right angle.

There's also the fifth, which is... trickier.

* If you get two straight lines that are crossed by a third line, and the sum of the angles between those two lines and the line that crosses them have an angle of less than 180 degrees, [those lines *must* cross at some point on that side](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9e/Parallel_Postulate.svg/1280px-Parallel_Postulate.svg.png), no matter how far away it is. This is also called the [parallel postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate), and a lot of people spent a long-ass time trying to prove it's true in the same way you can prove the others to be true, but never quite managed it.

Now these rules all seemed to work, and Euclid wrote what was basically the OG book on geometry -- *The Elements* -- that set out all the cool shit you could do. The first 28 of his examples could be shown to hold true only using the first four postulates... but then there's [number 29](https://mathcs.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookI/propI29.html). He couldn't make it work using the first four postulates on their own, and so had to bring in the fifth -- the one he couldn't prove. Still, it seemed to work OK. All of the rules held firm. There were no contradictions in it. Everything was great.

That is, until 1823. That's when two other mathematicians, Janos Bolyai and Nicolai Lobachevsky, both separately realised that you didn't *need* the fifth postulate to be true. If you treated it as though it wasn't, you could form mathematical systems that were still internally consistent; they just didn't look like Euclid's version of geometry. The maths held up, with no inherent contradictions, but it didn't look like what we see in 'real life'.

Think about it in terms of drawing lines on a sphere, like lines of latitude: two lines that are parallel at the equator will meet at the poles, even though they have interior angles of 180 degrees exactly. If you're looking at geometry that isn't on a plane -- non-Euclidean geometry -- then other weird stuff starts to happen. Imagine starting at the North Pole, walking south until you hit the equator, turning 90 degrees to the right, walking forward a quarter of the way around the planet, turning 90 degrees to the right, then walking until you reach the North Pole again. You just sketched out a shape made out of three straight lines where the internal angles add to 270 degrees -- which, in strictly Euclidean terms, you shouldn't be able to do.

Behold: new maths."	26	0

&gt;When Huang’s paper landed in Mathieu’s inbox, her first reaction was “uh-oh,” she said. “When a problem has been around 30 years and everybody has heard about it, probably the proof is either very long and tedious and complicated, or it’s very deep.” She opened the paper expecting to understand nothing.

&gt;But the proof was simple enough for Mathieu and many other researchers to digest in one sitting. “I expect that this fall it will be taught — in a single lecture — in every master’s-level combinatorics course,” she messaged over Skype."	4	0

Next think of how many corners that cube will have, a square has 4, a cube has 8, so that starts to look like 2^n. Then realize that 2^n divided by 2 can be rewritten as 2^(n-1). Now you can see that the first expression there, 2^(n-1)+1 is just a way of saying ""half the number of corners plus one"". Now imagine you color every corner red or blue, if you think about that for a bit you realize that you can have up to half the corners be red while having no red corner touch another red corner. (On a square, you could have two corners diagonal to each other be red, so they don't touch. Add a third red corner and you can see how then the red corners will have to be touching at some point.)  The proof then says that when you add that extra red corner, the ""half+1"" corner, that you can decide the minimum number of other red corners it has to touch. It proves that this number is equal to √n.  With the square example you can see it's true, adding a third red corner would make it touch two others, and 2&gt;√2."	8	0

As far as how this touches on sensitivity, here's a guess. Imagine if we had included only half the vertices of the hypercube into our subgraph. Then we'd lose dimensionality. So we're looking at the smallest subgraph such that we still need the full machinery of the hypercube to characterize it, and seeing what the addition of what even one additional vertex, possibly relatively on its lonesome, will do to the system.

Suppose you have a standard 3-dimensional cube with lights on all the corners, and you want to wire it to make a single circuit so that at least half of the lights are switched on. Wires can only go along the edges of the cube - no diagonal tricks, and any two adjacent lights that are both switched on are always connected by a wire. Then at least one light will have at least 2 wires going into it. (Aside: If you think, the largest single circuit you could make for which all lights only have 1 wire going in has only 2 lights. Can you make a circuit of 4 lights where the maximum number of wires for a single light is 2?)

Now suppose instead of a 3-dimensional cube, it's an n-dimensional cube, but you still want to wire it so that at least half of the lights are switched on. Again, wires can only go along the edges of the cube and any two adjacent lights that are both switched on are connected by a wire.

Huang decided to request a grant from the National Science Foundation to explore this idea further.

&gt;Then last month, as he sat in a Madrid hotel writing his grant proposal, he suddenly realized that he could push this approach all the way to fruition simply by switching the signs of some of the numbers in his matrix. In this way, he was able to prove that in any collection of more than half the points in an n-dimensional cube, there will be some point that is connected to at least √n of the other points — and the sensitivity conjecture instantly followed from this result."	12	0

For centuries, mathematicians would encounter a unique problem, the square root of a negative number.

Square roots is a simple concept, but the square root of a negative number was baffling to many brilliant mathematicians. 

Until some of them came with a simple concept: What happens if you represent √-1 as i?

This opened up a whole realm of possibilities and an entirely new number system. Not to mention the importance of it as a mathematical and engineering tool. One application that fascinates me the most is its use to identify the power lost during transmission of electricity."	6	0

One problem with your metaphor is that the subgraph does not have to be connected. That is, your supposition of a ""single circuit"" is incorrect. Another minor point is that you must choose *more* than half of the vertices (the actual proof is for exactly 1 more than half, but it will hold true for any amount more than half).

As a counterexample that highlights why both those points are important, if you take the 3d cube, you can choose two pairs of vertices that aren't connected to each other (think opposite edges across the diagonal). e.g. vertices `000`, `001`, `111` and `110`. Then the max degree of that graph is 1, which is less than √3, but that doesn't contradict the proof because the number of vertices is only half. If you added one more vertex then it must connect with at least one of those existing 4, bringing the max degree up to 2 &gt; √3, which matches the theorem.

To be fair I didn't explicitly say that the subgraph might not be connected, so it's understandable that you didn't realize that. Disconnected graphs are not very intuitive, so I really should have called it out."	17	0

Let's imagine these example, imagine you have 3 function

2) y=2x^2

3) y=0.5x^x

If you give x as small number as like 2 then y is still relatively small number for all of them, now imagine set x as 1000 even 10000, the number 3 y value will be very very massive. Now imagine that your PC need to do some job as much as *y* given any input *x*, then it's easy too see that #1 is very nice, #2 is still okay, but #3 is a definitely no-no for big x

Suppose you want to check which subset(s) of the list satisfy a certain property (e.g., optimal for a certain purpose), and suppose there's no shortcut to arrive at the answer, then you'd have to go through all possible subsets of the list, of which there are exponentially many (in terms of the number of objects in the list).	5	0

I was repeating an observation that one of my physics professors made that no exponent in any law is irrational (AFAIK). Also the fundamental laws (i.e. non-empirical laws) tend to have small exponents.

I think my buddy and I were discussing the anthropic principle to figure out if that could be a reason why our universe seems to be so nice."	1	0

Per Kennertron's reply, the brute force solution - simply enumerate all the permutations of the route you could take and pick the best one - is in factorial time, where it takes n\*(n-1)\*(n-2)\*...\*3\*2\*1 steps. A smarter approach is the Held-Karp algorithm, which can do it in O(2^(n)n^(2)), exponential time. It's an open question whether there's anything better!	2	0

O(1): no matter what n is, you can solve in constant time - 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

O(n): the time it takes to solve it increases linearly with n - 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

O^n: the time it takes increases exponentially with n - 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024,2048


Now think about the difference when n is a large number, let’s say 100:

O(1)=1

O(n)=100

O^n=2^100, about 1024x1024x4 times the number of atoms in the universe."	15	0

Most of the problems that people care about writing algorithms for are either O(1), O(log n), O(cn), or O( n^c ).

In some cases, linear time algorithms are treated like constant time algorithms for most purposes. 

In some languages (such as javascript, python, and PHP), memory lookup (reading a variable) is treated as O(1). It's not, it's O(cn), a linear complexity. But c is so small that it's treated as constant time.

In other cases we have incredibly useful problems that are NP-hard, like route finding.

What you're saying is technically true, but programmers generally don't even consider it a ""solution"" if it has a high exponent value in its complexity growth function.

It's technically true, but those solutions don't make to anyone's computer, because the programmers, managers, designers, and companies don't let those get out of development. They mark them as ""bugs""."	1	0

Edit: by request and after some more thought, I added an example of O(log(n)) using marbles.

Edit 2: I'm not super happy with O^n and I think it would be clearer to say:

* O^n: I hand you some numbered marbles. Count the number of ways can they be arranged
 * I hand you 1 marble.
 * You: ""1""
 * I hand you 2 marbles.
 * You: ""1,2;2,1 : 2""
 * I hand you 3 marbles.
 * You: ""1,2,3; 1,3,2; 2,1,3; 2,3,1; 3,1,2; 3,2,1 : 6""
 * I hand you 4 marbles.

Also, the point of the notation is to describe how the time required to solve a problem varies with the size of n (number is marbles in this case).

O(1) means it only ever requires a single step. If I hand you a bag containing 10 marbles or one containing 100, there is no difference in how long it takes to count them.

O(n) means the number marbles and the time increases at the same rate. 100 marbles takes 10x as long to count as 10 marbles.

O(log(n)) means that multiplying the number of marbles means adding a set bit of time. Solutions 10x as many marbles only takes 3 more steps, 100x only takes 6 more. 1000x takes 9 more.

O(N^2) means that each marble takes a bit longer to count than the one before. Counting the 11th marble takes a bit longer than counting the 10th. This means a noticeable delay will start creeping in as n goes up.

O^n means that the time increases much faster than the number of marbles. It takes 10x the time to count 2x the marbles. 100x to count 4x the marbles. It doesn't matter how fast your counters are because the fastest counters in the world can only tackle a slightly larger number of marbles. It means past a certain point, the problem takes a really long time, and at only a slightly higher number becomes impossible to solve.

This is super important in computers because an O^n algorithm might be blazing fast for the 1,000 records in your test system, but when you put it in production and the data grows to 10,000 it starts to take a couple seconds and at 100,000 records the system stops working altogether. Being able to recognize an O^n algorithm in the planning stage can save significant time and money from being wasted on something that turns into a brick wall only after the system is successful.

Imagine if someone wants to build an app that looks through it's users to tell you the shortest path from someone you know to someone you want to be introduced to. As the number of users increases, the difficulty to find an optimal path gets exponentially harder. So when you're testing this around the office it will work great and everyone thinks they are going to be billionaires after the IPO, but after you spend a bunch of money to get to production and attract a sizeable used base, the system no longer works at all."	179	0

O(1) means it that it doesn't matter how many items you have, it will take the same amount of time.  For instance, if you take a single picture of a number of objects, it doesn't matter how many objects there are, the picture takes the same amount of time. This makes a graph that has a straight line.

O(n) means it scales directly with the number of items.  So say you are taking a picture of each object individually.  Now it takes you the time of 1 picture if there's one object, 2 pictures for 2 objects, 3 pictures for 3, etc.  This looks like a line that rises with the number of objects.

O(n^2 ) (polynomial time) means that it takes you increasing amount of time for each one you add.  For instance, If you were taking a picture of each object from the position of every other object.  For 1 object you need one picture.  For 2 objects you will take a picture of 1 from object 1, of 1 from object 2, of 2 from object 1 and of 2 from object 2 for 4 total pictures.  For 3 you would take 1 from 1, 2 and 3, 2 from 1, 2, and 3, 3 from 1, 2 and 3 for 9 pictures.  If you had 4 objects it would take 16.  If you had 5 objects it would be 25. As a graph this looks like a line that curves upwards.

O(2^n ) is exponential time complexity. An example of this is if you had a number of objects that could be either on or off, but your goal is to take a picture of every possible state.  For one object there's 2 possibilities on or off, so you take 2 pictures.  For 2 there's the 2 possibilities of the first light, and for every state of the first light, there's 2 possibilities for the second, so it's 2x2 or 4.  For 3 there's 4 possibilities of the first two lights, and then two possibilities for the last light, so there's 4x2 or 2^3 pictures that need to be taken.  For 4 it would be 16. For 5 it would be 32.

If you made a graph of this you'd see that it accelerates more slowly than the polynomial graph until 4, where it curves even sharper.  The thing about an exponential graph is that the rate that the curve changes the higher the value. A polynomial graph's curve changes at a constant rate.  A linear graph's curve never changes.

The O means it's big O notation, which means that it is showing the fastest growing terms.  So you might have something that grows at a rate of 3^n + n^2 + 500n + 7 but in big O notation that would be O(3^n ) or more generally O(k^n ) meaning that it's exponential."	8	0

This and /u/Portarossa 's explanations are seriously top quality.  And I admit I'm looking forward to your explanation of how this is connected to the sensitivity concept that /u/Portarossa used :)

&gt; As for the number of edges, each vertex has exactly n edges, because the words are n characters long and an edge exists with every word that differs by exactly one character, so for each word there are n places that can be changed to make a new edge.

Each vertex has n edges, but the number of edges of a graph seems to be different, right?  (Not that this matters in understanding the sensitivity concept or the rest of your explanation.)  In the [link](http://mathonline.wikidot.com/cube-graphs) you provided, it already shows that for n = 2, we have 4 edges (not 2 edges for every 2^2 vertices = 8) and for n = 3, we have 12 edges (not 3 edges for every 2^3 vertices = 24).  I mean, it's trivial after writing the above, but I guess the number of edges in a graph is 

n (the number of edges for each vertex) * 2^n (the number of vertices) / 2 (divide out the ""double countings of verices) = n * 2^(n-1)

So would that be n * 2^n directional edges in a cubic graph, and n * 2^(n-1) non-directional edges in a cubic graph?"	1	0

If there are three individual answers you could switch that would each change the output, we say the system has a sensitivity of -- you guessed it -- three.

This isn't right (and it also the point where my own attempts to understand it on an intuitive level come unstuck).

The sensitivity of **the system AND that particular set of answers** is three.  For a different set of answers to the same questions, the sensitivity might be 0 or 20 or anything else.

""The sensitivity of the system"" apparently means the maximum sensitivity taken over all possible sets of answers.   If you could ELI5 how this latter value relates to the Sorting Hat's thought process or something, that would be great!

For example, what does it mean about the function if it has lots of high-sensitivity input sets and lots of low-sensitivity ones? Or what if almost all inputs are low-sensitivity and there is just one high-sensitivity one?  And why is the maximum value significant (as opposed to , say, the minimum value or the average)?"	2	0

You're right that a different set of answers might very well have a different sensitivity value, but as far as I can tell, what I wrote still holds up.

What computer scientists are generally more interested in is the [*influence*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_Boolean_functions#Influence) of an input question: given all of the possible input combinations, how likely is it that a given input is going to change the output? (You can think of this as the average sensitivity of an input in all possible combinations of inputs that might exist.) Does your choice of movie have more of an effect on which house you'll be sorted into than your choice of breakfast cereal, for example?

That is all in process, that management of it, is like saying that they are not using anything but Twitter to know about each other, that whole process is in their mind only fallacious in excluding they will draw in conjecture they can know about anything that isn't in simple physics. So to require anything but what in motion we have is a use of motion, we can draw in ""science"" using simple terms that we are requiring them not to know about anything in the other, that is a way of saying that only the draw on this conjecture can know, that man is attempting to steal something he does not know he cannot claim according to his conjecture, and that will require him to be able to steal then this conjecture is using him to require himself to create a use of real physics, and that will make him draw on the operations of the mind to require himself in the use of reality that he can know that in real life we only use in person what we may know we are able to draw from is the use of real things in the mind of something they concluded in real science is the available person of some other operation. And then that that is what is clear in this, the conjecture is without draw of another person claiming what was just written, this is tadamono69, the real institute in this draw is that they are not using their mind for this attempt at drawing conjecture. What they wish to mean is that they are using their own mind to guess at what another person is saying. They do not wish to think that they are knowing in things they will know at each other anything. They are simply attempting to state that they will attempt. The state of attempting will be that they can draw on Kinetic energy and that that is how they will use this physics, they will simply attempt to be in person for it to be revealed to anything they don't know about, they simply want to test at things they are not aware of it that since they can they will not be aware of anything they cannot actually prove, that whole process is that this is not for using physics, and then in mathematical draw they will outline to it other possibilities that they can think in interaction is their possible use of the scenario that this draws on. The public is using it already, they call it CRISPR sometimes and this whole plsatic thing that we are using for it, that is not a person that is not a phone, that is just that they are searching for something plastic, and that is why it doesn't sound good off of the phone and it never sounds good away from a device that has plastic in it, the best way to see this conjecture in effect take place is to use the lights in a room that are dimming and then create the conjecture far and deep enough to create them in a room that will in effect describe the room as in a hollow ""place"". Like that scene in batman where they use the sonar phones to find all the rooms and things like that, it is possibl, visualizing it isn't necessarily possible and there is no way to ascertain that that is nature they are not describing is their own nature, but then that we are using it to decsribe to ourselves anything but what is new in using that nature as describing something else, they are simply wishing to introduce something like people from Korea to a new country and that whole nature is not new. They will simply call it conjecture and then attempt that that is already real. And that is not a draw and it is not mathematical. It is already existing and it is called Darwinism. It's not simple but it's not real either. It's just too fake for reality and some people just want to watch the world burn and all that."	0	0

For example the statement “I like peanuts” is perhaps true for Joe but not for John. Hence this statement needs some pretty narrow assumption for it to hold.

Mathematicians try to figure out “true” statements under the least assumption they can make. This way they can establish a set of universal truths that could never break. So they can rest their mind and go: “ummm I can sleep well in the night counting this is always right.” They want more than “not creating inconsistency”. They want “this is always true”, like “humans can’t live forever” instead of “I like cereal”."	2	0

So a lot of what I'll say next is going to be speculation. I think a lot of math problems are simply derived from other, related, math problems. The sensitivity conjecture, for example, was based on the fact that other ways to measure some aspect of a boolean function's complexity shared a particular kind of relationship, so it seemed plausible that sensitivity did the same. It became famous probably because it is so simple a proposition, yet no one could find a proof for so long. In my opinion that's why most famous unsolved problems become famous: they seem so simple, and in some cases obvious, yet resist all attempts to formally prove them.

As for practical use, it depends on what you mean by practical I guess. Proving this conjecture will undoubtedly create new things to research, and will probably become a result that other proofs may rely upon, so it's practical for mathematicians at least ;). As for applications in other disciplines, I don't know. Boolean functions seem like a pretty useful abstraction for a lot of different applications, the example about the buzzfeed quiz being one. So knowing one more thing about the properties of boolean functions seems like it will probably also be useful, but maybe only in an indirect sense, where knowing that thing about the sensitivity allows them to prove something directly useful. But at this point all I'm doing is saying ""I don't know, maaaaybe?"" in a long-winded way, so I'll leave it at that."	1	0

To give that a little more context, there have been many complex problems in pure mathematics fields like number theory and abstract algebra which have been proved in modern times which require at least one of the following:

(1) Integration of such disparate other fields that many collaborating mathematicians are necessary

(2) some sort of computational aspect in which mathematical programming is both a large aspect of solving and a large aspect of the output

(3) a complete trail blazing of essentially new mathematics in unchaarterwd territory just in order to approach the problem

...which all results in mathematical proofs **which can be hundreds of pages long.** In such cases, it’s a safe bet to assume that no single mathematician can check this, but instead large swathes of the academic community check the bits most relevant to them and discuss amongst eachother before such a proof is accepted. 

This two page proof is what a mathematician would call elegant, or perhaps in this case even [one from the book](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Paul-Erdos#ref752819), a high honour indeed for any mathematical proof."	1	0

Imported foods are usually sprayed with a shitload of chemicals too to kill anything that could be there. A lot of those products (especially the high risk ones) are also regularly inspected and/or quarantined too

&amp;#x200B;

But with that random piece of fruit you're carrying in your bag they have no idea where it's come from or what it's been exposed to so they have no way of knowing what sort of risk it poses. Rather than trying to determine if each individual piece of fruit is safe it's easier (and cheaper and quicker) to just have a blanket ban on all fruits.

The individual risk that a piece of fruit you're carrying will be harboring a pest or disease is pretty low but if they let everybody cross borders with fruits than there would be a significant chance that eventually somebody would. Even with the controls they have in place there's still instances of nasties making it into new areas.

&amp;#x200B;

It is done to protect international trade but not in the way you're thinking - it's done to protect the local industries in the countries you're entering. Diseases and pests can spread quickly - especially if introduced into areas that have no natural controls for them - so trying to make sure they never make it into an area is easier (and quicker and cheaper) than trying to control them after the fact."	5	0

Today, we are the result of the fruit X avoiders.

Now, the same applied to other foods. Just by random chance (genetics is quite random by nature) some people liked coriander (aka cilantro) and other people didn't.

Draw a two-dimensional graph, X and Y-axis. Start at the origin (0, 0) and begin drawing one-inch lines on it. If you draw the line entirely on the horizontal axis you'll move one inch in the X direction and zero inches in the Y direction; likewise if you draw it entirely along the Y axis you'll move one inch Y and zero inches X. If you draw it at a 45 degree angle, through, you move less than one inch in both directions (specifically you'd move about 0.7 inches in each direction). At a 60 degree angle you'll again move less than one inch in either direction, but now you'll move a little more in one direction than the other. If your velocity remains constant you'll never move more than one inch per move in any direction, but **moving faster in one direction necessarily means moving slower in another direction.**

You can pretty easily expand this to three dimensions, and this is typically how we think about motion through space. But there's a *fourth* axis in reality, and that's time. If you move at a constant velocity through this four-dimensional axis, then you can see how moving faster in the three axes of space necessarily means moving slower in the time axis.

You might feel inclined to interject at this point that we *don't* move at a constant velocity: we're always speeding up, slowing down, plopping down for a rest, taking off again. But here's the kicker: **everything in the Universe constantly moves at C through spacetime.** Remember that when you're at rest you're not *really* at rest: you're sitting on the surface of a planet that's spinning, and that planet is orbiting around a star, and that star is orbiting around a galactic center, and that galaxy is moving in relation to other galaxies, and so on. Compared to all of the cosmic movement you experience at any given moment, the change in velocity from whether you're running or standing still is trivial. You're more or less always traveling at about the same percentage of C through space, and thus time seems pretty much constant. If you can dramatically change the percentage of C you're traveling (say, by hopping on a starship that can reach 50% C) then you'll notice some distances in the passage of time relative to things that are still moving at your original speed.

There's a lot of weirdness that shakes out of this; and I, an amateur, can't even begin to explain them. Something that has zero motion in space is moving at C through time, and I have no idea what that really means. Light in a vacuum, which travels at C, has zero movement in time; no clue what that means. Motion through spacetime is relative to an observer, which makes all of the previous discussion about spinning planets and galaxies contributing to your motion through spacetime kind of... wacky.

Does all of this seem like bullshit? Absolutely. Can it be experimentally verified? Yes, and has been. One thing I've learned from studying physics: however weird you imagine the Universe to be, your imagination falls short of reality."	2	0

This is very helpful and it never occurred to me to think of it like that.

It compares the temperature of blood passing through it to the usual temperature and if the temperature is too high, hormones are released that will induce sweating, which cools off the skin and the skin then cools off the blood which cools off the rest of the body. When the temperature is too low hormones are released that work to keep the core organs at the right temperature and other things that help warm the body up.	5	0

The hormones activate things when they bind to a receptor. The cool part is that only specific hormones can bind to a certain receptor in the same way a key only unlocks a certain door. When connected, they can change the shape of the receptor, which changes the way it behaves and this is what we feel when we get goosebumps for example.	5	0

These processes are similar to the chemical reaction of fire - oxygen reacting with the chemicals in our bodies to produce energy. This energy is partially lost as heat, and partially utilized to power things like our muscles and brain. When used in our brain, it eventually becomes heat through the chemistry that powers our nervous system. A lot of the energy used in our muscles also becomes heat through friction in our bodies. All of this heat keeps our bodies nice and toasty. To keep at the right temperature, we can either make more/less heat, or dispose of our existing heat faster/slower. The latter has to do with blood flow, breathing, etc. By bringing blood vessels closer to our skin, or increasing blood flow to extremities, we can dissipate heat faster. Conversely, reducing blood flow to our extremities and bringing our blood vessels in can retain that heat. Alternatively, movement can increase the amount of heat we generate. That's why we shiver.	2	0

The serpentine belt is what makes all of your Under hood accessories work (power steering, alternator, etc) and it is turned by the engine. When the AC compressor engages (when you turn the AC on) it produces more resistance on the belt, which causes the engine to work harder to power everything.  So the engine needs to make more power to achieve the same end result.  More power=more fuel used.	16	0

The way it sticks to things is something like the static electricity effect you get when you rub an inflated rubber balloon on cloth, and stick it to the wall.

The reason is that water is V shaped - one Oxygen atom has two Hydrogen atoms stuck to it at an angle. The Oxygen is at the point of the V, and has a negative charge. The Hydrogens are at the top of the V with a positive charge. Positive likes to stick to negative, and so anything else, anywhere, that has a positive *or* a negative is going to get water stuck to it if that water touches it. Cloth is usually an organic molecule made of a chain of stuck together carbon atoms, and usually has oxygen atoms and hydrogen atoms sticking out itself, not as sticky as water, but sticky *to* water, so if water molecules brush up against the cloth, they stick. They fasten onto their good buddy by what at called 'van der Waal forces', much like static electricity.

Water also likes to stick to itself, for the same reason. So, water 'crawls' along cloth - if water touches a corner of cloth, it will spread out all along the cloth, flowing, sticking, pulling more water after it, even uphill. 

One touch and your cloth is wet, and won't get unwet until the water gets turned to vapour and floats away. It's all clinging to charges in the molecules of your clothes, and to itself, and doesn't like to let go."	7	0

Water can’t really stick to a tile floor that well, it’s just a relatively flat surface. Your clothes are made up of millions of small fibers and pockets between those fibers that water likes to stick to, a much larger surface area than the ground.

Once water sticks to something, you either need to physically remove it or wait for it to evaporate into the air. You can’t reach all of the places water likes to sit, so you can squeeze it in the hope that those pockets will get smaller pushing water out, spray it with air hoping the air will pick up water molecules faster, or heat it so they’re more likely to jump into the air."	4	0

Like ""I have two hands"" means I am currently in a state of having two hands, and ""I have done the dishes"" means I am currently in a state of having done the dishes. Similarly, ""done"" is a description of the state of the dishes, rather than an action. i.e. The dishes are done. They are done because I did them.

""did"" is a past tense action. Like ""I did walk outside"". The reason you don't say the past tense of the verb (i.e. ""I did walked outside"") is because the word ""did"" is already creating the past tense. If you didn't use the word ""did"", you'd have to use the past tense of the verb instead, for example ""I walked outside"".
Basically ""did walk"" = ""walked"".

""did you done the dishes"" basically uses two past tense words (did and done) which is why it sounds strange. Think like a double negative. Also remember that ""did"" basically applies a past tense to a present tense verb. e.g. ""done"" = ""did do"", ""ran"" = ""did run"" etc.

Your CPU is the main one, this handles most of the math and heavy number crunching and logic that makes programs work. Your second one is your GPU, Graphics Processing Unit, also known as your video card. This is what handles all the graphics on your screen. While CPUs are great at handling large numbers, GPUs are excellent at large quantities of very very small calculations, which allows them to manipulate your screen pixel by pixel and draw out images. Now for GPUs, they can only do so many calculations at one time, and as such they have an upper limit of the memory your computer can handle to draw graphics, this is your video card memory. If you're running a video game on your computer, you're either running it on an insufficient system or running a game with particularly complex graphics, and as such, your GPU is struggling to handle all the calculations necessary at once. The easiest way to fix this is to lower the graphics settings or upgrade your GPU.

Hope this helped!

Instead of doing that, you can just find the verse once, then write it onto a piece of paper. Now, you don't have to search the whole bible to find the quote.

The book is your hard drive. The paper is your memory, the quote is data, and your brain is your GPU (Video chip). If your video memory is almost full, it means that whatever you are doing is filling up the memory more than it can handle. Once that happens, you start having to use the hard drive to get the data.

The details will be decided by a judge, but essentially a portion of every dollar he earns from here will go towards creditors and fines until it's paid off or (more likely) he dies. That portion is set high enough that it matters but not so high that he has no incentive to work or can't support a basic standard of living with his earnings.	1	0

This is a process where you are forced to pay back as much of the debt as you can and then the rest is deleted. However there are a number of restrictions you have to live by for the next ten years. But there are a number of different debts that is except from the bankruptcy process, this includes student loans and court judgements. So I would guess that McFarland does not have the option to declare bankruptcy. So the only way to get rid of the debt is to pay it or wait to die. He will still be able to live a relatively normal life. However he will be in constant risk that the creditors will get a court order to seize his property or garnish his wages. There is a limit to how much they can take as he needs some money to live and this is set by a judge. But basically he will not be able to build up any savings or spend money on ""luxury"" for the rest of his life.

That being said there are ways around this. For example he might work minimum wage for his sons company. Or his employer might give him more benefits then normal rather then a proper wage. However he might not be able to get away with it as the judge might see it as illegal wages and demand the money garnished from his pay anyway. It is also possible that he might negotiate with the creditors for a better arrangement. The argument being that the more motivation he have for making money the more they will be able to get from him. But in any case he will be a debt slave for the rest of his life."	2	0

Ideally you would have put stabilizer in it before leaving it sitting, but even just running it a bit is probably better than nothing.  When you do get back to it you'll want to fill it up with fresh fuel.  If it sputters/stalls get the fuel filter checked, but it'll probably still be fine at less than a year and periodically getting run a little bit.	2	0

Or rather, St helens behaves like many volcanos: The hole at the top gets blocked. Gasses dissociating from magma result in a buildup of pressure. Eventually, that pressure is sufficient to shatter the blockage and erupt out the top. In Helens' case, it got stuck in a tube to the side of the cone instead of at the top of it, and the explosion blew the side of the mountain off instead of the top of it. [Here](https://youtu.be/AYla6q3is6w)'s a video that shows the lop-sided nature of the magma build-up. Then, a large earthquake caused the side of the mountain to collapse, releasing all of the trapped gas all at once instead of gradually over time: as if you were to shake up a can of coke and then cut the top off with a sword, instead of just popping the cap.	3	0

The trouble with volcanoes is that even small changes can dramatically alter how they behave. You know how when you drop certain kinds of mints into pop it causes an eruption? That's because the gas within the water normally stays in suspension, but forms gas bubbles around irregularities, such as those on the surface of the mint. Any man-made change to a volcano would more likely just cause even more gas to be released, rather than anything else. Ie, interfere with a volcano and chances are you just cause it to erupt.	3	0

Fruits are defined/categorized by the way that their seeds, skin, and flesh are arranged relative to one another. Berries are a specific type of fruit that has a thin skin, thick flesh, and seeds in the center. Think blueberry.  Blackberries are also aggregate fruits. I believe pineapples also are, because their seeds are on the outside as well. Bananas and cucumbers are both technically berries, if that helps.	3	0

Most people are familiar with a culinary definition which mostly uses taste and look for the definitions in which case strawberries are certainly considered a berry. However when people state that strawberries are not a berry they are most likely quoting one of several different biological definitions. These definitions are more concerned with the lineage and function of a specific trait. So for example a strawberry have the seeds on the outside of the fleshy fruit while most other things that might be classified as berries have the seeds on the inside. Note that there are different biological definitions as well and some even do not define berries at all as the term is very ambiguous. Lots of different unrelated parts of plants falls under the culinary definition of berry so most meaningful biological definitions would have little in common with the origin of the term. Even culinary definitions is a bit vague with the term when it comes to for example the banana.	3	0

At this point you and I are just arguing semantics, but a pineapple is not a berry because of the arrangement of the flesh and the seeds. It depends on the number of ovaries that were fused to form the fruit. so a pineapple is an amalgamation of berries, because it started as multiple ovaries that fused. True berries come from a single ovary, leading to that arrangement of flesh and seeds.	1	0

Let's look at an example.  To keep the numbers nice, let's say the grand prize for our lottery is $900,000, each ticket costs $1, and the chance of any ticket winning is one in a million.

On average, if you buy a ticket, it will win $900,000 / 1,000,000, or 90 cents.  But you had to pay $1 to play, so you make (on average) a loss of 10 cents.  And there's nothing you can do to consistently make a profit that way.

But if no one wins, the prize can build up.  So the next week, the jackpot is $1,800,000.  Then when you buy a ticket, you expect to make (on average) $1.80.  Again, the ticket cost $1, so that leaves a net profit of 80 cents.

If you only bought one ticket, that's still a very long shot, so you're probably not going to win.  But if you bought every possible combination, it would be a guaranteed win.  Sure, it would cost you a million dollars, but you would win $1,800,000, for a total profit of $800,000.

In practice, there are a lot of reasons this doesn't happen often.  First, the odds are *way* less than one in a million, which means it costs a lot to buy enough tickets.  Second, it's not common for prizes to build up far enough that it's worthwhile (particularly taking taxes and into account).  And of course, the people hosting lotteries don't want people winning, so it's illegal in many places to buy enough tickets to game the system."	2	0

With a self driving car it is no different, except their instincts are faster and more precise than a human. For urban environments the reaction will mostly be slamming on the brakes, even if they can't fully stop before hitting someone. For highway/freeway environments it will be swerving around them, and if they leave a safe avoidance path at all times (the way drivers are taught to do) the driver of the car would never be at risk.

I agree that there is some time before fully self driving cars should/will be adopted, but after improvements in the autonomous racing scene, and after all street signs are mapped into a database, the argument against self driving cars will become very weak.

We've already seen crashed linked to tesla's ""autopilot"" function - drivers wrongly, but not entirely unreasonably, thinking it could basically drive the car by itself.

If you have to pay attention closely enough to respond in an instant to any danger then you might as well be driving the car yourself. In fact, I'm dubious about how feasible it is for someone to take over the car in a sudden emergency like that.

Vehicles might be rated only to self-drive on motorways, not on other roads, but when they're in autonomous mode they will be fully autonomous. And while the driver's insurer will be responsible in the first instance for any damages due to bad driving, ultimately they will have the possibility to recover those losses from the manufacturer if there are flaws in the car's design."	1	0

Actually, deep-sea fish's eyes burst when they get taken up to the surface (but that can also happen with regular food-fish). Blobfish also don't look like that floppy pile of meat when they're in their natural habitat, they are kept neat and round by the high water pressure. Also: cells are pretty magic so they can withstand huge pressure differences which means the fish will not completely burst when you take it up.	12	0

So it feels kinda like pain from your urethra but it’s not coming from there, that might explain why it feels deeper. Cuz it’s like coming from not as far down and you mind ain’t used to it, or something.	66	0

Think of how your hands and feet are much less sensitive than your back. Your hands and feet touch and interact with a wider variety of things more often and experience more thing that toughen the skin.

It all has to do with what touch receptors are in different body parts. Your brain will determine what it needs to keep noting is there (like pain).

My fingers are also calloused and 'worked' but I can still feel things with sometimes unbelievable sensitivity (it is something that has always amazed me) and also I have started using heavy duty moisturizer as my hands were a bit neglected for a while, it helps way more than I thought it would.. repeated exposure to almost anything will reduce the effects to what your brain thinks is a normal level too	1	0

During the close, they had left a wound drain in to help with the healing process. When the doctor came in to check the drain and remove it a few days later, he pulled it out after jostling it around a bit. It seemed like it took forever for the tube to come out, it was like one of those cartoons where they just keep pulling miles of handkerchiefs out of someone. Realistically it was probably around 6-8 inches, but it was still twice or more the size what I thought was there, it felt super weird. To this day, I have no nerve feeling in that area, I can poke and scratch at the spot and feel nothing.	2	0

It pumps information in and out of your computer. Your bandwidth is like the width of that pipe, how much it can pump at once. Google is built to be easy to load, so when you first pull it up it is sending very little down the pipe, so it all gets to you quickly. Reddit is full of pictures, text, links, and other kind of information that all has to come through that pipe. It takes a little longer to get it all through.


It might also take longer if the information has further to go (it has to go through other pipes to get to you because it started far away)."	2	0

[Google's landing page](https://www.google.com) is much smaller and simpler than [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com). Google, for example, transfers about 65 KB of data to load the page (after caching). Reddit, on the otherhand, transfers anywhere from 600 KB to 1 MB of data (after caching). So on average, you only have to download about 1/10th of the amount of data to get to Google, as you do to get to Reddit.  

Another factor is both use compression, and a quick check showed Google to be about 400 KB in size, and Reddit to be about 1-1.2 MB in size. It takes time to decompress the data, and the more there is the longer it'll take.  

Additionally, your browser then has to display what it received from the servers, this too takes time and, as with the previous two factors, will take longer if there's more to display.  

All of this of course comes after the most straight-forward factor, the connection between you and Google is *most likely* better than between you and Reddit....simply because Google is a much larger company, meaning they're likely going to have better distribution around the globe (faster loading for most people), better hardware, better redundancy, access to faster internet to serve their content, access to more robust server and networking software and hardware, etc. Don't get me wrong, Reddit is professionally hosted too, but they don't own the full hosting configuration and data centers like Google does for their own stuff.  

ELI5 Edition: Loading Reddit is like mowing a 2 acre yard with a good lawn mower - there's a lot of work to get done but you have sufficient equipment that it isn't the slowest process in the world. Loading Google is like mowing a 1 acre yard with a tractor - there's less work to get done and you have *way* more equipment than necessary so it gets done really quick."	4	0

Boys would become apprentices or farmhands around puberty, while girls would often begin working in the home with their mothers even earlier. By the time they were what we consider legal adults, they'd be fully productive members of the community (and probably married).

So these children added to the productive value of the family/community very quickly with minimal investment. Moreover, they provided retirement stability for their parents in an era where there wasn't socialized health care or retirement plans.

In the modern day, children are almost purely a cost. You have to spend enormous amounts of money to raise them to adulthood - at which point this investment goes off and lives its own life without providing any financial resources back to the parents. Neither do they provide appreciable financial benefits in retirement, since that's normally handled by other methods.

The level of risk is also much lower. If you want one productive child to survive until you're old enough to retire, you need to have multiple children given poor medical care and nutrition in the pre-industrial world. In the modern world, if you want a child to attend your funeral, there's a good bet the single child you have will make it that far."	7	0

Cloth diapers were the only option, mothers tended to breastfeed longer, even kids from well-off families had fewer toys than we’re used to now, paid childcare was far less of a necessity, clothing and shoes were made to last and could be handed down, expenses like braces and college funds were rarer, many families kept vegetable patches, it wasn’t unusual for all the children in a family to share a bedroom (with more than one to a bed) so there wasn’t the expectation that a large family needed a large home, etc.  

Sure, every additional mouth to feed and body to clothe still cost money, but the overall financial burden was considerably less due to the customs and norms of past generations."	3	0

There a liver cells, neurons in our brains, etc. Nearly every one of these cells stores the DNA, the plan of how your body looks and functions. 

Since she is wondering how she grew... You could tell her that every human initially starts of with a single cell that has a part of the mother and a part of the father. That this cell duplicates and copies and pastes itself over and over again. 

In case you want to give her existential dread you can also explain that each time the DNA is copied when the cell duplicates a tiny bit is cut off at the ends. As we grow old these telomeres will shrink more and more until important data is lost, important functions stop working and we end up dying as a result."	2	0

When you talk about a menstrual cycle you are talking about the whole 28 ish day process for a female body to prepare for a possible pregnancy. With that out of the way, menstrual blood is not just bleed, its endometrial cells that are being ""shed"" from the uterine walls. This is actually a gradual process as hormone levels drop, and that is one of the reasons it lasts for some days, because the hormone drop is not really that uniform. Evolution could have developed a way to do it in one day quickly if it saw the need to, but if you think about it, that would cause you a great deal of pain as the muscle around your uterus contracts to expell the endometrial cells. So it rather does it slowly and delicately."	6	0

So I either don't use as much blood as I use to or my body is more efficient.

Interestingly enough other than other primates there are only a few other species of mammals that have periods. Most other animals will absorb the blood. Humans have a thicker lining than other animals because our fetuses are greedier than others and burrow deeper into the lining. The extra blood helps the mother ration nutrients so the fetus doesn't take everything. Also humans are more likely to spontaneously miscarry it's estimated that more than 50% of pregnancies end in miscarriage most happen before you would get your first period so you might not even realize that your pregnant except perhaps a heavier flow. The miscarriages are likely caused because the embryo was abnormal some how and the mother's body didn't want to waste resources bring a non-visible offspring to term. So one or both of these reasons could be why humans have periods unlike other mammals. 

If you have seen a dog bleed it is not a period that is a sign of ovulation."	2	0

Evolution doesn’t select for the most convenient thing, it selects for the most advantageous thing and if something is annoying but not harmful, it’s not going to selected against by evolution. The reason it didn’t matter to have a 5 day period for most of human development is that periods used to be quite infrequent. With no birth control and with the greater exercise and less rich diet of Paleolithic times, a woman might menstruate 50 times in her entire life. A heavier period might even have meant a greater chance of pregnancy because it discouraged people from having sex when not fertile, meaning more sex during fertile days of the month and greater odds of pregnancy.	2	0

For example, let's say there's a fork in the sidewalk. If I go left, I will immediately be rewarded with $5. If I go right, I will be immediately lose $10; however, if I continue down the right path another 100 ft, I will be rewarded with an additional $100. This means the Q value for going left is $5, and the Q value for going right is $90. Even though I lose money in the beginning, the Q value is still higher going right because the total reward is $100 minus $10.

This is because those fast boats are limited by how close to the apparent wind they can sail. I’ll assume you know what that is, happy to explain if not.

The key thing is that every boat has some limiting angle to the apparent wind and if it gets any closer to blowing directly from in front then the boat will slow down. For a given boat speed to true windspeed ratio the largest apparent wind angle will occur on a beam reach. You can draw yourself some triangles to demonstrate this: draw the true wind as an arrow pointing down the page, and the boat speed as an arrow pointing towards the tip of the first arrow. The apparent wind will be the third side of the triangle, and the apparent wind angle is between this and the second arrow.

Intuitively you can think of it like this: from any point of sail if you luff the apparent wind must get more on the nose which is not good. If you bear away the apparent wind must get lighter which is not good. Where does the optimum balance between these occur? In the middle on a beam reach."	3	0

If you're going downwind, the energy you get from the wind approaches zero as you reach the speed of the wind. If you're going at a right angle to the wind, you aren't fighting the wind in the direction you want to travel, and you're not removing the difference in velocity between yourself and the wind that allows you to extract energy from it.	4	0

So apparent wind is calculated from the component vectors of true wind and boat velocity, and different sail shapes will be able to sail closer to apparent wind. In some scenarios such as the types of boats you described, pythagorean theorem gives the optimal wind angle for those sail shapes at beam reach. If that's the case then that makes a lot of sense to me now. Thanks for the explanation!	1	0

It is curved by the airflow creating low pressure ahead  of it, higher pressure behind thus driving it forward. Sailing closer to the wind the sail becomes less efficient in producing forward motion up to the point where it stalls. Sailing downwind the maximum speed possible is obviously that of the wind. But across the wind in a well designed dinghy or sailboard, the lift effect means that travelling significantly faster than the wind speed is possible.	3	0

As an example, a ""black"" asphalt road under direct sunlight is sending considerably more light into your eye than a ""white"" object under dim illumination would be. Actually, a vantablack-colored object under bright direct sunlight (reflecting 1/2,000 of at most 100,000 lux illumination = at most 50 lux) is approximately as bright as a white object under indoor lighting at night (reflecting most of ~50 lux illumination). But the asphalt still looks black because it's much dimmer than surrounding concrete, trees, metal, etc, while the dimly-lit white object looks brighter than surrounding objects. (This is why the Moon appears bright white in the night sky, despite the lunar regolith [actually being a rather dark grey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_soil#/media/File:Lunar_Regolith_70050_from_Apollo_17_in_National_Museum_of_Natural_History.jpg).

Because it increases grip and safety on almost all surfaces even if it's ""counter intuitive"" because it's not the theoretical maximum surface area.

A treadless tyre on any kind of dust, debris, water or even a stone isn't able to mould around the obstruction and you lose a large portion of your grip.  A treaded tyre is specifically designed to squeeze that stuff away and provide grip.  Even a tiny, thin layer of water renders a treadless tyre useless, it basically acts as a lubricant.  But if you have a tread, the water is pushed into the tread, allowing the rubber to contact the road directly.

What do we call shoes without any grip on the sole?  In the UK we call them slippers.  Because they slip on surfaces like hell.

You're literally an idiot to drive a vehicle with treadless tires on anything that isn't a racetrack (which has hazards of its own).

Rally cars - all have treaded tyres.

Road cars - all have treaded tyres.

Industrial machinery - all have treaded tyres.

The only exception is things like Formula 1 which they don't tend to race in the complete wet, and even then they replace with wet tyres which have treads and are designed to evacuate water (and other fine debris, which acts like water) from under the tyres.

A treadless tyre is literally illegal in almost all countries on a public road, for a reason.

""The legal minimum tread depth for car tyres in the UK is 1.6 millimeters, across the central 75% of the width around the complete circumference of the tyre.""

And the penalties are harsh:

""Motorists risk a £2,500 fine and three penalty points if they drive with a worn tyre. If all four tyres on the car are worn below the legal limit, you could potentially lose your licence and face a £10,000 fine.""

And the first part is PER TYRE.  So if you have two worn tyres, that's £5000 and 6 points on your licence (max 12 before you are banned from driving)

In fact, trying this on most modern tyres will often reveal a very-obvious white layer under the tyre that police can see from a long way off that your tires are no longer legal and they will nick you for immediately if they see that white showing through.  Sanding down a commercial tyre is literal stupidity, and nothing like a professionally-designed hugely-expensive slick tyre on a maintained racing track.

Why do you wear wellington boots, work boots, etc. with treads in the rain or when carrying things and not suit shoes with flat bottom?  Because you slip and fall on your arse because you lose grip in the wet or on surfaces with sand, gravel, debris, etc. almost immediately.

Why are your feet not flat and smooth and the full surface area, but have ""fingerprint"" like surface and only a few points of contact?  Because it provides better all-round grip in all conditions, and you don't have to then change your feet/tyres every time you want to go through a puddle safely.

This is a prime post for my mother's ""If your friends stuck their head in a gas oven, would you do it too?""  Don't do this.  These people are idiots."	3	0

But on the other hand, the city I live in has a farmer's market stall where you can trade (I think) $20 of SNAP for $25 of Farmer's Market Money (might have the rate wrong - but you get more Farmers Market Money than SNAP money); which any seller at the farmer's market can trade back to the city for real money."	1	0

For reference, the electricity in your walls runs at about 60 hertz and 120 volts.

As such, they produce a bit of an electromagnetic field around them (all electric devices do this, but most are way weaker). When you bring other devices near the field, the electronics inside have a current *induced* in them, which means that just being near a highly energized thing makes the original object feel the energy too. 

Your alarm clock and keyboard thought you were pushing buttons because it could feel the electricity in its circuits and thought ""huh. guess the user is trying to do something.""

A historical artefact that has been well-preserved in a dry atmosphere might fall apart quickly if suddenly exposed to air with more damp and moisture.

Also, many artefacts are well-preserved because they have been insulated against any contact with air at all - for example, in lava or river mud. When excavated and suddenly exposed to air, there can be chemical reactions that cause the object to fall apart. If the object could be kept in a vacuum, there wouldn't be any contact with air to cause these reactions.

Light also has a bleaching effect on many things, including modern textiles. If you have a table cloth on your table in front of a window, for example, then over time the colour of the cloth will start to fade as a result of spending so much time in the light. Therefore, historical objects may lose their colour or lustre after spending decades or centuries exposed to too much light."	3	0

Over time artefacts that are carbon based (human remains, books [paper and leather], fabrics from natural fibres [cotton, silk etc.]) ie. things that at one time or another were a living organism will start to decompose and degrade. This is a natural process. Factors such as temperature, UV exposure, pressure, and humidity can either expedite or slow down this process so when items are kept in controlled conditions it’s more about controlling those factors as opposed to the component parts of the air. 

Artefacts that are not carbon based like rocks and stone don’t have this issue. Sure they may break or constant use and handling may wear them down (think of how stone steps in really old building start to dip were people are walking causing it to wear away over time. But if you find a rock at an archeological dig you can just set it on your shelf and it will be fine.

You can almost think of it as the steepness of an incline. 

Example:
Imagine two platforms A and B that are a fixed (arbitrary for this analogy) distance from eachother, that are connected by a bridge (or tube, pipe, whatever is best for your imagination)

If platform A is 50m tall and platform B is also 50m tall, there is 0 difference in their height, and therefore 0 difference in potential. A ball placed on platform A will not roll to platform B. This is analogous to 0 voltage (where there is 0 difference in charge).

If platform A is 100m tall, and B is still 50m, there is now a change in the potential between the two platforms, so a ball will roll from A to B.

If platform A is raised to 200m, and B is kept at 50m, now there is an even greater difference in potential, and a ball placed at A will roll and reach B with even greater energy.

This analogy becomes a little complicated when trying to incorporate resistance, force and power bc the incline and friction matter, but I wanted to keep things simple for the sake of defining voltage.

You can think of each rolling ball as a charge, and it's movement as energy. Voltage, as you probs know, is energy per unit charge. So in the analogy, it's the kinetic (or lack of) energy of each rolling ball.

Another thing, in this example, the two platforms are acting much like two terminals of a battery (+ / -). The amount of balls rolling would be the current. The friction and air resistance met by the balls on their way is the resistance.

(Disclaimer: again, there are some areas of this analogy that become kind of murky due to kinetic physics not perfectly translating to electric forces, but I think the above serves as an okay visual)"	3	0

Yes. If you increase the voltage on a given circuit, you will also increase the current. That's why a lot of American appliances (120V) will get fried if you plug them into a European grid (230V). To get the same current at a higher voltage, you have to increase the resistance of the circuit.

At an electron level, imagine two parallel metal plates, connected to a source of DC power (like a battery). You now have a plate capacitor with a homogeneous electric field between the plates. If you bring a charged object (like a single electron) into that field, it will be drawn to one side with a certain force. To completely move it to the other side, you will have to expend a certain amount of work (W), depending on the charge of your object (Q). The ratio W/Q is the voltage U, measured in the unit Volt (1 Volt = 1 Joule/Coulomb)."	2	0

This is described by Ohm’s law: V = IR (I stands for current). Arrange it around a bit and you get I = V / R. So if you double the voltage you’ll get a doubling of the current too. But if you increase the resistance, than you decrease the current.

Power (watts) is voltage times current. So we can figure out that an 100 watt incandescent light bulb on a 120V circuit is drawing 100/120 amps or just under one amp. And it’s resistance (which is a fixed property of the bulb) is R = V/I = 120/(100/120) = 120^2 / 100 = 144 ohms. Now this bulb was designed to output 100 watts at 120 V, which means the resistance of the filament was engineered to be 144 ohms. Now if you took this bulb and tried to use it on a 240V circuit, it would draw twice as much current, and output 4 times as much power (light+heat) (twice the voltage times twice the current = 4 times the power). In reality it would probably instantly burn out.

Now an 100 watt bulb designed for a 240V circuit needs to pass only half as much current AT 240 VOLTS as the other bulb does on the 120V circuit. (Because power = VI, and we’ve doubled V). And according to ohms law, to pass half the current at twice the voltage, it’s resistance must be FOUrR TIMES that of the 120v bulb, or 576 ohms. Now what about if we take our 240V bulb with its higher resistance (remember it was deliberately designed to have a higher resistance) and plug it in on a 120V circuit. Then, since the voltage dropped by half, the current drops by half too. I = V/R = 120/576 = 0.21 amps. And it’s power is P = VI = 25 watts. So it will give off only 1/4 of the light+heat on the 120v circuit as it would on the 240v circuit it was designed for."	1	0

The Ampere (A) tells you the amount of electrons moving across the wire per unit of time, The Voltage (V) tells you how much energy each single electron is carrying. So in your example, the same amount of electrons are crossing the wire while the amount of energy that each electron is carrying varies between the two. This means that the higher V current will be able to get more work done.	1	0

It is away measured between two points.  Let measure it between two plates in a vacuum. You can use it to accelerate electrons, this is how old CRT displays works. The energy of the elections when it reaches the other plate will depend on the voltage difference.

Increase the voltage and keep the distance the same the faster the election will move.

If you lift an object 10 meters upon earth you change its gravitational potential. the energy is proportional to the force of gravity and the elevation difference.

Compare to living the same object 10m on the moon, the gravity on the moon is 1/6 of earth gravity so the energy in the object is 1/6 of what it would have on earth.

So the earth has higher gravitational potential energy for a 10-meter elevation change compared to the moon.  The speed of the object you drop will reach a higher speed on earth than on the moon.

The result is voltage difference creates a force depending on the charged particles just like gravity produces a force depending on the mass.  A change in voltage is like a change in the strength of gravity.


&gt;So basically as I understand, amperage is just how many electrons pass a given point per second. So if you increase the ""force"" (aka voltage) that would force more electrons to move past a given point, essentially increasing the speed, but that should theoretically increase amperage.

This is correct if the resistance of the circuit is constant. Ohms law is Voltage= current* resistance =&gt; current =Voltage/resistance so if the voltage increase and the resistance is the same the current increase


&gt;So I can't understand how you can have 480V at 10A vs 208V at 10A. Not from a mathematical standpoint at all, but from an actual physical standpoint.

The answer is that the device you connect to has a different resistance. 480/208=2.3 so you need 2.3x higher resistance for the same current. 

If you connect a simple resistive device designed for 208 V to 480V the current is 2.3x higher.  Power= voltage * current so 2.3x the voltage and 2.3x the current result in power =2.3*2.3= 5.29 x the power.  So a simple device like an electric heat will output 5.29x the power and will likely overheat and fail.  This is what happens if you use a lamp designed for 230V in 120V it will overheat and die.

There is more complex devices that can handle different voltage like phone charges. Because of how they convert voltage the input current will be lower at a higher voltage



You can compare it to if you have water pipes at different pressure, you can control flowrate but having a nozzle with different aperture size, the smaller the aperture the lower the flow rate is.

If your goal is to full at 10-liter bucket every minute you need a smaller aperture for the water with higher pressure compared to the lower pressure.

The smaller aperture will be resistant to the flow of water.  This is what is done with electronics.   You regulate election flow but have more resistance. A thicker wire has less resistance than a thin wire, The longer the wire the more resistance.   


Incandescent lamps regulate the current and therefore power with the wire resistance. The resistance depends on the wire material, length, and thickness. A 100W lamp for 120v will not be the same as a 100W lamp for 240 V.  A 50W lamp will have a different wire then a 100W lamp design for the same voltage.

Power= voltage * current and combine that with current =Voltage/resistance  we get power= voltage ^2 * resistance. So with 2x the voltage, you need to have 4x the resistance for the same power."	1	0

Look at a single phase version of this.  You have a 120V line and a 277V line, if you put a load on the 120V line to get 10A that load will be 12 ohms.  If you put that 12 ohm load on the 277V line you'll get 23A, a bit more than double the current. In your scenario though the 277V line is providing 10A so it must be fighting a 27.7 ohm load.  The extra pressure of the 277V line would mean more current through a given point(same resistance), the only way to get the same current is to have more resistance to use up the extra pressure

If you want the water example consider two examples.  An above ground pool in the yard with a 1 inch hole in the side shooting out 10 gallons per minute, and an ultra pressurized tank with a pinhole in the side also shooting out 10 gallons per minute.  The flow rate is the same and the pressure is different, why?  Because the resistance(hole size) is also different to even things out.

The only way that you can have two with the same current of 10A and differing voltages of 480V and 208V is if the resistances of the circuits are different. Resistance is exactly what it sounds like, a resistance to the push caused by the voltage. So, even though in the 480V circuit the ""push"" is higher, the resistance to the push is higher, causing the current to stay the same. 

The longer answer departs a bit from ELI5 since it has to do with the interactions between the particles themselves, but I'll try to keep it as simple as possible. If you don't feel like reading my ~~poorly explained physics rant~~ explanation, feel free watch this series of Khan Academy lectures ([https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/electric-charge-electric-force-and-voltage](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/electric-charge-electric-force-and-voltage)) which explains it far more clearly. 

In physics, there is a law called Coulomb's Law that describes the electrostatic force that occurs between two electrically charged particles. All you really need to know (short from stating the equation here) is that the size of the force (the *magnitude* in physics parlance) is proportional to the electrical charges of the two particles and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the two particles. All this means is that if the charge of one of the particles were to double, for example, then the force would double as well. If the distance between the particles double, then the force gets scaled down by 1/4. (Note here that the direction of the force is determined by the signs of the charges, meaning that like charges, + and + or - and -, will experience a repellant force and unlike charges, + and -, will experience an attractive force). 

Now that we've talked about force, we can talk about Electrical Potential Energy and Electrical Potential. And no, they're not the same thing. Confusing, right? To actually understand what voltage is, we need to talk about what Energy and Potential Energy actually are. In physics, Work (W) is defined as the product of Force (F) and displacement (d), and you can think about this as ""Well if I apply some force F to push a box some distance d, then the work I just did on the box (according to physics) is F \* d."" In physics, Work and Energy are defined as equivalent, meaning that the Energy associated with that interaction between you and the box is the same as the amount of work 

When we talk about Potential Energy in physics, we mean there is a certain energy associated with a certain position in space. To understand this, let's consider two particles, A and B, which have opposite charges. To pull charge B away from particle A, we would need to exert a force on it. The farther we pull B away, the greater force we would have to apply more force to bring it farther away. And all the while, if we were to release particle B, it would fly back and stick together with charge A, which is what makes this energy ""Potential"" -- the energy doesn't get realized until we release particle B. 

Calculating the work needed to move charge B some distance R from charge A is not as simple as multiplying the Force by R simply because the force changes as the particle moves farther away, as shown earlier by Coulomb's Law. But rest assured, using calculus, there is a way to calculate the Electrical Potential Energy of particle B at *any* position R relative to particle A, which (by convention) I'll call U. 

The problem here is that U is entirely dependent on the charge of B. Remember from Coulomb's law that if the charge of B doubles, then the attractive force between B and A doubles, meaning it takes double the work to move B to a certain distance away from A. What we really want is some measure of the ""potential to whizz back to A"" that is independent from the charge of B, and instead entirely depends on the distance from A. To solve this, we can create a new unit called Electrical Potential, which we get just by dividing the electrical potential energy by the charge of B. This will get us a measurement of the potential energy just dependent on the position relative to charge A. 

When we take the difference in Electrical Potential between two points, this is the true definition of Voltage. The reason you can consider this as a ""push"" to the electrons in the circuit is because a higher voltage indicates a higher electrical potential difference, which indicates a higher potential energy given to the electrons, which (literally) indicates a higher force on the electrons.

A good analogy to think about this is with gravity -- we can think of gravity as exerting a constant force per mass on every single object near the earth's surface. If you move an object under the influence of gravity higher than another object, we say that the higher object has more ""potential energy"" because it has the potential to have more kinetic energy (which just means it moves faster) once it reaches the ground after being released. In the same way, electrons have more potential energy if they are farther away from a positive charge and closer to a negative charge because they have greater ""desire"" to get to a position of equilibrium."	1	0

Current is the number of gallons per second, voltage is the height that they're falling. A gallon of water that falls 100 feet will gain more kinetic energy than a gallon of water that falls 10 feet. If you were capturing that energy (say, by letting the water flow down a series of water wheels) you'd get ten times as much output, even if the water is moving the same speed, because it's moving that speed across a longer distance.

The key here is that Current = Voltage / Resistance. If you put 200V and 100V across a 10 ohm resistor, you would get 20 A in one case and 10 A in the other. So having 208V, 10A vs 480, 10A means that you're applying the voltages to a different load. If you applied them to the same load, you'd more clearly see that the higher voltage is pushing more current, and thus doing more work. Power = Voltage \* Current, or P = V\^2 + I.

It's most comparable to a difference in height. If you drop the same weight from a higher distance, it hits the ground harder. If you drop a heaver weight (more current) from the same height, it also hits the ground harder.

This is also how electrons give off light, the electrons vibrate and get bumped to a higher energy level, and then release a photon when they drop down in energy again. This is also how you get an emission line or an absorption line that you can use to determine what a star is made of. Different elements have different absorption lines as there are only a defined number of energy levels that an electron can jump, and so it only absorbs some photons with a very distinct energy/frequency.

Idk if your initial question was answered, but the voltage is just how hard the electrons want to move from one place to another and as has been mentioned b4 in this thread, can be liked to water pressure. A high-pressure jet has a very high water pressure (can be 100+ bars) but the actual water flow is quite small as you only allow a very small exit.

Lets say you were making clothes, and you only had to make these clothes fit for one type of person. Then lets say youd instead have to make that same shirt fit someone who uses Small, someone with Medium and someone with Large, youd need to add different materials and everything to make sure that shirt would fit lots of different people. Its the same when coding for PC, the game has to work on lots of different hardware.

When it comes to older games being ported to PC (like 360 games) the problem lies with the Xbox 360 being a different architecture. Most modern PCs (aswell as consoles) run on an architecture known as «x86», however older consoles like the 360 runs on something called «PowerPC». The reason it is difficult to port these games is that not only must the PC work with code that was not intended for it (its working with console code) it also does not understand the language of the code, so it needs to use a translator to translate the code in real time and to then execute it, which is a huge drag on system resources."	22	0

The point of a cache is to be very very fast. If it were larger, you might need to deal with searching through it and addressing it differently which would cost time. The size has been standard for so long that algorithms are extremely optimized to use that size. Changing over would mean starting over with optimization (we may eventually need to do this, but we don't yet as far as I'm aware) so it isn't really necicary. 

Now improvements in reading and writing to a long term storage like disc still has a lot of space and time optimization to be done. SSD made a lot of improvements there, but its not perfect yet. 

Dollar for dollar, its better for computer manufacturers to optimize that end of the problem because there is still a lot to be gained there over trying to fix something that's already very good and would be very expensive to improve."	3	0

If you look at [https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/amd/microarchitectures/zen\_3](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/amd/microarchitectures/zen_3) you get 4-5 cycles delay to the L1 data cache versus 12+ cycles for the L2 cache. The L3 chace has on avrage 46 cycles.

So the very small L1  is not because you have a limited wafer area, it is about the requirement to have a chance with low latency. There is a tradeoff between latency and cache size. This is why you have multi-level cache in CPUs, if you use all the areas for L1 cache it will be larger but slower and the net result is reduced performance.

If you compare Zen3 versus Phenom II as OP did in the post the reality is that the cache size has increased a lot. Both have the same 64kb+64kb L1 cache and 512Kb L2 cache per core.   But the L3 shared among all core on the  CPU/CCX has increased from 6MB to 32 MB. 

The latest desktop variant of Zen 3 the Ryzen 7 5800X3D has 96MB L3 cache per CCX.

So there is an available area to use for the cache but you put it in the L3 cache to keep the latency of the L1 and L2 low."	1	0

Power just describes how fast energy is beeing used - the rate of energy usage.
Unit of power is 1W that is the same as 1 joule per second (J/s).
Unit of energy is W*s, same as 1 Joule.
In electricity consumption we use Wh because of convince, so that numbers are smaller.
1 Watt-hour = 3600 Watt-seconds = 3600 Joules.
Because there's 3600 seconds in a hour.

If you have a device that uses constantly 100W of power, then after one hour it will consume 100Wh, after 2 hours 200Wh, after 24h - 100W*24h = 2400Wh.

Regarding power supplies - that is the maximum power they can draw from wall socket and pass on to whatever device it supplies. Connected device will use the amount of power it needs, no more. If device at this moment needs just 100W, it will use just 100W through power supply, regardless of rated maximum power. But if device will need 800W at some moment, that will exceed what power supply can deliver and it will shut off it's output to protect itself."	3	0

But usually, you select your power supply with some error margin, so say your downstream user of the PSU only consumes 350W.

Also, a higher adrenaline level can help you ignore more serious or more painful injuries, but it depends on how much adrenaline you have pumping and how bad the injury is.

Gunshot wounds are pretty bad, even if they're not fatal, because there's so much energy involved that the bullet does more than just make a hole. It damages the surrounding tissue as well, which triggers more pain receptors. A stab or cut wound, on the other hand, is generally limited to where the knife blade directly reaches.

Only much later did people moved to more high level languages like C, Ada, Fortran etc. Their compilers in term were written in assembly (which is a more human readable form of the individual instruction patterns).

Study the binary language of your target computer, write your logic on paper with a pencil, then convert your logic to machine instructions (still on paper), then take some punchcards and convert the machine instructions into their binary form on the punchcards (make sure you don't shuffle them!). Then go to the computer, put in your punchcards to load the program into memory, set the starting variables using switches, and then the computer will run your program and output the answer with some lights or printing on paper.

It's a bit harder to do from scratch nowadays, good luck trying to orient the ferro-magnetic molecules on a hard drive or to set the bits in a chip of flash memory. But luckily, we don't have to do it from scratch, as modern technology has been built on layers upon layers of previous technology. So now we have things like high level programming languages, operating systems, integrated development environments (IDE) and frameworks, which allow us to get straight to the point with business logic instead of having to figure out how to make the computer do 1 + 1 = 2."	1	1

In practice, different tools have been created for different languages. Often times if you are starting a program, some initial code will be auto filled, as it will be some required repetitive code that every program of that language must use. Some examples of different code editors/IDEs are:

* Visual Studio
* Visual Studio Code
* Brackets
* Pycharm
* Atom
* Sublime Text
* Notepad++
* VIM

All of these tools will have different features, and are often very customizable. Most editors have what is called Intellisense or something similar, that will bring up suggestions of standard code snippets, [as you start to type words](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/editor/intellisense/intellisense.gif). So it is no longer necessary to memorize every last detail of a coding language, like it was long ago. Code editor also help organize the code with proper lines, indentation, and color coding, to make it easier to read and write.

I think your first question doesn't really get to the full extent of what you're asking, which is an even cooler question.

Computers are basically a tiny complex maze where instead of a single corridor, you have many many corridors. And each corridor interacts with another in such a way that the maze actually calculates operations like addition and multiplication. With just a few basic mathematical or logical operations a computer can perform many kinds of complex operations. It just depends on how many corridors, and how fast it can run each operation.

The number of corridors is the bit depth, and the rate of operation is the clock speed of the processor. So a 64-bit 2.4 GHz processor has 64 corridors and runs 2.4 *billion* calculations each second. The actual operation of a processor is much more complicated than this, but that's generally how it works.

All of that is called the architecture of a computer. In order to run programs on that architecture, we need machine code. Machine code is basically the binary sets of values that we enter into those corridors of the maze, and the order in which we do it.

Any programming language has to be translated into machine code before it can actually run. People have developed *compilers* which translate the code that people write in a programming language into machine code, which is all in 1's and 0's and entered into those corridors of the processor.

When someone develops a programming language, the essentially make a syntax and semantics, like a language that we speak, that can be translated into machine code. They do this in ways that can make more sense in the way that people think, so that people who don't know how machines read code can write programs that machines can run.

Today, people have written several levels of programming languages in order to make programming easier to do. Python is a language that was written in another language, C. Python is a lot more readable, and easier to learn than C, while C allows an expert to write more efficient programs."	2	0

After you write the file, you have to run it through special programs depending on the language you're using. They can be interpreters (for languages like Python and JavaScript), compilers (for C/C++, Fortran, etc) or assemblers (for assembly).

It's like making a gear. You make one really shitty gear that can then be used to make a shitty gear, that can be used to make a meh gear, that can be used to make a decent gear, that can be used to make a good gear, that can be used to make a great gear. 

The very first programs are going to be strictly commands specifically to translate into machine code - binary.  ""Activate this transistor"" sort of shit. From there,  you can build a language with code that activates several lines of code from that previous language.

So your display adapter has lines of code that say ""make this pixel this color,  this pixel this color,  this pixel this color,"" etc.  But that kind of thing requires a lot of processing power,  so you make another language that breaks that code down to a bit less intensive and instead of updating each pixel constantly,  it only updates pixels as they change. Since all of that is hard coded now,  you can make a new language they simply runs all of that code with a single line like &gt;updatedisplay

You can then put all of that code into one chipset to run by itself and tell other chipsets when it changes something.   You can also then have different chipsets that do math a little differently because it's easier to do math for one purpose in one way and easier to do math for another purpose in a different way.  For instance, 0 + 1 is not always the most efficient to add 1. This is why you have a video card and a processor instead of two processors ( this is very simplified; modern computing is a lot more difficult than ""1 processor""). Also why some cards are better for editing videos and some are better for gaming

There are other reasons for having multiple chipsets,  such as heat, bus size,  safety measures,  etc. But the evolution came from the necessity of efficiency; use the right chipset for the right job and only make them talk to each other when necessary. All of this is also why standardizing is such a big deal."	3	0

Basically, a computer is full of tiny light switches that can be turned on (1) or off (0). Certain combinations of off and on switches mean certain things to the computer, like ""go look in this spot for what you're looking for"", or they can represent actual data (for example, ""01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111"" spells out ""hello"" in binary). Computers like binary (1's and 0's), that's all they do and all they can understand. However, humans have a pretty hard time reading and writing in binary. Look at how hard it was to read ""hello"" and think about how difficult it would be to read and write complicated instructions, or whole paragraphs of words that you wanted to store, if you were the one writing it out with 1's and 0's. 

That's where programming languages come in. You want to write instructions, but you want to write them closer to English than to binary. For example, you may want to tell the computer to display the word ""hello"" on the screen. There's a big spectrum of languages, with ones that are closer to plain English being called ""high-level"" and ones that are closer to binary being called ""low-level"" or ""assembly"" languages. I'm going to focus on high level languages, since that's probably what you see people use most often. There's lots of different ones, like Python, Java, etc. They all (for the purposes of this ELI5) work pretty much the same way, but they have different rules for how you can write things. For example, in Python you would write 'print(""hello"")' and in Java you would write 'System.out.println(""hello"");'. The only difference is that within each language, everyone agrees to write things in a certain way and use certain keywords to mean certain things. 

To write in a high-level language, you wouldn't write in a Word document because that has a bunch of extra information (like what font you used, and what size your text is) that the computer wouldn't need or understand. But you can just open a plain text editor and type code into an empty .txt file. The trick is, you have to stick with only one language and use all the right syntax and conventions of that language, like putting a semicolon after each line or using tabs to properly align things. This will be important for the next step. You can also use code editors to do this, but they really are just software that gives you hints, like reminds you that you forgot a semicolon. You can copy and paste the text right out of the fancy editor and into a .txt file and it will run exactly the same, so the important thing is just the words you wrote. 

Now, you take the .txt file and name it something like .c or .py so that the computer knows what language you wrote it in. Then, when you try to run your program, a chain of events will occur to translate your high-level code that follows a certain languages rules and looks kind of like English, into straight up 1's and 0's that turn the computers light switches on and off. Something called a compiler will take the high level code and replace each instruction with more basic instructions, called low-level code. So, if you write ""y = 2 * 5 + 4"", it might turn that into ""x = 2 * 5"", ""z = x + 4"", ""y = z"". Then, it will get further replaced by instructions that tell the computer something like ""before, we stored the value of y at lightswitch spot 1234"" so now instead of ""y"" the instruction will read ""1234"". This is assembly language. Everything gets turned into a lightswitch spot and whether the lightswitch at that spot should get turned on or off. The compiler that does this is just another program, but it's not one that programmers write. It was already written and we generally trust it to function properly. Now you have everything in binary, just a bunch of 1's and 0's, and the computer turns its light switches on and off according to those instructions. Those light switches being turned on and off is what makes everything on your computer happen, and if you've written everything right, all the correct light switches will be turned on and off and your computer will do whatever your program told it to do. 

This is a kind of simplistic view, but that's really what's happening. John/Hank Green also have a good video series explaining the levels of abstraction, which I think is what you're trying to get at. It's a really complicated concept and hard to wrap your brain around at first, so don't feel bad if it seems confusing."	171	0

The way to do if, while etc is by using “conditional jumps”, or “branches”, which are instructions that effectively say “if A is larger than zero, skip ahead (or jump back) to this position in the program”. In assembly you tend to have a very limited set of “variables” called registers, which are directly hooked up to the processor. Most op codes can only read and write to pre-determined registers (but you are usually free to add “move” commands to move values between them). Most processors have certain registers that have specific functions that are hard-wired into the system. Like “SP” being the register that determines the memory stack, or “PC” that holds the current “cursor (program counter) of the execution. By changing this register you are effectively jumping around through your code (this is the register that jumps/branches influence).

This is a super simplified model of a generic simple processor, PC CPUs are way more complex but work with the same principles.

One more important instruction is the load/read  and write instructions, those are of the style “write contents of register A to memory address located in B”. (Effectively c-style pointers)

In the end you are just moving data around between registers, writing or reading to memory and doing branches. 

Stuff like video cards, keyboards etc are usually just hooked up to (a set of) addresses you can read/write to, similar to RAM memory. On simple chips these addresses are hard-wired - so very easy to use even in direct assembly."	4	0

Yes, it is!

The first computers could only solve really basic math problems, nothing harder than that. What was revolutionary is that they were *programmable*. The computer could read a program - entered by flipping switches or later by reading a punch card - and execute whatever that program said.

That meant that if we could develop more powerful computers, we could get the computer to do more interesting and complex things.

Even modern computer processors actually have very few instructions. They can do basic arithmetic, move memory around, and they can do an if/then. Everything computers can do is built out of those insanely small building blocks through 70+ years of building layers of complexity on top of it."	9	0

You want your program to do something.  To do that thing, it needs input(s) from somewhere, and does something to make an output.  Now that, but for many combinations of inputs and outputs.  OK time to simplify....

I sketch out a flow chart showing where things are coming from, going to, and the operations being done on them.  Now I realize my inputs need to be tested in case the format is wrong or the data is out of bounds.   I'm looking for ways to test the things I want done to see they wind up with valid outputs.

Time to start coding.  I need a way to request the data from the source, or respond while waiting for an input.  More tests.  Data valid?  Test.  Which action to take?  More tests.  Action does this.  Check to see if results valid.  Test.  Pass output to next link in the chain (output, or more actions).  And while you're testing, create exits to deal with invalid data.

Lather, rinse, repeat.   Design it well, and you get a general purpose process that you can feed endlessly and receive valid output for a variety of conditions and inputs.  X + Y = Z    Any valid X and Y will (should) give you a valid Z.  Test!

Like ""add"". This is called ""microcode"".

We wrote out sets of strings of binary, say a dozen lines ""microinstructions"" which when executed by the lowest level hardware in the cpu, the logic gates and flip-flops, caused the ""add"" to happen.

These collections of microinstructions were placed in a piece of ROM by a special hardware tool. The cpu had primitive logic hardware which enabled it to extract selected microinstructions from ROM. The individual bits of the microinstruction were placed, by hardware, as inputs to the individual logic gates, and that caused the intended function to happen for that clock cycle.

All that to execute an ""add"" machine instruction. This happily only needs to be done once, because now you have a working cpu that understands machine code. That's also too painful to use, so you write an ""assembler"" program that translates a regular text word like ""add"" into machine code. That's also too painful to use, so you write another translator that can convert a piece of text like ""if X == 3 then y = 5;"" into the corresponding assembly instructions.

 and if that's still too hard, you can write more layers on top of that."	3	0

There is memory, RAM, where data is stored as sequences numbers.  Each of location in RAM can be referred to by an Address.  

There are locations called Registers to which data can be moved when we want to do something with it.  Registers have simple names that describe their function.  The AddressRegister contains the location in memory (RAM) that the program will manipulate in some way.  Other registers like A or B are temporary locations for values to be manipulated.   

Some combinations of numbers are Instructions that are interpreted by the processor, the Central Processing Unit (CPU).   Built into the Processor are circuits that cause it to take specific actions when it is fed a particular numeric value.  For instance when it is fed  000001010 (_10 in binary_) it might Add whatever value is in RegisterB to whatever value is in in RegisterA.  Another instruction might be interpreted by the processor as Copy the value in RegisterA the location in the AddressRegister.  

A program is usually written in a  high level language like C.  A  compiler is a program that converts these high level instructions, written in symbols the coder understand, into combinations of values the processor is able to interpret.    

When the compiled program is run it is copied into the machine's memory and a register called the ProgramCounter is set to the value of the location of the first instruction of the program.  The processor retrieves the value (an instruction) from the location referenced by the ProgramCounter, performs the action described by its contents.  This might be something like: Retrieve the value at the address referenced by the next position in the compiled code and place it in Register A. Each instruction contains the information that tells the processor how many sequential values in the compiled program is will need to perform its task.

The Program Counter is then set to the next location in the list of values that are the compiled program and the process repeats until the end of the program is reached.  The last value in a program is a value that the Processor interprets as StopWhatYouAreDoing.

The Processor simply goes through the compiled list of values one after another performing the operations it encounters with the values referenced until it finishes."	1	0

At a high level the answer to your question is yes. The vast majority of computer programs (everything from a web page to an app on your phone) start life as a series of text files written by a human.

While it would be possible to do all that in MS Word and just save all the files as plain text with the right names in the right places, that’s not the best tool for the job, so we tend to use different text editors to create and organize those text files.

These tools make it quicker to write the text (or code as we call it), because a lot of the text we write is made up of some common patterns of words and symbols. Typing those same patterns out over and over would be repetitive, so we use tools that auto complete for us.  In addition for some types of programs, there are a lot of files that are almost the same for every program you write, so the tools we use spilt out those files automatically and we just change a couple of lines here and there, rather than have to type the whole thing out every time.

You know how MS Word has tools like spellcheck to highlight when you’ve made a spelling error?  The editors we use have a different set of tools that highlight when we’ve made mistakes, and they use different colors to show different types of code to make it easier for us to recognize.

The tools we use just make writing the text easier, we still end up typing out the vast majority of it though."	2	0

Humans code in a programming language of some kind, but now the computer can't read it.   
  
That's where a compiler or interpreter comes in, which just translates from our human programming language into computer instructions.  
  
So, all you need to make a program is write code anywhere, in notepad if you want, and run the compiler (a program) and tell it where your code files are. The compiler will spit out files that contain the machine instructions that your computer can understand and run.

Getting it “running” might mean loading a web page or “compiling” a program or app. You may use a basic text editor for writing the actual code, or a specialised editor called an “IDE” or Integrated Development Environment (many of these are free and some you pay for). Once you have something running - and this might include a “test” [a separate bit of code] to verify that it is actually “working” - you add the next thing you want your code to do (ie next “feature”) for example, add an input box or display an image or something. You then load the web page or app again to verify that the new feature is indeed working (again, you might write a test for this) and make sure that you haven’t broken anything else. You’ll keep going at this point adding new features until you’re done. 

One important thing to note here is that code is “mutable”, which means - unlike a house or a fully-grown tree, which have fixed structures - you can always change code in any way you want or even remove some of it - it’s a bit like play-doh in this regard. And just like moulding play-doh, there’s a process called “refactoring” whereby you adjust the code to accommodate each new feature (each time ensuring that all your tests still pass, and you haven’t lost any old features or introduced any “bugs”). Anyway, this process of continually changing code - evolving and adapting to new features - is the key to good software engineering. 

An IDE will usually help by providing tools that simplify the above process, for example, automatic refactoring, test suite runners, support for faster iteration, code debugging, etc."	1	0

But not in an editor. 0 and 1 in an editor are not represented by a bit each, they are represented by an 8-bit ASCII code, which is 00110000 for a '0'. So you can't code directly in binary in an editor.

Back when there were some things that could be entered in 0 and 1 you would use DIP-switches. But saying that a computer does only use 0 and 1 is kind of misleading. Yes, all the calculations are done in binary, but they always use packets of bits (e.g. 8-bit bytes or 16-bit words). It's like saying the written english leguage only consists of dots, because every character can be created of dots.

I once designed a 16-bit RISC processor and implemented it on an FPGA. Of course I didn't have a compiler from the start (I wrote an Assember compiler later), so I had to write in machine code dicectly. I used a hex editor and for the most part was thinking in hex (a numeric system where each number can have 16 different values, instead of 2 in binary or 10 in decimal)."	12	0

So - you use some kind of text editor to write ""the code"". There are varying levels of automation that help you with that.. e.g., you could write code using Notepad - but notepad does not know which programming language you're writing in.. it can't tell if you're misspelling keywords and such.. but technically speaking, you can use notepad to write code for any language, and you _could_ write a working program.. However,  it's much easier to use a ""programming editor"" that has some awareness of the language you're coding in. Or even one step better - an IDE (integrated development environment) consists of a dedicated text editor and other tools that make it very easy to test and run your code, often times ""on the fly"", to ensure that you're doing it right.

So, back to the question:  the 1s and 0s.. what do they actually mean? Well the CPU (central processing unit) inside the computer is an electronic device. I.e. it executes ""digital logic"" by way of electricity flowing through its circuitry, based on whether or not ""logic gates"" are open or closed. The ""logic gates"" themselves are collections of electronic components - think transistors and other stuff. There's a lot of engineering involved, but literally, the 1s and 0s conceptually represent instructions to the processor. 

I'm skipping a lot of details (we're scratching the surface of computer &amp; electrical engineering.. people spend years studying the stuff, of course..) But - the instructions that the CPU executes are stored in the program that's running. Instructions themselves are literally strings of ""bits"" (binary digits). I'm going to contrive an example - but information about the instruction sets of different CPU architectures in real life can be found with googling and such..

So - pretend we have a 8-bit CPU.  This means that every instruction is 8 bits long. Maybe the first 2 bits are the operation to do (maybe 00 means ""add 2 numbers"", maybe 01 means ""subtract"" 2 numbers.. and whatever else. With 2 bits for the instruction, we can only have 4 instructions: 00, 01, 10, and 11)

Maybe the next 3 bits represent number A, and the last 3 bits represent number B..

So the instruction: 00010011 would mean ""add 2 numbers: 010 + 011"". 010 is 2 in binary; and 011 is 3. The result of this operation would be binary 101, which is 5.. if you're familiar with binary numbers,  this example is probably easy to grok.. of not, you're probably thinking wtf..? But - just wanted to give an example. 

Also - the example above is waayyy over simplified. What likely needs to happen is: the CPU needs to ""load"" the values 010 and 011 into memory slots within the processor, called registers. Of course,  when I say ""load"", I mean ""do electrical stuff such that the logic gate circuitry inside the CPU flips some switches (transistors) such that one is ""off"", the next is ""on"", and the next of ""off"" - that's 010, a.k.a. 2, in a particular register. Do the same for 011 in another register. Then, after that, do some more electrical stuff to add those 2 numbers together (i.e. logic gates allowing electricity to flow through the circuitry to flip some other switches somewhere else.. they'll end up as 101). Then, do some more electrical stuff, perhaps to ""copy"" that 101 from the CPU registers, out to RAM, so that the program can then reference the 101 value for some purpose..

The walk-through I just gave essentially represents  how assembly language works. I.e., in programming language, your higher-level code might look like ""a = 2 + 3"". That might mean ""add 2 + 3, then let me refer to that value by the name a"". So then elsewhere in your code, you could say ""print a"", and maybe the number 5 shows up on your screen.

Under the hood, the assembly language for that ""a = 2 + 3"" command might be:
 - set rx1 2 #set register 1 to the value 2
 - set rx2 3 #set register 2 to the value 3
 - add rx1 rx2 rx3 #add rx1 + rx2, store in rx3
 - copy rx3 &lt;some memory address&gt;
^^ then there's some table in memory that associates the name ""a"" with whatever memory address contains the value that was copied from rx3.. this example is totally contrived; I haven't coded assembly in years.. but wanted to give you the basics

And the machine code might be as ""simple"" as 00010011. But that one instruction may kick off the sequence of steps described by the assembly language.  

This is why higher-level languages exist. It's much easier to conceptualize ""a = 2 + 3"" than it is to remember how to load register A, then load register B, then add, then copy to RAM, etc. And it's certainly easier to conceptualize than 00010011.. but ultimately,  your coding tools must translate your code into machine language, which is all 1s and 0s

Hopefully this makes sense and isn't too confuzzling"	2	0

For example the hexadecimal value `4b` is equal to the following 8 bit byte `01001011`. As you see it saves a lot of space compared to spelling out all the bits, and there is an easy translation between the two forms.

A thought, a poem to be made into a pattern that is reproducible.

In short, the guy who pays you and your team will say that he (or someone he paid) had a ""thought"" on how to do something, and the very first part of the program is to document this ""thought"" and converting it into bits and pieces of reality, that is, **things** that can be done in logic that can be executed in hardware (the computer, or the machine, or the process)  that  can eventually be made to represent the thought or idea in a way acceptable to the guy who pays you and your team money. 

SOMETIMES the very first part of the ""program"" is a short quick and dirty piece of software that can simulate the response the guy or guys that pay you. But in larger companies, it it almost always a DOCUMENT in some word processing type that in more sophisticated systems this DOCUMENT has links to other DOCUMENTS that are used to test to see if the ""thought"" is based in any sort of reality (sometimes, it is very much NOT based in reality) and is ""valid"".  

Those initial DOCUMENTS are linked with each other so that we have a way to test the software and verify the software - It is not always easy, because maybe the ""thought"" is something many programmers don't understand by themselves.  

Other DOCUMENTS are the list of tools and plans on how to implement the ""thought"" - the software tools, the types of hardware, the look and feel, and all of these DOCUMENTS will be reviewed by the idea guys (and yes, they make even more DOCUMENTS from the reviews) to make sure the ""ideas"" are represented are what are expected.

I'd recommend that even if you are programming your own ideas, that you get in the habit of starting with a document, even if its a crude representation of your thoughts and ideas, it will help you later. For example, it will give you experience in representing someone else's ideas as a document. 

True story: I was once in a meeting with 2 of the best programmers in Silicon Valley, discussing upcoming work - planning on making new documents to kick off a new project. We were finishing, when the  ""guy who pays everybody"" walked in and sat down. He was an ""idea guy"", some of his ideas were very valid and profitable.  Some were not. But he sat there until I ended the meeting when he took his pipe out of the mouth and gestured over the table, to no one in particular, and stated, ""There is one MAJOR problem with your software!""

Without prompting, both the programmers sat back down and opened up their notes. We sat and waited, ""idea guy"" had put his pipe back in his mouth and remained still. So I gently prompted him to share this ""MAJOR problem"" with the team, and he pulled the pipe from his mouth, waved it over the table and said ""Whenever the power is off, your software loses control!""

Many thoughts went through my mind as I considered a reply.  Why don't I like the smell of roses? Can a urinal be redesigned as a standing toilet? Can gravitational lensing focus a beam of particles and photons and destroy  the Earth?  Which night class would give me the best chance to meet girls?

While I pondered for those very long seconds,  neither of those programmers burst out in hysterical laughter. The both behaved like true professionals, dropping their heads down, one, writing precise lines in bundles of 4 and then crossing them out with a diagonal. The other was studiously writing loops over and over until the edge of the page, the starting a new line of loops.   But they were using their documentation skills to forestall the most appropriate response until I came up with a proposal to create a battery backup for all of our desktop and embedded systems to extend the period before the inevitable ""software failure due to power loss"" became a problem. 

However, had this ""idea"" could have been reviewed in a document form BEFORE publicizing it to others, then a lot of tongues would have been spared such severe bites.

  
In short, if you want to create a complete program from scratch, I recommend you first and foremost learn how to DOCUMENT the process first. The document will help you to work with others in the future."	1	0

Well, a program is more or less like that. The entire content of the book is the ""program"", the page number is the ""program counter"", and your read speed is the ""clock"". When the ""program"" asks you to make your choice, it's either waiting for a user input, or it's grabbing data from memory. If the input or data doesn't ""make sense"" it will either keep waiting for a valid input, or it will freeze. Once a valid choice has been made, it will jump to a predetermined program counter (page), and the program continues from there.

The instructions are text, contained in one or many files. Normally the file containing the text is in the same format as that created/edited by Windows Notepad, or a similar program. 

Word processing programs saved text in a different file format so that it can keep track of font, color, paragraph settings, and many things like that which are important to a document that's going to be printed and read by humans, but are not used in computer program source code.

So programs COULD be written with Notepad, though they practically never are. There are many computer programs (Microsoft VS, eclipse, many others) which are designed to help programmers write their programs easily and correctly. The computer instructions must be correct down to the letter and even the case of letters; misspelling things can cause the program to fail, and the many levels of abstraction and reference to instructions outside a particular file make program code intricate and easy to get wrong. So the ""development environment"" programs help the programmer get these things right, help him/her verify that they are right, and often provide ways of testing the code before it is made into a full program released onto other computers."	1	0

Your cashier has jsut created a program from scratch, but they had to know how to translate your order into a kitchen program. 

When programming, your interface is the keyboard, and you type in commands. There's a whole bunch of commands, and different ways to put them together to do useful things. There's a certain way these commands are put together, into what is a called a program.

We use an text editor, like notepad, but more often it has special features that help us organize our programs, like having lots of text files to separate parts of the program when it gets too big.  We call this editor an IDE, for Integrated Development Environment.

There are different languages, or sets of commands, that were made by different peolpe for different urposes. But these languages were made to look like English so that people could use them more easily than having to memorize machine commands.

But the CPU doesn't understand these languages.

We need a translator that knows how to read in these programs and spit out the kitchen commands to whip up a tasty meal. 

This can be a feature of the IDE, or usually it's a separate program called a compiler. The IDE passes the list of files to the compiler and says, here, make me a program that runs on a PC. The compiler looks at the program and generates another file that contains more low-level machine commands.  These commands are usually different depending on what OS it is for (Linux, Mac, Windows) because each OS has a different way of talking to the underlying hardware.

When you run the compiled program (or binary), you're telling the operating system (which is just a another program, but a special one that knows how to communicate with the hardware directly) to read the binary and run the commands directly on the CPU.

These are langauges that don't immediate get compiled to binary and are instead interpreted on the fly."	1	0

Imagine you get an idea for a program that lets you keep track of whether or not your car is locked &amp; if the alarm was set.

Most programmers today use what is called an IDE, which is an acronym for Integrated Development Environment. At their core, IDEs integrate a text editor and a compiler with some bells and whistles to make it easier. The bells and whistles are usually integratioms with debuggers and code navigation features among others. 

However, an IDE is not required. It is possible to edit the text file (the code) and compile it with separate tools while using other tools to provide the bells and whistles. In college, I knew of people that edited code in Notepad. I prefer using a separate text editor and compiler (vi/vim/nvim in my case).

The next step you touched on, recognizing that a computer program is less ""1s and 0s"" than it is just a list of numbers. But what do those numbers do?

In machine code, there are *registers* and *instructions*. A register is basically just a place to store one number; your CPU might have 8 registers. One of those instructions might just looks like this: 

73 19827475939284 4

Where ""73"" basically means ""take the number at this address in memory and write it to that register."" Your computer has a handful of basic instructions like ADD, WRITE, JUMP, and each one has a number identifying it.  73 is one of those. So this line means to go to memory, copy the 19827475939284th number in your RAM, and write it to register 4.

These are all really, really simple things, but if you have millions or billions of lines just like it, on a computer that can do millions or billions of really simple things every second, you can do really powerful things with it.

All the tools to write software just turn lines in code that humans can read -- like ""x = y + z;"" -- into a list of numbers that computers can read."	12	0

If you wanted to get technical you could argue that any program not written in super specific Machine Code isn't from scratch.

Barring that, most programs are written pretty close to square 1. Most programming languages have some basic bones that need to be written as the starting block, and things are built from there. For example: in Java there will almost always be a line with `public static void main(string[] args)` to signify to the program ""hey, this is where you start executing. When you create a new Java file, most code editors have functionality to scribble that out for you to save a little time.

Some situations, like developing for android, have further basic requirements that need to be met. When developing for android, you have to define the layout of the screen, then attach parts of that layout to what's referred to as ""business logic"" or what happens when you click buttons. As a result, the Android Studio code editor provides templates to start with all the basics set up for you. That's not to say it writes your entire program for you, all that code will do is show a blank white screen on the phone.

The closest thing to what you're talking about is called a Framework, for example React, Vue, or Angular. These are not any less coding, just different (and often more complicated) languages for writing/designing the code. 

For the no-code variant you're thinking of services like Wix or WordPress, websites that let you click and drag pre-fabricated pieces around to make your website. However, these only function well for making visual-only websites (like a photo gallery or a blog) and once you start trying to make a functional website you will very quickly need the services of a programmer, and at that point you're better off just having them make the website in the traditional way.

&gt;I've heard about no-code programming

The idea of being able to write code without needing a coder has been every Sales Lead's white whale for as long as coding has been a part of the business sector. However, it's turtles all the way down. In order to create an environment to automatically generate code, you need a coder to write that interpreter and generator, and likely maintain it over time. The deeper fantasy is that one day Artificial Intelligence will reach the point of being able to write and maintain itself, and create software for them without hiring those pesky, expensive programmers. If that does ever happen, it's not on the near horizon in any meaningful way.

The other prevailing issue is competency telling the generator what to do. Some people fare better than others, but over the years I've dealt with many clients who do a poor job of properly articulating what they want the code to actually accomplish. Part of a good programmer's job is to help a client walk through what they actually want to do, and interpret those ideas into a functional code project."	1	0

Imagine you want to make a wedding cake. The only experience you have is seeing wedding cakes and eating them. As you make your plan for your wedding cake, you have to factor in the size of the oven, the pans, the mixing bowls, and purchase ingredients. You are making it from ""scratch,"" which even in baking just means that you're not using a premade mix of the dry ingredients. We could compare that premade box of dry ingredients to the various website builders out there with templates. You just throw in your content to their premade template and have a web page in an hour.  

The oven itself is the code compiler - it's going to apply energy to what you made and push it to its limits. The computer hardware can't read Python just like the guests can't eat cake batter, and the compiler is what puts your program into the 1s and 0s that computers use. The temperature it's set to and the time it's in the oven is the expected user experience, and you have to control both of those so your cake doesn't burn and the bride is pissed. Once the cake is in the oven, there's really nothing else you can do except turn the oven off or remove the pans from the oven.

So the best analogy for the main question is that the programming language is the pans, mixing bowls, measuring cups, etc. Your ingredients are the lines of code you write, and they are contained and assembled in various quantities in your programming language. So yes you can write lines of code in Notepad or Word, just like an amateur could be mixing everything by hand. A professional doesn't want to sit there and just stir for 10 min, so they a big stand mixer with the quantity marks up the side to speed up their work. That would be an IDE that others have mentioned."	1	0

We use very fancy text editors called IDEs (integrated development environments) which include a lot of useful aids for writing programs but you just need a text editor in the end.

Your question is really answered above, but I can't help myself.

You write lines of instructions that follow the rules of the programming language you're using but computers can't however understand programming languages directly. For the computer to run your program you need another program, (depending on your language this could be an interpreter or a compiler) to read what you've written and output instructions the computer understands.

An interpreter reads your code (almost line by line) and translates it into instructions the computer does understand on the fly. A compiler on the other hand reads all of your code and creates a new file that contains instructions the computer understands,the computer can then run this other file directly.

Your next question might be: ""if you need a program to run your program where did that program come from?"". It was compiled by another program, which was compiled by another program, which was compiled by another program, which was written by someone in machine code (instructions a computer can understand).

Writing and executions programs has become quite circular, if tomorrow, every single executable program in the world disappeared it would be a difficult process to put together the simplest instructions that run on a computer to build a program to do a better job of building a program to be able to rebuild compilers and interpreters and recreate every program we use."	1	0

I would add that for the only thing that a computer understands is machine code. 1s and 0s. Every programming language is just a different (human readable) way of making these 1s and 0s. So naturally, whatever language you are using requires a piece of software which will translate code from something a human can understand to something a computer can understand. This is called a compiler or interpreter.	1	0

VBA is actually built right into Microsoft Excel. You can open a blank project and start writing code on an empty screen. Arduino has a download that allows you to interface with the boards and it gives you a blank canvas to work with... Well, it gives you two empty functions because all programs have a setup and a loop, but there's no code in these functions.

The nice thing about these tools is they highlight key words that make it easier to read and find errors. They also have built-in error catchers that will point out mistakes. Arduino doesn't run on your computer so there's no debugger, but VBA does, and you can step through the code one line at a time.

I have a coworker who also writes VBA and will often use a program called visual studio code. It is like notepad, except you have a drop-down menu that has a list of hundreds of programming languages. You pick the one you want and it will highlight key words like the interfaces I mentioned. It won't do any error correction though.

Honestly, if you're asking for advice on what to use, I wouldn't come to me because I'm barely a recreational programmer. I have no efficient pipelines. If you're asking how does coding work, then I'll let you know, you can just start typing anywhere if you know the language, then copy and paste it into the right place later. For instance. This code will list off the first 5 prime numbers in VBA

    Private Sub PrimeList()

       Dim num as integer

       num = 1
   
       For i = 1 to 5

    PCheck:

          num = num + 1

          For j = 2 to num - 1

             If num mod j = 0 then GoTo PCheck

          Next j

          Sheet1.cells(i, 1).value = num

       Next i 

    End Sub

The key isn’t what you write the code in, it’s how you save the file. The extension on the end of the file tells your computer what kind of file it is. Notepad typically saves as “.txt” but if you choose to save it as “.py” it becomes a Python file.

This doesn’t work in some text editors. For instance, Microsoft Word has extra information in the file aside from the text so you can’t simply change its format without converting the file.

Developers have special text editors that highlight different keywords in a program and notify you of some basic issues. Say you have an open parentheses “(“ in your program, the editor will typically warn you of this so you don’t forget to close it with “)”.

It’s unreasonably hard to write functional code in a simple notepad because of all the intricacies of code, but there’s no reason you can’t."	1	0

This is the part that everyone is ignoring, there are specialized programs that are required. Yeah anyone can write code, in a text editor but that doesn't mean that is all you need to program. You will also need a program that can convert the code into machine readable instructions. These are commonly known as compilers or interpreters depending on the language. This is where we will definitely leave the realm of ELI5. But yes you can write code in any text editor, but no that is not all you need to run your code. The ""text editors"" that are commonly used by programmers are actually called Integrated Development Environments (IDE). These are specialized tools to assist in programming, a very popular one is VS Code.

Programming for programmers is a big thing - there's a whole different universe that programmers use to find software that helps them do things faster/easier.  

However, the core of all programming is abstract thinking. It's something you get better at with time. It helps you break down problems into smaller pieces and tells you how to connect them. Before we used computers, we used paper and tools like architects use to draw diagrams to illustrate and debate this architecture before starting coding. Today it's all done online. A good drawing often beats writing a ton of pages of text.  This diagram then allows one programmer to communicate what needs to be done to other programmers. These early models is the language of abstract thinking - and experienced programmers can do a whole lot of that in their head - not needing a computer. But of course, that doesn't help getting the information to other programmers."	1	0

An IDE is a set up where you can write the code, and set up various debugging and other features, so that the whole process goes faster.

If you want to see one, and have MS Excel, enable the Developer option. Then, you can open their IDE to develop macros, which are small programs. There are a bunch of windows in the IDE. In one window, you can write the code, while in another, you can control the execution of it, and in still another, you can see what is happening to your variables as each line of code is executed. This speeds up debugging significantly.

When I started in computing at UofToronto in the 70's, we had to use punchcards, which were fed into a card reader, and then we got a printout. Debugging was slow and painful - a lot of it was inserting ""Print *variable*"" statements so you could see what was happening during the execution. IDE's make the whole process easier. Not simple, just easier."	16	0

These statements can be layered on top of each other to generate more complex conditions such as 'and' 'or' and 'not'.  

&amp;#x200B;

The (simplified idea) is that as long as basic math operations and logical statements can be processed, then any general purpose computation can be done by recombining these building blocks in different ways. You may see this be referred to as being 'turing complete'.

They use a spectrum of tools. At one end are plain text editors such as notepad/ vim which have no coding specific additional helpful features just a place to enter and edit text. At the other end of that continuum are what are called Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) which can have all kinds of very sophisticated features such as debugging, intellisense (which knows the programming languages and finish commands for you) and many more. What a coffee uses is a matter of preference and fit to purpose. Related to this question and important to really understanding the answer is how those things you write get *run.*

Some languages are called markup languages. For example HTML is a markup language. This means means a computer reads the text you wrote pretty much how you wrote it and how a human would read it, just much faster. Other languages like C++ are *compiled w*hich means you run the text you wrote through a compiler program and that program changes it into machine readable code or *binary.* If you opened a compiled file (like an .exe) in notepad it looks like symbolic gibberish bc it's not for humans."	1	0

Whatever is on the if condition which will ultimately be a Boolean (true/false or 0/1), so at the assembly level you compute whatever math is required and that will leave you with a number in some address in memory and then use one of the flavours of the jump instruction. 

For example let’s say you have if (1!=0) then x = 69

The assembly will look something like

LD 1 0xA

LD 0 0xB

JNE 0xA 0xB 0x420

LD 69 0xC

As you can see, even the lowest level language at which humans actually code, it still is not 0s and 1s.

Enter the assembler. The assembler is a glorified dictionary which converts each instruction (LD, JNE, etc)  into a predefined sequence of 0s and 1s (in the case of 64-bit CPU it’s 64 0s and 1s) that is the actual machine code (the hexadecimal numbers are just converted to binary)

The CPU is then hardwired so that at each clock cycle (the Hz of a computer) when the current memory address has a specific sequence of 0s and 1s it does some specific operation and moves to the next memory address."	1	0

Compiling is done for languages like C# or Java, where the code the human writes goes through a translator, and it rewritten into computer language that the computer processor can read. Everything a computer does is pretty just a series of turning a light switch on or off. It is just a ton of them, and done extremely fast. 

Some programs have compilers built in, like Visual Studio, and some don't.

These editors might alter the format slightly to make the code more readable or tweak the instructions for performance or to remove or replace instructions that are known to be weaker, with stronger or more secure instruction sets, depending on how complex the editor software is. But you can code using very simple editor tools, as long as the instructions are all valid when compared against the grammar rules for the programming language. What happens next depends on the language itself. A compiled language needs to have another software take that raw code and transform it into the computer-specific codes that enable the instructions to actually be followed. This is called “compiling”. The compiled code is the transformed copy of the raw code, and only the computer can really read it and follow it effectively. That’s where it becomes “executable” software, or “library” modules that other executable modules can reference. The other type of transformation of raw code is called “interpretation” and happens when the compiler is built into the language executor itself. In this scenario, the raw code is executed in real time, where the compiler and other tools transform it in-memory into executable instructions, without a pre-compilation being required. This is easier for humans because they can change the raw code and re-run more quickly, but harder for the interpreter to do, so interpreted grammars are often slower to execute than compiled grammars.

If you truly wanted to write code “from scratch,” without the assistance of any software, you’d have to open up your computer and use tiny magnets to manually set the bits in your computer, which, obviously, nobody does.

These days, the most “from scratch” you can get when writing code is simply writing in a plain text file, using notepad or any other text editor, then running a special program called a compiler, which takes in code written in plain text and spits out a program your computer can run.

Although you can use notepad or word, most programmers will use a text editor thats specifically for coding since it might have useful features like auto formatting and syntax highlighting, kind of like word has grammar checking.

Of course, the question then becomes, how did we code the first compiler? Well, at some point in the past, somebody much smarter than I coded the first compiler in pure machine code, just ones and zeroes. It was a very primitive compiler, but it was complex enough that they could use it to compile an even better compiler, and then use that one to compile an even better one, and so on. And now that that’s done, nobody ever has to code “from scratch” again."	1	0

Setting up your development environment is usually a huge pain and it can fail in ways that aren't immediately obvious. If you try to write a more complicated program, maybe you forgot to install something, maybe something broke, but potentially it could also be your program that's the issue. But if you write a hello world, that's super straightforward and you can't mess that up unless you are super new to the language. So if it works, you know that you can start writing whatever program you wanted to build, if it fails, go back to troubleshooting your installation.	10	0

Some VERY VERY low level things like the first stage of a BIOS (the very first thing that executes when your computer powers up) are sometimes written like this, but it's maybe a few dozen instructions at most.

Writing assembly language is *basically* this if you don't use any more advanced features.  The opcodes are usually a 1:1 mapping to instructions.  So you can write something like `ADD r1, r2` and it gets turned into something like `0x00010102` that the CPU can execute natively.  You don't have to remember that `ADD` is instruction `0x0001` and register 1 is `0x01` and register 2 is `0x02`.

Yes.  For many programming languages your source code needs to be ""compiled"" (translated) into something that can be directly executed by an operating system or CPU.  For C/C++ you'd first use a compiler to produce assembly files for each module (`.s`, usually), then an assembler to turn those into 'object files' (`.o`, usually), then a linker to merge all your `.o` files into an executable in a specific format (depending on which operating system you want to run it in).  Modern ""compilers"" tend to bundle all those together into a 'toolchain', for example `gcc` or `clang` can go straight from `.c` files to an executable.  Although internally they still go through multiple translation stages when doing that.

Languages like C# or Java ""compile"" to something resembling 'assembly code' for a virtual machine.  And then you have a runtime interpreter that knows how to either run that code one instruction at a time, or ""compile"" it further to a native executable for whatever architecture it's actually running on.

&gt;Can the editors you mentioned do this

Not directly, they don't come with a compiler.  But editors designed for coding (for example Visual Studio Code) or that are heavily customizable (like vi or Emacs) can be told what instructions should be used to compile and run your code.

&gt;should I think of it as a “editor/compiler” package?

Full-blown IDEs are more like this, yes.  For example Microsoft Visual Studio comes with Microsoft's own C/C++/C# compilers.  A package like https://www.spyder-ide.org/ usually comes bundled with a Python interpreter."	4	0

Open up a notepad document, start typing lines of HTML code. When you're finished just change the .txt extension to .html so that when you click on it your PC knows it should use a web browser to open that file (instead of notepad), and then the web browser reads the code you've typed in there and renders whatever it is you've coded on the screen, voila - website.

Then you take that whatever.html file and upload it to a internet server. Probably rename it to index.html and point your URL at that server and whenver someone goes to [yourshittyurl.com](https://yourshittyurl.com) the server will send that index.html file to the user's browser which will then render that HTML code on the screen for that user.

You can still do that same thing today if you wanted to, but there are a lot of complex tools in place that mean you can skip all that and just push a button to install a CMS (content management system) on your hosting provider's server, then use various plugins or modules that let you design a website by dragging/dropping and configuring various widgets and elements.

It really speeds up development.

I worked on one of the first laser printing systems back in the early 80's, using Xerox's ""Page Description Language"" (PDL) which let us use 'tags' to format blocks of text and images. For example, &lt;b&gt; was used to tag a subhead as ""bold"", while &lt;t1&gt; designated a standard text of Times New Roman, 12 pt, justified left. This was clearly the precursor to today's HTML. 

We didn't have an IDE of any type. Our debug was to write up the text, fill it with all our &lt;tags&gt;, and then print it, and see what it looked like. Lather, rinse, repeat - the software for flowing around the many images in our manuals wasn't exact at the time, and trying to ensure diagrams and text were on the same page *after people had edited other text* was a challenge. So I hope you can see where having an environment where you can change the code in one window, and immediately see the effects in the other window, would really speed up development time."	2	0

There are layers of progressive abstraction which allow programmers to work at a higher level without having to fully understand the underlying mechanisms. 

As an example, consider cooking a pot of spaghetti. You might start with a box of noodles, a can of sauce, some ground meat, and some vegetables. Each one of those ingredients requires a large bit of domain knowledge. The vegetables require a farmer who knows how to grow and harvest. The meat requires a rancher to raise the animals and a butcher to slaughter them. The noodles require wheat to be milled and prepared. The sauce requires a recipe all on its own. You need a pot, clean water, heat to cook with, and a lot of other things that are easy to take for granted. Each component has a complex process before it gets to you. 

In the same way that you could technically create a pot of spaghetti from scratch by doing all of the intermediate steps yourself, you could create a program completely from scratch. However the end product would be awful. You just don’t have the domain expertise to create a better product at every step along the way. 

For this reason, programmers have a set of tools and products that they use to develop better software much faster. We set up development environments on our computers with pre-packaged development kits and software runtimes - just as a cook has a well equipped kitchen. We have access to libraries which can automate common tasks and help structure our software - similar to having appliances like a stove or electric kettle to speed up tasks. There are examples and tutorials to achieve frequent tasks - like a book of recipes."	1	0

Machine Level (CPU known at compile time): These are your C, C++, Rust, etc. You write the file into notepad and get a ""comiler"". That compiler will take your code and turn it into machine code. That machine code can be turned into an executable file and run. Nothing is needed for the program to run once compiled other than an OS to run it.

Runtimes: I write C# for a living. My code is compiled in a pretty similar way, but I can't run it on a computer without a ""Runtime"". This is a dependency and adds more work to deploying applications. It is also a benefit, because a phone, calculator, 32-bit computer, 64-bit computer, and a raspberry pi can all have different runtimes built for their computers. If I say ""WRITE THIS FILE"", my compiled code is executed not against a processor, but against the ""Runtime"". That runtime might just execute the commands as provided, but some CPUs might not support all of the instructions that the runtime does, so it must split the one Runtime command into multiple CPU commands. The reverse is also true, where multiple Runtime commands can sometimes be merged. This process is called ""JIT"" or ""Just in time compiler"".

Runtime + Interpreter: This is an alternate of the previous, but some Runtimes such as Python or Javascript use an interpreter. So all instructions are assembled while the program is running. When you download a .js file in your browser, the system underneath literally runs off the text in the file, and uses that to build CPU instructions. C# (dotnet) has interpreters built on top, but for the most part runs on pre-compiled code.

If you want to start programming from scratch, starting with a Visual Studio console application is nice, because the environment associates the project with the right compiler and debugger. I am also a dotnet/windows guy, which some people don't prefer, I would recommend python or javascript with ""Visual Studio Code"" which is VERY LIGHTWEIGHT AND FREE!!!"	1	0

[Here's a list of error codes](https://kb.iu.edu/d/bfrc). Lets say I cant figure out why my user can't see a specific thing on a web page. And I go in and check under network and see that I get error code 403 Forbidden. Then I know that I don't have permission for this specific user to see that thing and that I need to either make sure my user has that specific permission or change things in the server that allows everyone with another specific permission to see those things.

The console log is good for some easy debugging. Lets say you want to know if a specific part of the code is running, then you could (like many of us do) add console.log(""HERE""); to the code and when that specific part of the code is running it says HERE in the console. The console also reports errors in your code and tells you where in your code something went wrong and why error is showing.

You can also use it by setting breakpoints at specific parts of the code, which means the code will pause when it reaches that line and then you can use the developer tools to move through the code step by step and check the value of variables to make sure they are correct.  Lets say I have a variable called IsAdmin and its value is false. Then I have a function that makes the value of IsAdmin true. And I want to see that it actually sets the value to true, then I can set a breakpoint at the place where it is supposed to get a new value and step just one line down and then check if it was changed correctly

You can edit cookies to see how the web page acts when something is set to true instead of false for instance

IDE's, Integrated Development Environments, can check your code for obvious errors, guess what you want to code next, connect directly to version control, and organize giant projects, among other things. Visual Studio is a very powerful and (in)famous IDE.

Whether you use an IDE or some other text editing program, it's all just plain text in a file. Once that's made, you need to run it through a ""compiler"", which is a program that translates your code into machine code (e.g. binary, 0's and 1's) that a computer can read and run. At this point you have a program that you can execute.

**Transistors / physics / chemical engineering / low-level hardware engineering** \- These are the actual physical buildings blocks required to build digital circuits. At the lowest level, 1's and 0's are just an abstraction for a ""1"" being a signal present and ""0"" being no signal present.

**Logic gates** \- operations that are like ""coding"" for binary - things like setting the 1's and 0's, clearing them out, flipping the bits, etc. and these will then route your signals to different parts of your circuit. You may have heard of some: NAND, OR, NOT, AND, XOR, NOR... It turns out you can start from NAND / NOR and build all other logic gates from there.

**Registries / interrupts / some kind of program feeder** \- Basically some part of your circuit / program needs to be able to take 1's and 0's as input. This is where stuff gets kind of meta, because it turns out code itself can be input / data. Like, you can build a circuit that essentially says, ""Run the next 64 bytes of input""

**Assembly Language / ASM** \- People got tired of writing 1's and 0's by hand pretty quickly and circuits got more advanced quickly as well so we went ahead and wrote programs into circuits that could quickly take more human-friendly stuff and translate it into 0's and 1's for us. These were at first built into the hardware itself, I believe, and then later moved to software. Assembler is in practice how you'd do your low-level 0 and 1 comparisons. See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly\_language#Assembly\_language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language#Assembly_language) for examples but basically you get neat symbolic phrases for your underlying binary operations like MOV, JMP, CMP, etc. (Move, Jump, Compare, etc.)

Assembly Language looks way harder than it is. It's very hard to do well because you need to understand the underlying hardware and how processors optimize running programs under the hood in order to write it efficiently. This is why most people use compilers.

**Interpreters / Compilers / Linkers** \- Okay so this is where we get into ""real"" languages that most of us know now. C, C++, JavaScript, .NET, etc. and should address the question of how most people write code from scratch.

Basically, these days, all modern operating systems (Windows, Linux, MacOS) come with software tools that can compile abstract forms of code - abstract syntax trees - and turn them into native code / machine code that will actually run on the processor. Alternatively, if the code is compiled in ""real-time"", the code you write is typically compiled into ""bytecode"" which is similar to Assembly and then a program compiles it into native code.

So you write C++, that goes through a compiler, which is an honestly massive tool / toolchain that converts your C++ into an abstract form of code, then to assembler or whatever, and then that all gets compiled to binary.

Or you write JavaScript, and that gets pre-compiled to some bytecode type stuff, which is like assembly but not, and that can be executed by a fast JIT compiler / interpreter at ""run-time"" (which means your code often stays in an abstract, non-native / machine code format until it actually needs to execute).

This is a really, really complicated and under-appreciated toolchain. I mean, all the other stuff is under-appreciated as well, but unless you're employed as a core processor engineer at Intel, you can't exactly see the underlying code they use to process your 0's and 1's. On the other hand, all of these tools to convert your C/C++ etc. into stuff that runs on your machine are largely open-source and out there... just never really cared about.

**So in summary... the process for writing code from scratch is as follows:**

* Open some text editor for code (such as Visual Studio Code)
* Follow some tutorial on how to start code in whatever language I want from scratch and setting up my text editor of choice or my build tools.
* Include some necessary libraries in my code to make cool stuff possible (provided by the operating system or language / platform I am developing on). For example, graphics libraries, audio libraries, stuff for input and output like keyboard, mouse, networking, etc.
* ...
* Write my c0d3z
* Hit compile or run
* Fix some mistakes that you figure I'd stop making after 15 years of software development experience, and then hit compile / run a couple more times.
* ...
* The platform / language / runtime / operating system toolchain then goes through the process of taking that code, converting it into something the low-level system tools for creating the assembler or binary code will understand, and then the operating system loads that binary and feeds it to the processor.
* And because of the system code libraries and tools in place that I imported into my own code, I can do stuff like talk to the operating system or graphics card or keyboard / mouse / etc. and make actual stuff that's useful. This is like... necessary in modern programming... Unless you're programming robots, you typically don't write directly to hardware anymore, but rather ask the operating system / nVidia's graphics driver APIs nicely to please draw something on the screen and then maybe they put some pixels on your computer monitor. Or maybe you brick your entire graphics card on accident. Who knows? Anything can happen.

(Word does formatting etc., text editors are more primitive, what you write is exactly what lands on the disk).

Some languages or more complex require a lot of ""boilerplate"" (structure that is usually copied from a template), but for others, the way you start a small project is literally opening a blank text file and start writing code.

That code then needs to be either *compiled*  (you use an existing program to turn human readable source into machine code) or *interpreted* (you run another program, which then reads the source and follows the instructions) to actually run it. This will then use tons of things other people wrote long ago, which is why you only need to do so little.

Wanna try it yourself? Open a text editor (e.g. notepad), copy this into it: `&lt;script&gt;for (i=0; i&lt;10; i++) { document.write(i); }&lt;/script&gt;` and save it as something.html (make sure it's not something.html.txt, on Windows you may have to enable seeing file extensions and rename it). Then open it with Firefox or Chrome, and you should see your very own first program write the digits from 0 to 9. Your browser acts as the interpreter here. (Note that this is VERY ""dirty"" code that's ""wrong but still understandable"", I wanted to keep it short.)

If you're the first human writing the first ever compiler or interpreter, you might literally be punching holes in a punch card or flipping switches to set bits or weaving magnets onto strings. You will use that to create a very primitive first tool, which you then use to write a slightly more complex one. You will then repeat that a few times."	1	0

You write code with a program that edits text and doesn't add extra information (like notepad rather than word) and save the file with a suffix that indicates what language it is (like .rb for ruby or .py for python). From there a compiler or interpreter is called to transform the code into machine instructions that the computer can execute, which makes the instructions in the code happen. Most people use fancier editors than notepad that help with organization, syntax, etc. and many languages have popular frameworks for combining many files into projects for organization and readability purposes, but in the end its all writing text files which follow the rules of a programming language to give instructions to a computer to execute.	1	0

When we program we typically use special text editors made for programming. (They have specific tools and stuff that help a lot, kind of like how word can auto capitalize the first word of a sentence. That said, you don't need to write in one of those programs, it's just more convenient.	1	0

Way back in the day, like say the 1940s, ""programming"" a ""computer"" was a matter of physically connecting a bunch of wires and switches in a specific way so that electricity would do a specific thing. Gradually we started making this easier on ourselves. 

For instance, somebody asked themselves ""Why do I have to switch this switch myself, when we I can just install a little motor that does it for me?"" So now you've got switches that tell the motors how to switch a bunch of *other* switches that actually control the primary thing you're trying to do.

Eventually you're not physically switching anything at all; you're typing up lines of code and you've taught the computer how to interpret the code so it'll do what the code says. And originally these were actual *codes*, like ""20ABG39"" or whatever. You had to be an expert to have any idea what any of this was supposed to do.

Eventually this got even easier, as we learned to write things like ""if x=3, [do thing]"", and the computer translates that into codes which in turn get translated into actual electrical activity which does the thing you're trying to do. So at this point code had become human-readable.

So now there's stuff on top of *that*. Typically you'll use a program called an IDE which helps you write code. Which means that someone coded a program that helps you code programs.

And that's the answer. If you want to see a free IDE in action, look up replit"	1	0

While yes people can open a text editor and begin typing code, this is not typical anymore. Most people would start with a template they either used on other projects, they got from someone else, a coworker, etc. There is no point in reinventing the wheel so most times you borrow structure from other apps or people.

To add to this, there are libraries you can use as well. Libraries consist of one or more features to allow you to do something with your program. 

Consider this: You are building an application that needs to connect to a database. Your options are to build every connection and query in your code. Or alternatively, you could use a library designed to connect to a database. So instead of manually building connections and queries you would call methods for each of these functions; like connect() or query(). Then you simply fill in the blanks such as database host, name, password, etc. 

Using libraries accelerates app development, is typically more secure (assuming the user base isn't one person and there is some form of oversight), and allows for better consistency and integration across platforms. Libraries could be written for your specific application, they might be community provided/supported, or a vendor may publish libraries to work with their services/applications."	3	0

In many cases yes, I write batch scripts for all sorts of things, if i've got a command line program, like aria or Wget i'll write a text based frontend so it can help me use the program without remembering each and every switch. I use Notepad for it and just start typing out a basic outline of what I want then refine it once the basics work. Often, even if it's just for me, i'lll have a help option in the menu to remind me of certain aspects of the program. 

Take Aria, it's a really good command line based download manager, I mostly use it for downloading off Archive.org and it's especially useful for large quantities of individual files, like a SNES rompack. The help file is slightly wrong (it's the section on filtering links in a spreadsheet) and it's hardly the neatest code but [if you want to take a look you can do](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kvrFNIOWFhCtvygplqt-fmbsGm1emIbu/view?usp=sharing).

Nobody is making programs from scratch with just a text editor, they are using various tools along side of it.  Examples of such tools include, but are not limited to:

* compiler, obviously
* debugger
* source tagging systems (intellisense, etc.; things which highlight errors directly in your text editor)
* performance profilers
* source history control tools (git, svn, hg, perforce, etc.)

And while modern Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) attempt to package the above tools and more all into the same program (like Visual Studio), maybe the most important tool you will use in software development is documentation.  In practice, you will be constantly referencing documentation while you are building a program of any size.  Without having things open on the side to reference, like tutorials, API documentation, language documentation, usage examples, etc., you are going to be doing a very slow and/or poor job most likely.

So I would say no, in reality it's very far from just opening a text editor and going ham; there's a lot more to it than that."	1	0

Like with if/then operators - how do you do that with a series of 0's and 1's?

Logic gates and registers at a fundamental level. Essentially a CPU is broken up into a bunch of smaller things that do other things, like adding or conditionals, and the order of sequences you send to the computer determines how those values are interpreted.

To use an example in English, how do you know when a word starts and ends? The empty space between letters indicates a new word. How do you know when the sentence ends? Typically through punctuation, such as a period or question mark. How do you know if there's a paragraph? An indentation at the start of a new line.

These ""grammar rules"" are built into computers as well. The CPU has a set number of ""bits"" for each set of instructions, and each bit is a single binary digit, a 1 or 0. When you hear things like 32-bit process or 64-bit processor, this is referring to the instruction ""size"" the CPU is designed for.

Generally speaking the first ""byte"" (depending on architecture) is the instruction code, and a byte is 8 bits. So 1101 0011 would be 8 bits and 1 byte. If that instruction is ""compare the values that follow if the first is bigger return true otherwise false"" you might have ""1101 0011 0001 0011 0100 0010"" as your total command. Translated, this is ""compare 0001 (1) to 0100 (4), and if (1) is greater than (4), store 0001 into register 0100 0010, otherwise store 0000"". The result of this instruction would be that 0100 0010, which is an address somewhere else, would have the result of 0000 stored in it, which could then be used to calculate something else later on.

I'm *heavily* modifying the complexity of what's going on, and ~~nerds~~ graduate CS guys are probably yelling about how CPU architecture doesn't match this exactly due to memory sizes and standard instruction sets, but the basic concept is true and I don't feel like looking it up in my old textbooks. Sorry.

But without getting too technical, the idea is that everything a CPU can do is built in and standardized, and the computers send a series of instructions (usually reading from memory, which is your RAM, which stands for ""Random Access Memory"") to the CPU, it translates the commands into some sort of output, and that output is written back into RAM for future commands to read and manipulate.

Incidentally, this is part of the reason why rebooting systems tends to fix a lot of problems...RAM is cleared when you reboot and the system goes through it's entire startup procedure, which often fixes memory leaks and other strange errors caused by different programs all screwing around with your RAM and leaving chunks of data everywhere. IT guys aren't telling you to reboot because they enjoy making you have to reopen your 1,076 Chrome windows, they're doing it because it actually fixes an extremely high number of common problems due to clearing out the RAM and CPU of all existing data and instructions.

&gt;Is it all just built on sequentially building layers of complexity?

Yup. One of the dirty secrets of computer engineering is that *nobody* actually understands all of the systems we're using. Even if you learn the low level stuff, trying to trace all the additional layers of complexity up to the pixels turning on and off on your screen is a lifetime's worth of knowledge that no one human possesses. And when you toss in internet architecture things get real weird real fast.

The good news is that you don't really need to know all those details to program. I learned the basics of how computers work as part of my computer engineering degree, sure, but I haven't used it once since I left the university. The bad news is that one of the reasons why so much software crashes all the time and has a million bugs is because people don't need to know all the technical details to program.

And more importantly, they don't have the time, since writing software *properly* is slow, and customers generally care more about having software now vs. having software that works consistently. Unless you are into embedded development for stuff like car brakes, nuclear reactor sensors, plane gyros, and pacemakers, in which case that software is typically tested and written *really* carefully. But that stuff tends to be more simple (relatively speaking) than general commercial software and often takes many years to create despite being much smaller in scope.

All tangents aside, the ""layers of complexity"" is basically it."	1	0

In computer science, lower level means ""closer to the hardware"", so for instance the lowest level you can go is programming directly in ones and zeroes (computer chips only work with binary). Since this is very hard to do, a language was created to translate from really basic (but still human readable) instructions to ones and zeroes. This is called Assembly, and it is at a higher level than ""ones and zeroes"".   
Assembly is still a pain in the ass to work with, because you have to tell the computer how to do EVERYTHING. Picture trying to teach an alien to cook a meal, you have to go into so much detail.   
So other languages were created which ""abstract"" common instructions (in this sense, abstracting means to make something simpler/without unnecessary detail), and they are even easier for humans to read and write. These lay at a higher level still and we would call them ""Programming Languages"": C++, Python, etc.   
The highest level language would be natural language, so English, Japanese, etc. You can speak to other people at very high levels of abstraction, you can say for instance ""add salt to taste"" without going into the specifics of ""humans like X amount of salt per Y amount of food, so keep the salt in the ranges of Z%"".

Word processors are for putting words on a page. They feature fancy formatting (indenting, margins, bold, italic, centering, etc.) They often have highlighting for English: misspelled words, bad grammar.

Text editors are for ""mostly"" unformatted"" text. They don't support margins or pages. They don't support arbitrary bold/italic. (But sometimes they support it via ""markdown"", where it can use the text to control the formatting like ""\*foo\*"" to make ""**foo**"" bold.)

Text editors often let you see your whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) because most programming languages are often VERY sensitive to things you can't ""see"" in a normal document. (For example, when words in a sentence wrap around to the next line, it could be because the display formatted them, or because I put a ""newline"" in there.  You can't tell when reading the document. But computers care.)

Text editors sometimes have ""syntax coloring"" that helps you visually ""parse"" the code you are writing. (i.e. all keywords are one color, all variables are another color, strings and numbers get their own colors, etc.). This can can help prevent mechanical coding mistakes like forgetting to  close your quotes, or balance your parenthesis. Some will even run the compiler in the background, and give you feedback on where the compiler is confused because your code is broken.

Sometimes the text editor is entirely ""CLI"" (Command Line Interface, i.e. the green and black text of a terminal you see in hacker movies.). Sometimes the editors are graphical. 

Text editors can also be full-blown IDEs. (Integrated Development Enviroments). These let you push a button to compile / test your code, and helps you navigate between files in your project. Sometimes they even integrate a debugger."	1	0

This has an interface that makes it very easy for you to understand how to make the fox do what you want, but in terms of a programming language that would be represented in text:  `move fox 2 squares forward`.

As others have mentioned programming languages use keywords to have a common set of rules like grammar, syntax, etc, similar to english. If you don't use proper english, someone may misunderstand you. Programming is no different, you just wind up with software bugs instead of a confused partner in conversation. In the case of this language, we might consider the word 'move' to be keyword. We might also require that something like _what_ you want to mvoe follows, along with how many spaces they should move and the direction. If you turn this into a programming language, it might look something like this:
`fox.move(direction.forward, 2)`

&gt;what is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter? the language: can you elaborate?

So, basically, every line of code that a developer writes has to be *translated* to some form of language that the hardware can understand (this is usually, if not always, binary). Practically no one writes software in binary code, therefore we use what's called *high level* languages, that are programming languages easy to understand/read from an human perspective

Since the hardware can't read these high level languages, we have to translate them to binary code. Here's where this compiler/interpreter thing comes into play. A language that's *compiled* is a language that, to run, has to be translated to binary all at once and we give the binary file to the hardware. A language that's *interpreted* is a language that isn't compiled as a bundle, but read line by line and translated each line individually to binary as we read it.

They basically do the same thing, converting from high level to machine code, the difference lays in when they do this conversion, previously or in runtime.

&gt;can you get more into what people lack to program \_for a living\_?

This is kinda relative but, in my experience, successful developers are developers with great critical thinking and logic analysis: problem solvers. Language is just a tool to solve them, anyone can write a linea of code and make it work, but not anyone can solve a problem with it"	2	0

* The cards were handed over to the operator who would compile &amp; run the program (if it compiled OK).
* The operator would give us back the cards and the print out of the run.
* We would correct any errors, [creating new cards](https://historictech.com/product/icl-hand-punch-card-machine-from-1969/)for the changes.

The CPU has, at the very least, knowledge of a specific memory address, and the ability to get the value from that specific memory address.   


Computers work by reading values from memory, interpreting those values as instructions, executing them, and moving ahead in the memory. So, when writing a program, we want to put a set of instructions somewhere in the memory and then telling the computer to start executing a program from there.   


Modern operating systems abstract and simplify a lot of that, up to a point where there's already existing programs that do most of the hard parts, and you just have to write the instructions for what you want to happen.   


So, for an example, in a very simple language, all you need to write into a text file is  
`print ""Hello world""`

and that can be fed to a program which creates a program that prints out the text.   
This already assumes a lot of things, such as having files, having somewhere for print command to output, having a program which interprets the text and turns it into a program that can be run in some sensible way.  


The simplest way to try this out is, in a chromium-based browser, hit **ctrl+shift+i,** click to the bottom of the appearing dialog, type in   
`console.log(""hello, world"")`

This works because modern browsers are incredibly complex and powerful pieces of software - I mean, people have run older versions of windows inside a browser - and you can access the console - the command line of browsers this easily.  Browsers interpret and execute this code on the fly.   


If you want to store this fancy code you write, you need to put it into a text file - a special text file, with typically .js filetype. As others have mentioned, you can create a HTML file. If you put into that script file,   
`&lt;script src=""test.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;`

Then, create a file in the same folder called ""test.js"" into which you put the console.log command.

Now, if you open the file and hit **ctrl+shift+i,** you should see ""hello world"" in the console, showing that your code was executed."	1	0

So, yes, in the simplest form, you literally just type it one character at a time into some form of editor. The text is the input to the other program; the output (at an ELI5 level) is a program the computer can run. 

(The ""editor"" at my first job was a pool of typists who turned the text I wrote on 80-column pads into decks of punch cards, one card per line. And they had no idea what the things I wrote meant, but they were seriously good at typing it exactly.)

They often have features such as debugging, syntax error checking on the fly(similar to grammar and spell checking in word), and a single button press compiling feature. Compiling is when you turn your code into an executable program. Like an exe file on windows. It’s also possible to write code on regular text editors and compile via command line and this is what they made us do in college. I don’t prefer it. I’m talking about stuff like notepad++, vim, or eMacs. I’ve never tried to write code on Microsoft Word because I don’t think the compiler would like all the extra formatting it throws in even if it could read through a docx file. It’s also worth mentioning that if you are developing something complex like a video game or web application there is usually a code base called a framework that you build off of. Developers rarely develop anything completely from scratch these days. You are usually always using someone else’s code inside your own code.	1	0

This technology goes all the way back to the late nineteenth century. Before general purpose computers were a thing we had tabulating machines. These were used to crunch numbers and process large amounts of data. The company that would become ibm got its start making a machine to process the results of the 1890 census. These machines were a game changer, but their biggest limitation was that each tabulation machine could only perform one or a few functions. You might have one machine to sum a large list of numbers, and another machine to sort data. What we would now call a computer resulted in insights into logic and mathematics. It was already known that any algorithm (a set of instructions that are followed exactly) could be carried out by a machine, but it was thought that you needed a different kind of machine for each kind of algorithm you wanted to implement. The Alan Turing and Alonzo Church (and actually some other people as well) figured out that it was possible to build a machine could perform any algorithm simply by changing the information given to the machine. That information we call a program. At first programs were recorded in punched cards just like the previous tabulating machines used. Programming the first general purpose computers was very difficult. You had to understand the entire system and reason about how the numbers you were putting into the computer would cause the computer to behave as you wished. To an extent, that still what programmers do, but we don’t (often) think in terms of the exact machine instructions and all the minutia of the exact details of the hardware.	1	0

Compiled programs typically end up as machine code which is unreadable to us humans but very efficient for a computer to run.

Kinda roughing it, but that's a valid method, and definitely the easiest to do (don't know many who can't open notepad)

A lot of programming languages also have tools made that can help check for typos, errors, add in mandatory lines at the start, etc. 

The big ones I know of and have used are Visual BASIC &amp; PyCharm, but there's one for most common languages. These types of programs are fairly helpful; especially for beginners.

That said, starting is as simple as opening up notepad and typing out:

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=""en""&gt;

&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta charset=""UTF-8""&gt;

The most common examples are Visual Studio on Windows and XCode on a Macintosh. Both of these allow you to write and edit code in various languages such as C/C++/etc, *compile* it into binary, *link* it (with other compiled code modules or libraries of functions) into an executable program. The IDE also lets you define non-code *resources* such as windows, alerts, buttons, menus that are included in your program and are often read by your code in order to present a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to users of your program. Programs can also be written that are normally used from a command line prompt and have no need for a GUI. 

IDEs usually have a Help menu that describes how to make calls to the underlying Windows or Mac Operating System (OS), usually to do stuff like use a resource to show a window or react to a menu choice and many, many others. 

Programs can be extremely complicated and consist of hundreds of thousands of lines of code - or may be a simple little program with a dozen lines to make a microprocessor blink an LED. 

Some people call web page development “coding”, but when developing a website you are often editing a Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) file. This file along with other html files, scripts, and other data is read and interpreted by your web browser and is not therefore a standalone program."	1	0

For most modern platforms, you will start off downloading something or in your terminal. 

For react app, you’d download npm and node for instance.

For python you’d use something like Django and some package manager for python.

For PHP, you’d use composer and something like XMAPP or WAMP along with Laravel or Wordpress.

For C#, Visual studio provides you with blocks to start off with.

Rarely do programmers start completely from scratch. The majority of programmers focus on efficiency and don’t want to rewrite things that can essentially be done for you to begin with.

Once your boilerplate is up though, new pages or blocks are generally written from scratch.

Edit: even before I used package managers and git (version management), I’d still copy pasta boiler plate stuff like html tags. I’ve written a membership site with no base code before but it probably took double the time I’d need if I had used a framework."	1	0

But you can just open a plain text editor and type code into an empty .txt file. 

This is the fun bit though. It's entirely possible to write an compiler that will read the font and use that for it's mapping (LaTeX!?). BOLD means strong typed, italics means it's autoclosable, underlined means it's unsafe, red text is synchronized.

There's 2 pieces here. You generally have lines of code in some programming language. They can be written in most text editors. Then you have either a compiler or an interpreter. A compiler will take the text file(s) and convert it to a machine executable program (.exe if you are on windows) which you can then run or a library for another program to reference. And in the case of the interpreter, it simple executes the code directly.

So you can work either with these things as separate pieces, OR you can combine all of them into an Integrated Development Environment. Aka an IDE. Visual Studio is an IDE because it allows to you edit the text files, and then compile and run the program all from one single place.  There are other IDE's such as PyCharm for example. Many of InteliJ's Products are IDE's for various programming languages.  Visual Studio Code is a text editor that has a plugin system and if you add the right plugins, it can transform into an IDE for your favorite programming language."	2	0

All an application/program is at the end of the day is a set of instructions telling the computer how to react in specific situations. Practically, most code is written in Integrated Development Environments (IDE's) which are apps specifically designed to help improve a programmer's experience writing in a given language.	2	0

Network tab lets you see HTTP requests and responses - useful with today's dynamic pages, AJAX and Single Page Applications. Some IDEs have the same feature, otherwise you'd use something like Wireshark.

Elements let you see and change the runtime DOM, which is different to the page source because of JavaScript dynamically changing it. It's really a HTML-specific thing but the closest IDE equivalent would be watch variables.

Sources lets you see the page source for debugging, the difference between this and View Source is that this one lets you map the live site to your original source code, before it gets minified/obfuscated. Another feature that is native to IDEs, often using Debug Symbols (which map bytecode/machine code to source code).

**TL;DR: the starting point is a text file, which is given to a translation program for the computer to understand.**

1. Computers understand numbers as instructions. How does it do this? The processor is physically built to perform specific actions based on specific inputs. As a toy example, it might be that when a processor sees ""1"", it then takes the next two numbers in line and outputs the sum. The collection of instructions a processor understands is called an ""instruction set"".

2. Programming languages provide a way to write instructions, such as ""1+2"" or ""sum(1, 2)"".

3. A programmer will write their instructions into a file or group of files. This collection of files written in whatever language(s) they are using is called the ""source code"".

4. Then the programmer passes their source code to another program that translates from the source code files into instructions the processor understands. To continue the example from earlier, this would take the source code ""sum(1,2)"" and turn it into ""1 1 2"" for the processor.

The program that does this translation is either an ""interpretor"" that does the translations on the fly (i.e., you run the interpreter, provide the files, and the interpreter provides the processor the instructions), or a ""compiler"" that does the translation into new files. Those new files may be run directly by the processor, or be run by another interpretor.

Programming languages are effectively just the instructions that ""translation"" programs understand.

---

This might make you ask, ""Where do the translation programs come from?""

Someone, somewhere, at some time, used the base ""instruction set"" to write a basic translation program, and from there, more people have used those basic translation programs to produce more complex ones."	1	0

The oldest language I worked with, around 10 years ago (back then, my country still had basic internet, so I guess my country was still using stuff outdated by 10 years, so read my 10 years ago as 20 years ago to estimate what level of tech was in any developed country at the time) was C++. 

C++ is a compiler. What it does is, it converts my written programs into code that my operating system (i.e. windows and all) can convert into assembly language (i.e. the language that can communicate with the CPU) at runtime and send it to the CPU, and then the assembly language gets converted into bits (i.e. 0s and 1s; digital switch flips) and then it gets executed. 

Why this way? Because assembly language is a lot less readable than the C++ language, and requires a lot less knowledge about memory (i.e. RAM) addresses. While that already greatly simplifies stuff, C++ also comes with a shitton of modules that you can insert in your programs to reduce the amount of work. Plus, it allows you to further import modules perpared by other people. 

Assume you want to draw a circle on the screen. Normally, you'd have to write the code to do that from scratch. However, if you import someone else's pre-existing code, you just have to make reference to the function they have written for drawing the cicle, and Bob's your uncle.

So, all in all, the foundation is already there. You're writing in a simplified language that a compiler can read and you're importing code that someone else had already written beforehand."	1	0

High level code, like C and variants, are simply compiled one-to-many machine code.  Low level code like ASM is merely compiled one to one code.  Hell, writing machine code directly like they did with the very first applications ever made is as close as you can get to ""true"" coding.

Scripts are interpreted by a script engine.  The script is not, nor will it ever be machine code.  Since you are not creating anything that will result in machine code, you are not coding.  You are scripting.

Even something like Java, with it's agnostic bytecode, is technically code, because the JIT is compiling the bytecode into native machine code on the fly."	0	0

Like anything else, before you start working you should make a plan.

What does your program look like visually? You need to have a design.

What content is on your page?

How will your program be digested? Are your users on a desktop computer, mobile, tablet, all of the above? Consider how your app, website, program will be used and how the design will change between different formats. This is called responsive design. Instead of making three or four different versions of a web page, you make one that adapts to different screen sizes.

Once you understand these things you can start writing code. And yes, you can use any text editor.

But wait, there are thousands of different frameworks you can use for front end or backend development. Are you looking for something that loads fast, something that loads a bit slower, but it's really zippy once it's loaded? You also might want to consider search engine optimization. You need to consider who your audience is and how they are likely to use it. A recipe website will want to load quickly. A page you use for work may have a longer initial load time, but you want it to be fast after that. There are different frameworks suitable for either example. They each have pros and cons.

There are other considerations, naturally. If you have interest in learning, YouTube has an enormous amount of resources for beginners for free. I'd be glad to share more if you have specific questions."	1	0

To me it wa something he did at work and I always figured he had a special program for making it all spit out the right stuff.

His method of teaching was always ""well figure it out"" which I can absolutely do...but he never really explained the starting point!"	2	0

How it basically works:
- You have an idea
- You make the concept
- You choose the best language and program to help you make it happen

This of course is just simplified but thats basically how it goes.

The programs we use, also called IDEs (Integrated Development Environment) help a lot and make the job easier and more efficient and fun.

You can open Notepad and type your code, but why do that when you have amazing IDEs that format your code, have awesome colors (which make the code more readable), have tons of features to help you fix errors (debugging) and also support tons and tons of plugins to further expand your toolbox.

Again, it all depends on what you want to do. I like the JetBrains products, so If I am to write a small Python program, I would use PyCharm.
If I want to practice my C/C++ then I will use CLion or if I am to build a full functioning website my choice will be PHPStorm.

There are also many online tools for quick drafts like JSFiddle, Codeplay, Codesandbox ... that we can use to make something small very quickly. If I want to quickly see how an event behaves in JS, I would use one of the above mentioned tools. If I want to test a new function in PHP, that I never used before, I would use an Online PHP-Editor.

No matter what program you choose, you need an idea first, then to make a detailed concept and finally realize it by using the best suited programming language and software."	1	0

Ethylene signals the leaves to stop growing, break down their chlorophyll and send nutrients back to the tree, then die. At the same time, a plant hormone called Abscisic acid (ABA) starts to form an abscission layer—a small area at the base of the leaf that’s designed to break easily and cleanly so that the leaf drops without breaking anything in the twig. Once the tree has retrieved any nutrients it can from the leaf and the abscission layer is complete, the leaf will drop without much force. A gust of wind or a change in temperature or a little rain will snap off the dead leaf on the breakable abscission layer.	53	0

It’s part of the process of going dormant for winter.

It is expensive for trees to operate in the winter in temperate climates. There’s less sun to use, there’s less water available since trees can’t access water that’s frozen solid. To keep leaves working through the winter, trees would need to produce something to prevent freezing and continuously repair damage while getting a reduced benefit from the leaves. Keeping leaves is also a risk when there’s snow or freezing rain because the leaves catch the precipitation and that can cause the tree to break if the load becomes too heavy.

Pine trees and other evergreens get around this problem with a combination of different adaptations. The needle shaped leaves lose less water and catch less snow. The branches are arranged in a way that lets snow roll off more easily. The sap has components that serve as antifreeze. Combined, these let evergreens keep operating through the winter.

Deciduous trees instead maximize efficiency in the warmer months and go dormant through the winter. Deciduous tree leaves and branches maximize the amount of sun they get with big flat leaves and branches that spread far from the trunk and as high up as possible. This lets deciduous trees take full advantage of the sun’s energy when it’s strongest."	7	0

Different layers of AR coatings are added to prevent different wavelengths of light from coming back out at you. 

This is similar to how active noise cancellation on headphones work. In ANC headphones a microphone picks up sound and then it generates an opposite sound wave that cancels out the original sound wave. So the AR coatings just do the same thing but with light instead of sound. 

Since the process isn't perfect, especially due to the curved nature of glasses, that is why you can usually see a blue/green tint to the reflections on your AR coated glasses."	9	0

Whenever the speed of a wave changes, some of it is reflected back.  (This is true for sound and water waves too).

Anti reflective coatings have a speed of light in between air and glass.  This means there’s a less sudden transition in wave speed, and so no reflection.

The amount of reflection depends on the wavelength (color) of the light and the thickness of the coating too, so the small amount of light that is reflected will be colored.

It does indeed let more light in to the picture you’re framing, and lets more light out, but the big advantage is keeping bright reflections from blocking your view of the art."	5	0

The batteries take up so much space and weight that it is a critical part of the cars design.

Batteries are typically mounted in the floor of the car because having the weight lower is good for the cars handling. This compartment also has to be armored and protected, because a breach in a lithium battery can cause a raging fire, but this is just like the need to protect a fuel tank from rupturing.

But all this weight has some big drawbacks. In gas powered cars the weight of the car is reduced as you drive as more and more gas is burned off. This makes the car more fuel efficient with time, while electric cars never get lighter because they always have to tow that weight.

The extra weight is also harder on the tires, causing them to wear out more quickly.

Electric cars also don't have traditional heaters. The heaters in gas cars are part of the engines cooling system, gas engines produce a lot of haste heat which is recycled to warm the inside of the car. While in electric cars the motors don't produce enough heat to power a traditional blower heater so an electric heater is required. Tesla's also use a coolant system for the battery packs which is also used to warm the cars interior.

But in the grand scheme of things electric cars are still superior to gas cars in a lot of ways. There's less moving parts so they break down less frequently. They require less maintenance, and the use of regenerative breaking means the breaks wear out slower as well. So much of the cars parts last longer compared to gas powered cars.

Electric cars are also much more efficient and cleaner for the environment, even when you consider where the electricity is coming from and the manufacturing waste + disposal. Although this is constantly improving with the environment in mind.

You can usually swap engines between diesel and gasoline cars and leave everything else in place and it would work just fine. Even things like fuel tanks and hoses are usually the same.

Where there are differences they are minor, if any, and not important for the proper running of the car. For example the fuel neck might be a bit different if it is designed to prevent you from putting the wrong type of gas in it. There are also different emissions reducing measures, diesel cars can have exhaust additives and different exhaust components. The sensors in the exhaust for diesel and gasoline engines might also be different. Diesel engines also prefer slower speeds so the gears in diesel cars can be a bit higher.

And then you get into the systems on older mechanical cars. Gasoline engines have vacuum in their manifold and this vacuum was used for things like brake boosters and windshield wipers in older cars. Diesel engines does not have any vacuum although some come with a vacuum pump fitted. Diesel engines always have a governor to control their speed which means the throttle cable can be hooked directly up to a lever for a cruise control, while gasoline cars need more elaborate systems for their cruise control.

But essentially there is not much difference and there are conversion kits out there to swap cars between gasoline and diesel."	-1	0

Tesla Model 3 performance weighs around 200kg more than a BMW M3. The battery does make up the bulk of the weight but in return you lose the engine and gearbox so that's why the weight difference isn't actually that much, especially when you add the weight of fuel as at that point the difference amounts to that of one adult passenger. And the extra weight is in the floor which does indeed help handling. It is well protected and it should also be noted that EVs are around 10x less likely to catch fire than ICE cars based on available stats. The fire in a lithium pack is also well contained as it doesn't spread like a liquid fuel does, large amounts of water are used to keep the pack cool to prevent the fire propagating between cells, not because the fire is actually difficult to put out.

Tyre wear isn't actually that different because the weight isn't that different, and in fact EVs are more controlled in their power delivery so tyres last about the same amount of time, if not better. I got 60,000km (~40,000 miles) out of a set of tyres with my Model 3.

You're right about maintenance, both my EVs have needed extremely minimal maintenance and I've got a combined 150,000km (~90,000 miles) on them. Also, the cost is all up front so yes, they're more expensive initially, but with annual running costs of around 10% that of an ICE car you're going to be catching up fast in the ICE, especially if the price of fuel and parts leaps. But that would never happen......"	6	0

And some Governments still offer tax breaks as incentives to EV owners.

But this won't always be the case. Eventually EV incentives will stop, and Governments will start charging a 'road tax' or something similar to EV owners because you don't pay gas taxes and therefore don't contribute to the cost of maintaining the roads.

But by that point the cost of EVs will likely have gone down significantly, and the cost of gas will likely have gone up significantly as well. Let alone if the government starts charging a carbon tax on gas powered cars to get them off the road."	5	0

The same distance in my old Mazda 6 would have needed around 40 litres of fuel which is currently $120. This is definitely well in favour of the EV.

I got no tax breaks when I bought either of our cars although now there's an incentive scheme for cars under $80,000 but my Model 3 is over that. However, we currently don't pay road user charges and that will definitely come in but hopefully not at the level for diesel vehicles which are generally much heavier and dirtier. They need to price it such that a hybrid isn't cheaper to run than an EV which with the way it looks at the moment is a distinct possibility and would kill the EV market.

When I originally bought our LEAF I figured it would take 8 years for it to break even versus the purchase and running costs on our old Mazda but with increasing prices that actually happened around 6 years and we're well ahead now. With more and more options, buying an ICE car today looks a bit silly to me except in special circumstances and in all but the really dirt cheap end of the market there are very comparable priced EVs. Here in NZ, a Toyota Camry hybrid costs just a little less than a Model 3 RWD and the running costs on the Toyota would more than overtake the difference in price in just a single year.

So whatever we get, it's not a visible image anyways, but rather an image that we translate from radio waves.

For example, when we got the images of the black hole using radio telescopes all over the Earth, we were trying to simulate a telescope the size of the Earth.

When trying to differentiate between light sources, if they are too far away, they get smaller, and too small, we can't differentiate between them. The theoretical maximum for angular resolution of a telescope is θ = 1.22λ/D where that's angular separation of the features you're trying to identify in radians, wavelength of light, and diameter of the telescope.

To put angular resolution into perspective, holding your thumb at arm's length is about 1° wide in your field of view, the moon is about 1/2°.

So we want a big telescope, but we can't actually cover the Earth with one big telescope, so we use our knowledge of how light moves and the smaller telescopes as data points, and we fill in the blanks around it until we get one image."	3	0

Maybe a visualisation helps, though it might not be entirely correct.

For a telescope the resolution is calculated by the wavelength and the diameter of the mirror. The larger the mirror, the better the resolution.
Now imagine a 100 meter diameter mirror. It has some resolution. If you make a hole in it, the diameter stays the same. So the resolution is the same. If you keep making the hole bigger, the diameter will still stay the same, although most of the mirror is gone.
Where this now breaks down is that you have a ring instead of two single points. But now imagine you split the ring in multiple segments, now you have a lot of single mirrors but the resolution still stays the same. Not a perfect analogy, but the basics are still the same. In terms of resolution two distant dishes (in Radio) working together have the same resolution as one big dish.
The difference is the mich lower collectin area which collect the light and reflect it to the receiver.

Basically, having a network of tiny radio telescopes at a great distance from each other is like having a super-high-resolution TV with the brightness set extremely low, while a single massive telescope is like having a low-resolution TV at a reasonable brightness setting. Ideally, you want lots of large telescopes. Recently, construction was started on the Square Kilometre Array, which should eventually have a large number of dishes spread across large swathes of Southern Africa and Australia (the area and distance between the telescopes aren't the only factors, by the way - you also need a lot of data throughput, precise timing, and low radio noise).

This lets you see dimmer stars or pick up smaller asteroids on radar because the signal doesn't get washed out by the sensor's standard noise

The further apart the edges are the better you can discern fine detail and the less impacted by edge effects your final image is.

Each of the telescopes still works like a normal telescope, but if you can pipe all their data together then you can start treating them like a bigger one.  What ends up mattering is the angles from the outside of your aperture to the target and by making the aperture bigger the angles get bigger and you can discern smaller details.  If your aperture is too small then it doesn't matter how bright your image is because the fuzzing from edge effects is going to mean everything is fuzzy no matter what you do.

So you're on the right track.  Three 20 meter dishes can collect 3x as many photons as 1 20 meter dish, but if spaced carefully and well measured they can give you better resolution but you're still only going to see things that are a third as bring as your single telescope could"	1	0

In ambient conditions, radioactive elements with unstable atomic structure are basically falling apart slowly. In turn, they only released a small amount of energy as they do so.

With fission, you speed up the process by shooting a bunch neutrons at the radioactive atoms so they fall apart much, much faster. So much faster that neutrons in the radioactive atoms explode out, hit other atoms and cause them to break apart too. If the effect is strong enough, you get a chain reaction that produces a lot of energy (but also causes all your radioactive fuel to ""fall apart"" faster).

Normal decay is random.  A U-235 decays and then nothing else happens, there's no chain reaction

In nuclear reactors the fuel is refined and set up in the reactor so it'll be critical so each atom that splits causes one other atom to split.  Now you're not waiting for each one to randomly breakdown by instead trigging a chain reaction that works its way through the fuel fairly rapidly splitting the available atoms into smaller ones.  If they need more power from the reactor they briefly adjust the control rods so each split triggers more than one other split to get up to a higher power level then reduce it back to 1-1 to hold at that level.  The more power you need to pull from the reactor the faster you need to burn through the fuel

They also don't burn through all the fuel of the fuel rod, but it starts building up byproducts that muck with the power you can get out of it so they have to swap it out.  Unfortunately the byproducts are wayyy less stable than the starting uranium/plutonium so now the random decay is occurring at a much faster rate creating a lot more radiation but less useful kinetic energy(heat) from the process.

If these dominoes are set up very far apart, then one domino randomly tipping over only releases a tiny amount of kinetic energy and isn't likely to knock any others over.  This is where the natural independent ""radioactive decay"" idea comes into play, and is how ""half-life"" is defined.

On the other hand, if there are very many dominoes standing next to each other, then one domino tipping over might push two others, which might push into four others, with might push into eight others, etc.  All of these dominoes (except the very first one) didn't ""decay"" naturally, they were all pushed!  So, the amount of fallen dominoes is more a question of ""How closely packed are the dominoes?"" and ""How long on average does a chain-reaction of domino falls last?"" rather than a question of isolated ""half-life"".

They're kind of unstable so there is a chance of them just going ""poof"" and decaying. Half-life is the time it takes for half of the atoms in any given amount of material to undergo this spontaneous decay.

However, in a reactor we've arranged it so that there is a pretty big chance that when one atom decays the neutron (small sub-atomic particle) shoots out and hits another atom, which will cause that atom to split and shoot off more neutrons, which will hit other particles and cause a cascade effect. Compare it to just shooting a billiard ball on a pool table randomly vs stacking the balls into a pyramid (shooting a ball into that pyramid will cause a whole bunch of other balls to move around).

That effect is used in a reactor, because when a whole bunch of little atoms decay quickly they release heat. In our normal powerplants they're stacked so that it happens very quickly (although our current generation is kind of inefficient and only a small percentage of the fuel is used up before the effect slows down or becomes too difficult to handle due to dangerous byproducts), and that generates a lot of heat which is used to heat water into steam and drive a steam turbine.

There is also something called a radioisotope thermoelectric generator, a nuclear battery of sorts. Basically a radioactive element that has been arranged to encourage it to just react a little bit faster. Not cascade, just generate enough heat that it can be used to generate power through the thermoelectric effect. Those batteries last a lot longer, so they're used on deep space satellites like Voyager (that travel far enough away from the sun that solar panels aren't useful anymore). Voyagers nuclear battery produced something like 60% of its original power back in 2001 (some 25 years after its launch) but theoretically a battery like this could be designed to last thousands of years."	2	0

The neutrons that come from out of the fissioning heavy atoms are going way too fast. The neutrons aren't blasting into the other atoms so much as merging with them and causing them to become unstable. If the neutrons are going too fast, they just bounce off and nothing happens.

Yes, putting fuel pellets close to each other increases the odds that the neutrons will bounce around, slow down, and then cause another atom to split. However, unless you just put a *lot* together, that won't happen - at least, not at a rate that maintains the chain reaction. 

Nuclear bombs get around this by using conventional high explosives to compress the nuclear fuel while also setting off another nuclear fuel with a *much* lower half-life that spits out a *huge* number of neutrons. Enough neutrons are released and the nuclear fuel has been compressed enough that even with a pretty low chance of the neutrons causing more atoms to split, enough of them split anyway and *boom*.

Nuclear power plants use a *moderator* like water, which slows the neutrons down without (hopefully) absorbing too many of them. The pellets are separated by the moderator so that as a few atoms naturally fission the neutrons are slowed down by the moderator. When they get to the other fuel pellets, the neutrons are going slow enough to have a high chance of interacting and causing more fission - releasing more neutrons, etc. The process is controlled by controlling how much of the fuel is exposed to the moderator and other fuel pellets, and by controlling ""shields"" made out of a material (like boron) that absorbs the neutrons without doing anything, blocking the chain reaction."	3	0

So would being on birth control for a long time just mean there were more eggs to get rid of at menopause?

No.  The body will double down by releasing *all* of the eggs that were ready to be released the next time a woman has a period OR they'll be absorbed by the immune system and disposed of through those processes.

So...here's the thing...eggs - and I hate to use this term, but it's the best way to think about it - get ""ripe"".  And, usually only one gets ripe at a time.  If an egg is ripe and it isn't released from the ovary, it dies.  If it's dead, it can be released when the next ripe egg is released (and usually will be - unless there's intervention, like ovulation limiting hormones).  If that happens, it's flushed with an unfertilized eggs during the next period.  If it's not, it gets absorbed by the uterine wall and flushed into the immune or excretory systems.

&gt;Re: sperm, what are those normal bodily processes

I'm not 100% certain, but I believe it's immune response, then excretory system response.  Dead cell removal and all that, meaning that eventually they dead husks will either be flushed with natural lubrication, urination, excretion, or sweat (and almost certainly not sweat)."	2	0

They avoid it most cases because, think about it, there’s no much emergency types where you desperately need that. If you can control the plane you can fly and burn it in the engines. If you don’t control the plane you dead. the most likely reason you need to dump and land is a medical emergency on board I guess, other than that, I can’t see another scenario where it’s that important to land ASAP. If you can fly the plane you can wait the fuel to be burned.

This said, If you really have to dump it, you dump it. It will affect people on the ground if you do it at low altitude, but the inconvenience is not as bad as letting someone die.

Fuel is cancerous, toxic and pollutant. But the amount you spray is not going to one-shot everyone on the ground. You give some eye irritation and bad smell to everyone, this in the absolute worse case. 

Me and colleagues had, at least once, got a real fuel shower. Soaked wet from head to toes. It sucks, but it won’t hurt you in a significant way if it happens once in lifetime. The eyes are the worse part. You have to rinse them with fresh water for very long, and still, eyes may hurt for maybe a week. Ingested fuel makes your stomach sensitive and you burp with fuel smell for some days. Again it sucks but that’s the effect of being splashed by 50 liters of kerosene directly. Do this daily and you will surely die young, but once in a lifetime won’t change your odds. You breathe fuel every time you walk in a city. That will short your life expectancy a bit, because it’s a continuous exposure.

Compare this with a plane jettison and the plane jettison is negligible as long as it is done for emergency only.

The environmental effect is probably the worse part of it."	12	0

In the medium-size helicopter I used the fly, fuel was ~25% of takeoff weight, and at that size, the fuel dump pumps can evacuate it from the aircraft rapidly.  Being able to drop that much weight quickly is invaluable in a difficult engine out scenario.

As just an example, we regularly hovered at 70 feet over the ocean.  Although occasionally possible, it is rare to have enough wind/power to continue a hover single engine.  The more likely scenario is that the aircraft descends as the pilot pulls as much power out of the good engine, and then the aircraft settles into a very low hover over the water where the additional ground effect from being so close to the water knocks a smidge off the power required.  Assuming the non flying pilot turned on the dump switch as soon as the engine failed, it is possible with in a few minutes with enough fuel dumped that the pilot could fly the aircraft away from the water and limp home on a single engine.  Since the power required decreases considerably as the aircraft speeds up from a hover, it is a reasonable scenario as long as the aircraft survives the initial drop and doesn't get more than the wheels wet."	2	0

I worked on some. I’m not a pilot so my guess is do a catA recovery and try to get some horizontal speed to decrease your power requirement. Still… sounds scary and my guess is you may cut the hoist cable or ask the crew to jump out (lol), but jettisoning in those split seconds would be quite impractical for crew workload, and still would pump too slow and too late. But… vipers are all very different one from another. Doing that for some heli is basically a floatation equipment live test.	1	0

Unless there is a rare uncontrollable fire it should be totally fine to calmly burn fuel. Fuel dumping is normally required for failures that cause imminent risk to the airplane, such as smoke in the cabin or some control issues. 

To complement what others said, fuel vaporises easier at higher temperatures, therefore fuel should be jetissoned ideally at not too high altitudes."	3	0

You can, however, keep your US number and use roaming, but this could be pretty expensive depending on your carrier. Skype numbers are a solution that allows you to have a functioning US number that is very cheap because you're only charged when you actually use it - I think google voice is similar.

It might make more sense to just get a local number and transfer your various verification codes over to the new number.

Goods being bought and taken directly out of the local economy are not a part of the local competitive system.

Pre-Brexit however, there was no duty free on goods within the EU, so the Coquelles store was usually more expensive than just visiting Auchan in Calais. 

I would usually just buy all the wine and beer I wanted at Auchan (lots of varieties that weren’t available in the UK) and just offload my last couple of Euros at Coquelles. 

These days, the UK is outside the EU, so goods can now be sold at Coquelles free of VAT though there is now a limit of how much you can import free of duty."	3	0

It's literally not worth their time. If they wanted something that they could buy at an airport, they'd already have it .. and they aren't going to suddenly decide they want it at the airport.

The only people who buy expensive shit like Louis Vuitton and Rolex at duty free are the ones who have enough money to buy them, but not enough to do it without being concerned about saving the tax on it. All of these premium brands are status symbols, there is no reason to buy them over alternatives other than to show off your wealth. To show off your wealth by buying something duty free immediately indicates that you do not ACTUALLY have as much wealth as you're trying to flaunt.

Middle to upper working class people are the target market. Well off, but not who I'd group in with those I'd consider ""wealthy"".

Bear in mind also that there's no VAT charged on exports.

Contrast this to Tobacco where there can be a serious saving (e.g. £8.50ish for 50g compared to almost £30 in the shops) and you could imagine how cheap it could be, if they passed all of the duty and VAT savings on (+ of course they still make a profit on the Tobacco...they are not a charity, after all)."	1	0

The big selling point was that it provided a market of people who otherwise would not have spent a penny in Ireland and who (for tax purposes) had not ever been there. The Irish govt could afford to waive the lost excise duty on booze sales against the gain to local industry in net profits, and they negotiated an agreement with the US govt. not to hit passengers with a couple of bottles of whiskey in return for reduced landing fees.

Oddly enough, nothing in them is cheap compared to buying it from the store with the taxes included. I recall going to a store and seeing the booze and price checking it, it was either the same price or more expensive. Of course there are also sales in those stores but that doesn't count.

They don't arrive at a passenger terminal gate, but they absolutely do arrive at international airports (as defined by the legislation in your country) - the law binds them to this.

What do you think drug runners would do? International flights between private airstrips - which is exactly why it is illegal, so that customs, immigration and quarantine can ALL inspect the plane and people in one place.

They MAY arrive somewhere other than an international airport with permission from Customs, Immigration AND Quarantine .. all 3 need to be applied to individually and all 3 need to grant permission individually under their own legislation. I can tell you from personal experience that there needs to be a pretty compelling reason for this permission to be granted, it's absolutely not routine because it's a giant pain in the arse to organise and comes at a cost to the taxpayer.

Even so, arguing that international aircraft can land wherever they feel like it only supports my argument that people who are private jet wealthy are not the ones buying duty free."	3	0

There are big ones, and there are small ones. You are correct in saying they may arrive at another gazetted international airport - which may not always be main commercial airport, but a lot of them still do arrive at the main international airports.

Most airports are shared by many companies, not only passenger transport but also freight and private charter companies. It is usually the charter companies who are paid to all the paperwork and receive the private jets into their hangers.

Most don't stay there though. They land, get internationally cleared and depart again - once they are cleared they are free to fly domestically where they wish and this includes flying to a private airstrip.

The same on the way out. They fly domesticaly to a gazetted international airport to be cleared outbound, and they leave from there."	2	0

Ataturk, Turkey's founding father, wanted Turkey to be a modern western society so for a really long time there were government rules designed to make Turks drop many of the conservative Islamic traditions in favor of ""modern"" secular norms. 

While the religious folks have had their way with things in recent years, Turkey is still very much a secular society where the rules of Islam aren't the governing law. In this sense, while there are still moral and cultural norms based in Islam, Turkish society (in the major cities at least) looks far more ""European"" than Qatar or Saudi Arabia do. 

There are liquor stores that sell booze, large breweries making beer, etc. within the country. So it wouldn't make a ton of sense to have strict rules when you want to bring a few bottles of booze with you on the way in."	5	0

This is why it's common to see items like alcohol/tobacco where excise taxes can make up a substantial percentage of the price.  Again, these are for immediate export and are often sealed and delivered to you on the plane instead of provided immediately after purchase.

Last note, they aren't only seen at airports.  Any border crossing can have one, for example the crossing in Niagara Falls between the US and Canada has (or at least had, can't be sure it's still there) one.

**Edit to add:**  Most countries have laws around importing products in this manner.  If you bring more than what would reasonably be deemed for personal use you may have to pay fines and/or taxes at your arriving country.  In the case of tobacco or alcohol anything past 2 cartons or a couple bottles would usually not be considered for personal use."	3	0

Do you actually know anything about duty free shops? In terms of spirits, they carry 50-year-old single malts and cognacs for $30-50k that cannot be purchased anywhere else. These products are called ""travel retail exclusives"" (of course, not all of them are that expensive), and there is a huge market for this, especially in major internal hubs. Exclusive products (exclusivity being a major draw to high net worth individuals who like to spend money) are a huge part of duty free."	1	0

Think about how stick drift is so common with controllers today - and that’s just for a single person. 

In the heyday of arcades, arcade quality parts were generally all imported through specialist repair companies and lead time was generally pretty long. These days though shipping is dramatically shorter, both parts and repairmen are in short supply as the industry has dramatically contracted since the 80s.

Arcades alone have never really been profitable on games. By the time you’d amortize the cost of machine and maintenance, the machine was likely no longer new and popular and thus would just take up room in the arcade without generating significant new revenue. They’ve always relied on stuff like food/drink and higher margin machines likes claw machines for the actual revenue stream."	6	0

Arcades themselves were a big hit, but individual games might only sell a single game to certain arcades so only the biggest games, think like Pac-man, and Galaga, Street Figther, Mortal Combat, and such were made in really large quantities and for a long time. Most other games could be their own unique boards and systems and screens made in very low quantities, or hopefully a game that could have common parts with many other games and maybe you only needed to change out a piece or two of hardware and the logo on the outside of the machine. It was all over the place.

This meant that things like spare parts or even know-how to fix games that were broken, or needed updates or any number of things just were not hotly available, even game models changed a lot, so new and old spare parts on the same game may have changed.... which gets to another very very important thing

Arcade games were generally rented not owned, even large arcades would often rent their games and service on them from people who, well, would buy arcade machines, and rent them out including servicing them.

Read that again--- mostly, arcade business was a RENTAL business. You rented the game.  You may split the revenue with the company that owns the machine, or just pay a rental fee. Of course if you're splitting it with the company, they want their machines working but you don't care that much if a single machine is dead, its not costing you much to leave it there. If you're renting the machine, well you gotta try to get it repaired or get something else and work it out with the owner. (Just to be clear, you could buy arcade games, but most arcades were small businesses and that wasn't really viable)

When a game broke, you'd have to get your service person out (and they were busy!), hope they had spare parts for it, which they may not, hope they even knew how to fix that game, and more. Hell maybe its not getting fixed, maybe you don't wanna pay for it to get fixed, maybe you'd just want a new or different game instead, but all of this was not fast as the techs and services that did arcades were local and small, and most arcades were small business, and not great ones. The margins on arcade games, since they are rented and expensive is pretty low.  Selling shitty pizza and soda to arcade goers is a good margin though

Games get beat up and often were poorly maintained, if maintained at all."	2	0

Biochemical Oxygen Demand is how much of the dissolved oxygen in the water is used up in either chemical reactions, or by biological things like fish or microbes.

Dumping a lot of organic waste into water causes the microbes that decompose that waste to skyrocket in numbers, and those billions and billions of microbes consume oxygen too. So by dumping organic waste into water you deplete the oxygen in the water through all the decomposition that is happening.

Less oxygen in the water means animals like fish die from lack of oxygen, essentially suffocating in the water."	1	0

However wouldn't ocean tides naturally dilute the waste over time and lower B.O.D., or is it simply just not fast enough compared to how much waste a typical city might produce?

Wastewater treatment is sort of a giant multi step beer brewing operation.

Long ago it was a bucket, the newest aircraft carriers have massive poo and food blenders to break everything down before they spray it out behind them, but it has happened since we first took to the seas for more than a few hours.

In addition to the ""BOD"" problem above, our waste has increasingly large amounts of other stuff in it. Viruses from sick people and disposed animals, pharmaceuticals, industrial waste that finds it's way into sewage, chemicals from hand soap to paint to anything else you can think of.

It's actually better to just compost it. Which is what we do. Because sewage systems have to have concentration points for machinery, we collect it there, remove a lot of water, and put it into digestion ponds where the bacteria in the water do exactly what you are wanting them to do here. Once it's been digested, we spread it out on the ground where it turns back into dirt. Most cities actually turn around and sell it to farmers and home gardeners. Search '<city> waste water' and you will find these locations hidden all over. You can probably find your own poo for sale at your local Home Depot or Lowes. When I lived in Austin it was called Dillo Dirt.

Or, if you are rural, your septic tank basically does this.

Alternatively, in many places, we just directly apply it to the ground without dewatering or digesting it. There are EPA limits on how much you can do this. Then it gets sucked up by the ground, we plant corn on top of it, and then you know, corn. Or soybeans. W/e, you get the idea.

Or, unfortunately, we just landfill it. This should also now qualify as an ELI5 'forever chemicals.'

For starters even if wastewater is just human excrement, if it is straight up dumped into the ocean, this creates a huge saturation of waste. It's one thing for the millions of fish spread across the oceans to relieve themselves in the water, and another to have a pipe dumping thousands of gallons of human waste into one specific spot. Yes it eventually disperses and there's currents and all that but the water is over saturated with waste, so whatever life was in that coast is gone if untreated waste water is just dumped there. 

Secondly waste water is not just our human waste. All sorts of things end up there, some of which are supposed to end up there and many that aren't supposed to but do anyways. A lot of people are on medication or consuming other substances that end up in their waste, which can contaminate marine biomes and affect life there. Then there's all sorts of different chemicals from the soaps and cosmetics we use when we take baths to oil and gas and filth washed off the streets and ending up in drains, to illegal dumping of waste into toilets or drains because people can't be assed to dispose of them properly. This makes waste water highly toxic and damaging to any environment."	1	0

I’m a marine biologist who monitors exactly what you are asking for coastal California. We dump a lot of our waste offshore and the outfall pipe is setup and a depth and distance that dilution should occur. But that’s where we come in, ensuring this is operating as expected and not exacerbated by all of our other ocean climate issues like fertilizer runoff, warming, acidification, harmful algae blooms, etc.

The principal metric we monitor is bacterial growth. E. coli specifically. The fear is that concentrated amounts of waste lead to overgrowth of bacteria that cause human sickness. And this happens often if the waste processing plant breaks down or the pipe leaks or a massive runoff event.

In the case of coastal outfalls, they are at too shallow of a depth to export this carbon permanently. It has to be the deep open ocean, and even then the experiments trying to do this found that the physical oceanography (currents etc) did not support fast enough sinking rates to remove he carbon before bacteria fed on the plankton and respired the co2 right back.

Kelp floats are the new approach, on a weighted buoy system that sinks once the kelp reach a heavy enough biomass. This sinks far faster and has carbon capture potential but the issue is scale. It’s hard to create the same footprint with cultured kelp as a widespread phytoplankton bloom"	1	0

Here is the real EL5

Four issues caused by wastewater.

1. Human waste is a good fertilizer.  Those nutrients, if not treated properly, get into the water and cause things like algae to grow faster.  Blue green algae tend to be toxic (cyanotoxins) and block sunlight from reach rooted plants on the at the bottom of the water body.

2.  The same chemicals and bacteria tend to use up (react) the dissolved oxygen. Thus depleting oxygen that fishes and other creatures need to breathe.

3.  In the case of industrial pollution, that is where you find toxins, both small-scale poisions and long scale toxins that concentrate in the food chain (bioaccumulation/biomagnification) that have either dramatic effects like fish kills, or long term effects like carcinogens and/or poisioning over time.

4.  All the previous 3 factors can change the environment to favor or inhibit one species over another, reducing the diversity of the ecosystem and food chain."	1	0

Aside from our bodily fluids you have, heavy metals, microplastics, and excreted pharmaceuticals. Additionally your wastewater isn't just what's in the toilet. Grease and pathogens from kitchens, washing machines, showers etc also go down the same drain. Any cleaning chemical you put also down the drain.

Pharmaceutical contamination is a major player as well. For example, there was a study that found that the birth control pill caused the feminisation of fish in a lake. If all the fish are female then that's going to cause a decrease in populations.

Everyone is aware of microplastic pollution but they can also act as vectors for pharmaceuticals where drugs will adsorb onto the surface then desorb in gastro intestinal tract of organisms. This can also happen with heavy metals.

Basically, there's more to your wastewater than urine and faecal matter and it's causing a detrimental effect on the environment. It's also very extensive and complicated. Wastewater treatment plants do their best at treating wastewater before it reaches the final effluent point, but ultimately they aren't built for removing contaminants such as microplastics or pharmaceuticals.

Like you said if a large amount of waste is discharged into the ocean it will increase the B.O.D will deplete the oxygen in the water thus causing aquatic life in the water will suffocate and die due to lack of oxygen. This is a serious problem that can have a devastating effect on the marine ecosystem and the ecological balance for humans as well as other organisms can be disrupted. However, there are still many ways to reduce the amount of waste that ends up in the oceans. But such measures often take a long time. It is true that by taking measures we can help protect the oceans and the marine life that depends on them. But do you think that maintaining them in such a way that takes a long time will help the marine life that has already been harmed by the waste water?	1	0

Build a pipeline to a refinery ($$$) or build holding tanks and then truck it there ($$). Build a crude refinery (a large modern plant costs $10 billion+, but let's say you're making a small one, so it'll be in the range of $20-200 million). Staff your new refinery 24/7.

There is some friction, since prices can go up at any time while wages tend to go up when people change jobs or annual raise cycles, but it eventually works out.

Lowering prices would cause the same friction, as companies would likely lower pay immediately before all goods and services can see their prices lowered. And who dictates how much to lower? What if a company is STILL just breaking even at the higher price, can they be mandated to take a loss? 

And another BIG factor is debt expenses. With inflation and the subsequent pay increases, your mortgage gets cheaper over time. Your car payment feels smaller over time. But if you cut people's pay while those historic purchases and subsequent repayments are the same then it would become a bigger burden on their monthly budget. Their $2000 mortgage is manageable on an $8000/mo income. If that gets cut to $6500, then they can't afford their house anymore.

We can! We don't have to spend money at all! But that leaves basically two options: Inefficiency or inhumanity.

Money is a symbol of value which can be exchanged between people. We don't *need* to use money to exchange value, we can just directly exchange things of value. This is called ""barter"" and it is very inefficient; if for example you have chickens and want to buy a dress, you need to find someone with a dress who wants chickens. If that isn't readily available then you need to find some crazy link, like trading chickens for butter, butter for nails, nails for making a fence, and a dressmaker who needs a new fence. That is a huge pain and impractical in a larger economy so it is much easier to use a generic voucher for value, which is money.

The other option to avoid paying for stuff is to just force people to do things. Most people show up to work because they are being paid, but we could just *make* them work without pay. Then everything is free because no money is needed. Of course this is called ""slavery"" and it is generally considered cruel and inhumane.

So things like antimatter costing millions is because it is how much value is needed to make people voluntarily do all the things required to produce antimatter. If you don't pay that money then you need some way to get those people to do those things, either without using money (barter) or by not exchanging appropriate value (slavery)."	1	0

There are problems that occur before the prices even out. For example, if you suddenly raised the price of everything 10x, eventually people make 10x more money, but until all the wages, contracts, labels, etc are readjusted, no one can afford anything, people will not be able to eat, pay rent, get gas, etc. Likewise if you lower prices too much, a small number of people will buy everything up and people also won't be able to get houses, food, gas etc."	1	0

Instead, when we make statements about the ""price"" of antimatter, they're extrapolations based on the cost of all the machines, materials, and expertise that are required to make it. 

Simply passing a law that says ""Nuh uh, those things actually don't cost that much"" won't change the amount of time, effort, and materials that it takes to make a supercollider or get a PhD in physics.

You also have to factor in Supply and Demand. High demand and low supply translates to higher product costs, while low demand and high supply translates to lower product costs. So the easiest way to lower costs of a product is to make more of it.

If you pass a law that a product must be sold for a certain value than the difference of that cost must come from somewhere.

If it cost millions to create the equipment and process the fuel to make anti-matter than those that make it must recoup their cost. If they are required to sell it at a lower cost, they will just lose money and therefore won't make any at all.

Subside is the answer to this in the West, where the Government will spend tax dollars to help companies and organizations with the cost of making these products in exchange for lower rates to consumers.

This can often mean covering the costs of things like research, building infrastructure, etc to lower the costs.

Also the more of something you make, generally the lower the cost because there is less demand and the product becomes easier to make.

Controlling the costs of things directly is a planned economy, which is what the Soviet Union did. In a planned economy you can enforce the cost of a glass of milk is 1 Copek (1 penny) but then the government must absorb the costs if it costs more than 1 Copek to make that glass of milk."	1	0

If you've heard of people who sell a super-rare comic book for a million dollars, you can only get that if there's a guy out there who already has a million bucks, and he wants your comic book more than that money.  If Mr. Big Spender isn't around, then your comic book isn't worth a million dollars.

The prices of things are determined by *supply* and *demand*.  How much stuff is being produced?  How many people want it?  If you have a factory that produces a million little gadgets a day, do you have a million buyers out there who want those gadgets?  A million new buyers every day?  If you have too much supply, then prices go down.  You could have a warehouse with 50,000 copies of Roseanne Barr's sex tape, but nobody wants to buy that.  You basically can't give it away.  It has no value.  

On the other hand, a giant mansion on a beautiful beach *is* valuable.  There are a lot of people who want that.  In fact, there are more people in the world who want beach mansions than there are beach mansions total.  As a result, the value is high.  People bid against one another to be one of the people who gets a beach mansion.  And people are willing to spend more and more money to get one of those.  If that other guy is willing to give you $100 for a beach mansion, then I am willing to give you $150.  Of course, somebody else is willing to give you $10 million, and he outbids us both.  So beach mansions have a lot of value.

The actual numbers that are printed on the money don't really matter.  You can add or subtract zeroes, but it doesn't change how much people desire the stuff.  It also doesn't change the amount of stuff available.  Money is just a stand-in for stuff, because it's easier to write a check or carry around pieces of paper than it is to lug around six goats, 12 baskets of fruit, and five rickets of wood."	1	0

If the government says the stores can't sell a gallon of milk for more than $0.50, then they're not going to pay the farmers more than $0.25 a gallon. They still have their own costs and employees to pay. Well, that's not what milk costs to produce, so farmers aren't going to bother raising cattle anymore as it's a loss of money.

But the government doesn't want milk to disappear, they just want to curb consumer inflation by imposing restrictions on what it can be sold for at mass market. So they create a stipend for cattle ranchers to sell their milk to grocers at $0.25 a gallon, and the government will pay them an incentive in some form. This could be in the form of reduced tax liability, yearly return, or direct payout. How much the farmers should be compensated would be a complicated matter.

But as pointed out, capitalism is all about opportunity cost, so scalpers are just going to buyout all the milk and resell it at a higher price. The problem here for the scalpers, however, is that most people aren't going to go black market to buy something simple like milk so the scalpers have two problems: What they are doing is big jail time illegal so they are taking a big risk, and they can't mass-market their business model like a grocery store can. The government could curb the scalping by imposing restrictions around sale quantity limits and tracking producers and buyers.

The question of whether the government should do this kind of thing, then, is mostly political. In this example the cost of the milk hasn't actually gone down, its just now regulated at the end-point and passing most of the cost to the upper class (If they're paying their fair share of the taxes. Many of the inflation problems in the US are directly tied to the fact that the upper band of tax payers aren't paying their fair share). There's a long history of governments failing with half-measures and poor regulation, so this kind of social policy has a high chance of causing more harm than good if not fully thought-out or implemented properly.

If you ask, why doesn't the government do this already? In many cases, especially food and water, it already does! For example, [farmers in Arizona are compensated for the extra cost of growing crops in a dry and arid environment](https://answerconnect.cch.com/document/jaz0109013e2c84f53d03/state/explanations/arizona/environmental-credits-agricultural-water-conservation-system). Arizona does this to reduce the cost of produce at the grocery store, otherwise, the cost of food would drive their population out to other states."	1	0

The actual hard price of what it costs to produce something can be difficult to quantify. If a farmer grows 10,000 ears of corn, but loses 5% of the yield due to various factors, should the grocery store still have to pay the cost of all 10,000? Well yes, because otherwise the farmer can't continue to grow corn. Plus he's going to charge extra for the time and labor, because human time has value as well. He's also going to charge for the cost of the machinery to plant, water, and harvest the corn. Even further, he might charge a little on top of that so that he feed his family during the winter when the crops aren't growing.

To answer the question ""if antimatter costs millions, why can't we just make it cost less?"", I will ask you a question in return: If antimatter is so costly, why don't you just make your own and sell it for less?

The answer to my question, then, is the reason why it costs millions. You would need multiple scientists with PhD's in quantum mechanics and physics. You would need large and expensive machinery and electronics, large amounts of electricity (amounts that would affect the entire country's electrical grid), and the staff that knows, supports, and maintains that machinery. Then, you need to find someone willing to buy your antimatter and provide it to them.

At the end of all of that, you'll find that it cost you millions to make that antimatter."	1	0

There are many varieties of jammers. The simplest is to just broadcast a \*really\* powerful signal on the same frequency the recipient is trying to listen on. This is like shining a flashlight in the eyes of someone trying to look at the stars...all they can see is your signal and they can't see anything else. Crude, but effective. 

More sophisticated is to try to broadcast something that interferes with the true signal...this doesn't take as much power but requires more knowledge of the target signal, how it's modulated, etc., etc. 

Really really fancy is to try to nefariously alter the true signal...the recipient gets what looks like a good signal, only it's wrong, and they don't realize it. Now we're blurring into hacking. That takes serious foreknowledge and realtime processing power.

Jammers ""know"" what frequency to broadcast on by looking at the signal they're trying to jam. That might be known in advance or might be determined real time. Any sophisticated jammer is really a very powerful transmitter coupled to an equally fancy receiver & signal analyzer."	1	0

its the same basic principle. the message is lost in the ""noise"" of your jamming. It really does boil down to a loudness war.

&#x200B;

as to ""how do i know what frequency to jam"", theirs a few ways:

&#x200B;

1) just blanket large areas of the spectrum with jamming, which spreads your jammers power over a wide band, so its less effective. you counter it by just putting more power into your chosen band than them.

2) use a listening device to see what frequencies are in use and just jam those. More focused effect, but can be countered by frequency hopping.

When you freeze something normally, ice crystals form. Ice crystals are larger than liquid water, so it blows the cells apart from the inside. (Fun experiment to prove this: Freeze then thaw a carrot and compare how it reacts when hit to a carrot that's never been frozen.)

Vitrification frozen water retains the same structure and size as liquid water, so it doesn't expand and damage the cells.

One key aspect of this transition is the sleep-wake cycle, regulated by the circadian rhythm, a natural, internal process that regulates the sleep-wake cycle and repeats roughly every 24 hours. When you are asleep, your body goes through different stages of sleep, including light sleep, deep sleep, and REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. Waking up during a deep sleep stage can contribute to that groggy feeling, as your body and brain are not in an optimal state for immediate alertness.  
Another factor is the sleep inertia, which is the groggy feeling or temporary impairment of cognitive performance that many people experience after waking up. Sleep inertia can last for a few minutes to around 30 minutes. During this period, your brain gradually transitions from a sleep state to a wakeful state. It takes time for the brain to fully activate its cognitive functions, such as attention, memory, and reaction time.  
Additionally, the hormone cortisol plays a role in the wake-up process. Cortisol is often referred to as the ""stress hormone,"" but it also has a natural circadian rhythm. Cortisol levels typically rise in the early morning to help you wake up and feel alert. The gradual increase in cortisol levels assists in resetting the body's internal clock and promoting wakefulness.  
The grogginess upon waking can also be influenced by external factors, such as the quality and duration of your sleep. If you haven't had enough restorative sleep or if your sleep has been disrupted, it can contribute to that sluggish feeling upon waking.  
To mitigate the dozy feeling in the morning, establishing a consistent sleep routine, ensuring a sufficient amount of sleep, and allowing some time for your body and brain to adjust upon waking can be helpful. Exposure to natural light in the morning and avoiding stimulating activities close to bedtime can also positively influence your wake-up experience by aligning with the natural circadian rhythm."	1	0

The best photorealistic CG people we can come up with were probably the dead actors brought back to life to play Tarkin and young Leia in the Star Wars sequels. They were good, but even not knowing those actors were dead, they looked just a tiny bit off.

If a CG artist goes for a deliberately abstracted/stylized look, not only does that give them more freedom in terms of aesthetics, but it doesn't even attempt to cross the uncanny valley.

The reason that full CG is limited to kids' movies for the most part is asking about human motivation-- the suits decided that's who would see the movie, so that's what they do. But there is room for adult animation as well, and it is sure to grow as animation gets easier and cheaper."	14	0

Photorealistic 3D animations are expensive and require a ton of skill to animate without looking unsettling. Besides, why would you need to animate photorealistic characters when you can film real people and use CGI to position them? Animation offers more freedom to stylize your characters and settings. Most times when someone does photorealistic 3D animation, it is purely to flex their ability to do so, rather than because it's useful to production. 


> And why is it all for kids i want to see warriors with long flowing hair fighting monsters and steampunk war lords having a interdimensinal dj battle. And cute girls with neon dyed hair.


Have you heard of [Love, Death & Robots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love,_Death_%26_Robots)? It sounds pretty up your alley, though I'll warn you that it's pretty graphic if that's not your style. There's a ton of adult 3D animated media out there."	10	0

If you want photorealistic dude the amount of hours of rendering goes up significantly. Like if you want photorealistic hair you need photorealistic clothes. if you have photo realistic clothes and hair then you want photo realistic skin textures, eyes that do not look dead, animations that are realistic... If you want photo realism you have to add a huge abundance of things to make everything photo realistic because you cannot do it by just making one thing photo realistic. If you make one thing photorealistic all things need to be photorealistic to make what you are producing photorealistic

&#x200B;

This all comes at a huge expense in computational power... what your CPU and GPU can do

&#x200B;

Any animator for any projects could easily do all of the things you want as  photo realistic animation if what the end product is stick men in a 2d world.  Its not really difficult to animate anything if all you have is the skeleton that you need to put in different positions and apply some physics

&#x200B;

Its estimated Rise of The Guardians might of took 65million hours to render

&#x200B;

Most cannot afford that, so they go for a system that is visually appealing and is cheaper to render"	1	0

Light penetrates a little bit into skin, bounces around, and then comes back out. Translucency is *extremely* demanding to render because the computer not only has to calculate where the light is coming from, its intensity, the angle that it will hit the skin, the angle it bounces off, and then every other surface it will hit before it reaches the camera...it also has to calculate all of that happening inside skin layers, multiple times over.

Additionally, skin is very textured. Every single little crack and fold is an additional polygon that the computer has to calculate. Skin has to stretch and move in complex ways, and each extra bit of texture is another way that the skin can move. It also changes how light interacts with that skin, complicating the calculations for that light even more.

We notice those things most with human skin because we're so familiar with it and have evolved to pay attention to it. But it's true for *all* surfaces. Many things are partially translucent. Wood tends to have a layer of clear or mostly clear finish, paints require multiple layers to completely cover what's underneath, and of course glass and actual plastic can be all kinds of colors and levels of transparency. All of them have different kinds of texture.

Some human being has to sit down and design each surface, carefully sculpting the texture and programming how light should interact with it. That takes time. Studios likely have a library of textures and options, but it costs time and money to develop that library, and smaller studios have to purchase those assets. For low-budget productions, they just don't have the money to pay someone to put that much effort in, or to purchase them from asset libraries. They end up using default, smooth textures with little or no transparency, which ends up looking plasticky.

And of course, even if someone has access to those kinds of textures and transparency settings, that increases the processing required to render each frame. It increases the odds that something goes funky and that means someone has to manually edit the frame or the settings and render it again. Rendering takes time and electricity, both of which cost money - both literally, because you need to buy or rent computers and the power to run them, but also it increases turnaround time. Low-budget productions usually have a much faster turnaround time, needing to crank out episodes in short order.

A television show might have a great budget, but because there are many more hours of video than a typical movie, there are many more frames that need to get rendered. Each frame is money, and that means the budget has to get stretched further, so again there just isn't enough money for better quality texture and lighting."	6	0

It isn't that they don't protect you *at all*, but that the benefits are much greater for someone who is infected instead of someone who is not.

The main way that someone who is infected will spread their infection to others is through coughing out droplets of virus-laden fluids. A mask over their face reduces this spray of droplets and helps to prevent them infecting others. In contrast someone who is uninfected is more likely to become infected by touching a contaminated surface and carrying it into their body that way than simply breathing in airborne viruses. If an infected person coughed in their face the mask isn't going to help much since their eyes and the rest of their face are exposed.

So the reason flipping the mask around doesn't help is because the benefits don't depend on the order of the layers but rather the overarching concept of their use. Putting a mask over the main method an infected person expels infected material is really helpful. Putting a mask over only one of the many ways an uninfected person could get infected is much less helpful."	9	0

Wearing a mask prevents coughing and sneezing from spreading virus particles 10 feet randomly into the air. Hence, this keeps the transmission through tiny air droplets low.

Flipping a mask around does nothing but flip it around, lol. Standard surgical masks are not designed to seal or block out particulate. So, however you orient it will not make a big difference as long as it’s on your face, snugly covering your nose and mouth."	4	0

The first and third layers are often the same material (spun bound polypropylene). The middle layer is meltblown polypropylene. The middle layer has an electrostatic charge and is the best at filtering particulate. The inner layer may be a different grade or type of spunbound polypropylene because it's the one that touches your skin, so it's important for it to be non-irritating. The outer layer may have a different thickness or other properties, because passing a test where a pressurized squirt of synthetic blood is shot at the mask is one of the regulatory requirements.

For how well it filters particulate and how breathable it is, it doesn't matter if you wear it backwards. It'll work the same."	1	0
