The President briefly talked about punishing women for abortion &amp; when everyone rightly freaked out, he recanted. But I think his remarks showed his inner thought process. [&lt;Source&gt;](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/31/us/politics/donald-trump-abortion.html). 

In addition, Republican representatives have often called for the punishment of women, in addition to their doctors, for abortion. 

An ID rep. called for their execution, but then similarly walked it back. [&lt;Source&gt;](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/apr/3/bob-nonini-idaho-gop-candidate-suggests-punishment/)

Another ID rep. tried to introduce legislation that would charge women for 1st degree murder just last year [&lt;Source&gt;](http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/fetal-homicide-state-laws.aspx).

A number of OH representatives have introduced a bill that, while currently under revision, would currently criminally punish women &amp; doctors with the same crime [&lt;Source&gt;](https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/legislation-summary?id=GA132-HB-565).

I would posit that the politicians who say that they would not punish a women for an abortion, but only punish their doctor, are playing a politically expedient game. It is the reason they ""accidentally"" tell the truth &amp; then have to walk it back. The party's actions as a whole in other avenues of this question seem to show that they would change their hand if the political wind blew differently, or if they had more power. 

Indeed, since Planned Parenthood v. Casey sets the state's right to ban abortion at ""viability of the fetus,"" and due to advancements in medical science, viability is therefore a moving target that is always waxing backward (from 24 weeks at the start of the millennia to around 20 weeks now). Because of this women are being prosecuted as we speak [&lt;Source&gt;](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/indiana-has-now-charged-two-asian-american-women-feticide-n332761) &amp; that is likely to continue &amp; increase. 

Furthermore, pro-life individuals often frame the argument as one of a binary choice between if a fetus is a ""human life"" or not (ignoring the spectrum of viability in Planned Parenthood v. Casey). This is almost always to focus the argument in such a way to quantify ""abortion as murder."" The logical conclusion to that construction of thought is that murderers should be punished. This is a shocking, but logically consistent framework for those self-identifying as ""pro-life"" &amp; is likely the reason why their representatives do what they do &amp; will likely punish women &amp; feel justified in doing so. 

Finally, before 1973 laws banning abortion almost always had provisions for the punishment of the women for their abortions. [&lt;Source&gt;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_the_United_States#History). Women were not ""protected"" by anti-abortion laws, they were pursued by the state for violating these laws. If the supreme court were to invalidate their own previous abortion rulings, chiefly Roe v. Wade &amp; Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the status quo ante would prevail &amp; abortion would be illegal, in admittedly various forms, in 38 of 50 states immediately [&lt;Source&gt;](http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/fetal-homicide-state-laws.aspx).

I could actually go on, but to say that those who self-identify as pro-life don't want to punish women is to admit that you simply don't fully understand the history of the topic in which you speak. "	3.0	0.0	485	False	True

I literally got back a few hours ago from camping in a state park here and there were multiple sites that were playing music until around 10, with fires and talking/laughing until even later.

Basically comparing a Tuesday to a Saturday is like comparing what a bar restaurant is like on a Tuesday night vs a Saturday.  Again, this is public land, not yours, the rules are determined by the public, not just the enthusiasts.

Consider people like this being there a good thing, and them enjoying the park being a good thing, basically if parks aren’t accessible to all, they will cease to exist (since they exist purely due to the will of the public).  That may mean you have to deal with other people’s sound waves impeding into your space, however sound waves have never been seen as an impediment on the “your freedoms ends where mine begins” dichotomy.  Basically, don’t allow yourself to be so affected by others, and don’t have expectations of others to adjust their behavior, while within rules, on public land."	84.0	0.0	251	False	True

If an album tells a story or has a deeper meaning, than I agree with you. But if an album is simply a person's outlet or their own personal expression, then I see nothing wrong with using their image on the cover.

We'll use the Phil Collins album *Face Value* as an example. The album is simply about his personal life and his own thoughts and feelings. He's presenting his feelings at ""face value"". I believe the cover fits that. It's his face, because *his* expression of *his* emotions in musical form. The cover being in black and white represents that his ideas are presented in black and white. He's not trying to color anything up, or try and dress up his ideas to make it more presentable. He wants to express himself as straightforward as he can.

Another example is Selena Gomez's album *Revival*. The cover is simply her, naked, in black and white. The album is meant to be a ""naked"" or ""stripped down"" version of her feelings. I'll admit while it's not overly creative and the idea for the cover can be considered overused, it still fits the entire point of the album, and fits it well. The same can be said for the Phil Collins album. 

I think an album cover is less about being creative and more about being representative of an album. Doing both of course speaks volumes about the artist(s), but if an album is a simplistic expression of the artist, then why can't the cover reflect that? "	3.0	0.0	279	False	True

That's not remotely what they're for. And you made the claim that

&gt; most people will never touch algebra again after their formal education ends

so I hardly think my defense of it is ""punching strawmen."" Your claim is blatantly false. People touch algebra on a weekly if not daily basis. If you weren't being willfully misleading, it's ignorant or indicating a fundamental misunderstanding of what algebra is. Any and all of which suggest we need to spend more time teaching algebra, not less so we can send our children to therapists who absolutely don't teach cooking, family planning, or financial planning anyway. The mental health ramifications of not being able to take care of yourself can't be staved off in advance, but children don't really suffer from not being able to cook and financially plan until they're responsible for it. So not in elementary school, but in college maybe? After college? The best thing we can do is when they're children is not give them some kind of advance therapy but actually teach them how to do those things, which 1) doesn't happen in therapy at all, and 2) has academic fundamentals underlying it which you think ""most people don't touch""

And I would treat my children's teacher and my children's therapists very differently. Someone responsible for teaching my kid algebra forms a very different relationship with them than someone resolving my child's mental illness, potentially diagnosing them, expecting them to be deeply emotionally vulnerable, etc. Find the most ardent supporter of widespread therapy and even they'll be adamant that the therapeutic relationship depends a lot on the personality/methods of the therapist in a way that teaching algebra does not. A bad therapist, or even one that doesn't jive with you, can actively aggravate your mental health problems. A child and their parent need much more control over who provides them professional counseling than who teaches them to read. "	3.0	0.0	334	False	True

The first world war started as a response to British empire spreading across the globe. After the WW1, nations fucked over Germany. Que WW2.

But what was before. Why were British so imperialistic. Well they were in brutal conflict over the church with Spain. (inquisitions), and was nearly destroyed, if not for the doctrine of strong navy. That naturally evolved into expansion and then trade.

Okay, so why did the Inquisitions happened. Why did the parts of Catholic church rebelled and split?

Because Catholic church was affraid of loosing power, in spite of the blossoming spanish trade (from which nobilities prospered). Most nobles, and powerful people just happened to be Jewish. Que the hunt for the wicked.

We can go further and further, it's just a cycle of hostility, trickery, and responses to previous wrongs. Why do you make the arbitrary dividing line at the Treaty of Versailes?"	1.0	0.0	151	False	True

(b) have flaws which allow you to identify it as a simulation.

By saying that you currently haven't found any flaws is not sufficient proof to exclude option (b). On what grounds can you make that claim?

One of the most common fouls that you see at the levels I officiate is a foul to stop a break, this is to say the defending team are backtracking with a numerical disadvantage and rather than risk tackling and straight up losing the ball, they will play for a foul to stop play and allow players to get back into position. At the speed the game is generally played, players are generally keener to stop play than to allow play to continue, in these situations it is rare to play advantage. It’s not bad to play for fouls, however, I would argue that if there was a total clock stoppage it would encourage players to take more time to reset the game and if this happened it could encourage a team to make more fouls to slow down the pace of the game or change momentum- this could become an element of the way players play the game, but I don’t think it would improve the game, if anything it would be detrimental to the quality of the game and the viewers experience.

To be honest I can’t claim to be aware of all the ins and outs of your sport but from what you say it does seem similar, though the time limit is not applied in the same way. Basketball is an interesting example in terms of getting the ball back into play, the ball is often out of reach of the player, it could be in a stand and as we don’t tend to use a multi ball system at most levels it’s not always practical to impose a time limit. The system generally used is discretionary, that is, did the ball make it back onto the field of play within a timely manner, if it did then there is no time added on, if the ball remains in the stands or players are kicking it away then time will be added on. The ball going out of play is expected in the game, I suppose you could allow the clock to run arbitrarily for 10 seconds before stopping it.

Playing advantage is a key part of the game, as I mentioned in the previous paragraph and I think in a response to an earlier comment, timing of an advantage is discretionary. For the referee on the field, or a fourth official- when they are available, to time all stoppages is not necessarily that easy. From refereeing yourself you’ll know that your job as a referee is not just to watch where the play is happening at that point, to keep the pace of play up or to stop infractions on the field, there are so many different jobs involved. I wear a timer on my wrist in all games, it’s pretty simple and I take a look when I make a stoppage and I take a look when the play resumes, I make mental note of that time and generally an off field referee will also keep a note of stoppages, as I said, the period of time for a stoppage varies depending on the situation, so imposing time limits would be difficult. If the clock were to totally stop when the ball was declared dead by the referee and there was a way around stopping the clock in an advantage situation then I would recommend shortening each half.

Also, not all matches can be played with a huge number of officials, it’s the most widely played sport in the world and there isn’t always enough money in the game to have official time keepers at every game. There are also more grey areas in the sport than most others, introduction of VAR, which seems as though it will happen in at least the upper echelons of the game mean that play could be called back, this means that external timekeepers have to track the moment a foul was made, and this means that a device has to simply be created whereby the clock is stopped NOT by the moment a referee blows their whistle which communicates with the timer in the auditorium and the timer on the referees person. It’s not impossible, but logistically this isn’t easy to impose at all levels of the game in all countries."	2.0	0.0	742	False	True

From the web site developer's perspective, introducing a new ""reference implementation"" isn't particularly helpful.   You're still looking at the same ecosystem of web browsers (or maybe the same ecosystem plus one.)  I still occasionally look at stuff using lynx.  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_%28web_browser%29 )   Is this ""reference implementation"" supposed to convince me to stop doing that?   Alternatively, web developers who feel like they can dictate which browsers their clients use, are already doing that.   Tracking cross-compatability in some systematic fashion would be a mess.

For the web browser developer the situation is much the same.  The ecosystem of web site developers is just as if not more uncontrolled than the system of web browsers, and there are legacy websites with propriety and browser-specific implementations.  So you could build a ""reference implementation compatible"" browser, but that doesn't guarantee that it will work well with existing web sites.

In addition to the effects of simple entropy, the web is full of people trying to play the ""embrace, extend, and extinguish"" game.  As long as businesses have incentives to play that kind of game and there's no compelling reason for people to move away from legacy systems the ecosystem will continue to be fractured.   There are benefits to be had from a regulated web, but to make that happen you would need a whole lot more than a non-profit with a reference implementation.  It would require some kind of system involving certification and enforcement authority."	4.0	0.0	259	False	True

Sorry, you said you were worried that it would stop innovation.  How did anything you say here have anything to do with innovation? It seemed to be a lot of worrying about random stock prices and the total wealth of very specific people...

&gt;In what way is public ownership of the means of production compatible with capitalism?

By having the prices of goods, and the survival of companies dependent on a free market? Who owns the company doesn't matter as long as the market is free to work like it is supposed to.


&gt;It would be harder for companies to be successful if they are forced to be owned by their workers. 

Do you have any proof that this is true, or is it just a feeling you have?


&gt;Wouldn't they also have less access to resources, though?

I mean kinda, but not really? Restructuring companies obviously isn't easy, but it also should not cause them to collapse and lose all of their jobs. If it does then the anti-trust shit failed hard because instead of 2 possible choices you still go back to 1.


&gt;And there are still plenty of other social media services out there that aren't owned by Facebook.

&gt;&gt;Why is this a bad thing

&gt;&gt;&gt;Well it is a big step toward worker ownership of companies, which is a major component of socialism.

Corporations, as they currently exist, are not a natural result of the invisible hand. They are not simply a byproduct of capitalism. A business does not become a corporation until the government issues a corporate charter. This allows an organization to act independently as a legal person. 

It also shields investors from liability exceeding their initial investment for anything done with their money. This is known as limited liability. 

There are trade offs for this limited liability though. First and foremost is a corporate income tax. In addition to this there are corporate regulations that must be followed. 

If the government were to determine that 40% worker control of leadership of a corporation as a condition of incorporation would be beneficial to society or the economy or whatever, then I dont really see the problem there. If such a prospect were too onerous, said organization is perfectly welcome to forego the benefits of limited liability. 

&gt;I think that it is a misinformed position. Generally when you break up companies, it is because they have acquired too much of their competition. That is not entirely the case with technology companies. Facebook, for example, isn't the most popular social media site because it has acquired all of its competition, but because it is simply the most popular. Same with Google. It hasn't acquired all the other search engines, it's just the most used and quite frankly, the best. How do you even break these companies up? And if you did, how would that affect the massive number of jobs these companies offer?

[List of acquisitions and mergers by facebook](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Facebook). 76 of them. Including instagram and whatsapp. 

And google is no longer simply a search engine. It hasnt been for ages. In fact, since 2015, google has just been a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. Which also owns... just so many things. There is a reason they named it alphabet. Google (alphabet) isnt simply a search engine any more than Amazon is a simple textbook retailer

Do you really think that the majority of the women in those countries have a real choice in the matter? Where if they wanted a divorce they could actually get one? 

Firs consider whether the women in some of the countries you are looking up to even have the right to travel outside without being escorted by a male relative. Let alone making it to a court house to file a motion for divorce. 

Secondly consider, even if a women was able to make it to a courthouse and file the papers, would her husband let that be? Or will the husband be mad, and beat his wife and hold her hostage at home for the foreseeable future until she rethinks the divorce. If he doesn't outright kill her in a honor killing. 

That's something this thread has seemed to be missing. 

Do you support honor killings? If a girl sleeps with a men before marriage, should she be killed? If a girl is raped while not being married, should she be forced to marry her rapist? What about children? Do you support child marriages? Hell, even the US has it's own issues with child marriages that we seriously need to fix. But would you support a 11 year old girl, who was raped to be forced to marry a 40 year old man?

I'm not gay, so no, men don't turn me on.

&gt;Well that was an off the cuff example to try and show you my overall point. Crime is an extremely complex subject.

Sexual assault is even more complex.

&gt;According to that Wikipedia page, none of the top 10 countries (per capita) are Muslim.

Studies have been done on this and rape statistics are higher in a lot of western countries because people are much more likely to report that they were raped in western countries, and a lot more things are legally considered rape in western countries (spousal rape, for example) which are not even legally considered rape in Muslim nations.  Women in Muslim countries rarely report that they were raped when they were, because women are frequently literally murdered for having been raped.  And even when a woman does come forward to report a rape, in many Muslim countries, a woman cannot give legal testimony, so unless there was a male witness who will testify (women are not usually raped around impartial male witnesses), it's legally not considered to have happened.  Obviously this will produce MUCH lower official rape statistics than the actual number of rapes happening.  More detailed studies have found that there are high rates of rape - the vast majority of them just don't end up legally recognized as rape."	3.0	0.0	237	False	True

And I have no idea how people let this awful storytelling slide in a game that is praised for its storytelling.

Again, I personally didn't find anything about it jarring or confusing when I was playing for the first time.  

&gt; I wasn't referring to the actual audio diaries, I was referring to how interactions between Jack and other characters is done entirely by the other person speaking through a system with a picture of them in the bottom right corner. And as I previously mentioned, the Tennenbaum interaction when you wake up is a good example. My point was that there was no face to face interaction.

Well yeah, that's for two reasons.  They're talking to YOU, the PLAYER. ""Interactions"" aren't going to happen, because in an interaction *you can choose what to do*.  In a video game, you can't... at best you can choose one of four complete sentences.  The game is partly ABOUT this lack of choice.

 And, it helped them avoid focusing on close-ups of the character models, so they didn't have to waste resources on lip sync or attractive faces.

&gt; Well what kind of game is that? Not about characters? Really?

Yes, really.  Why are you acting like this is weird?  Plenty of narratives are driven by themes and not characters (one author, who went so far as to devote pages to screeds about the way she thought society should go, comes to mind especially easily right now).

&gt; I think you're over-complicating it. It's a simple plot twist: You thought you were free, but you're actually not. It's interesting at first, but like I said, there's no character development and nothing changes.

What about the entire premise of the game, where a guy whose name is almost an anagram of Ayn Rand establishes Galt's Gulch at the bottom of the ocean, and everything goes to hell because there wasn't a government regulating the stuff they were doing down there?  I'm not sure you're on solid ground if you think there isn't a whole lot going on about freedom, choice, and agency, both in video games and in politics.  They sure spend a helluva lot of time talking about it.



&gt; For a game that is praised for it's supposed moral choices, the fact that its only moral choice is a black-and-white-kill-or-not-kill choice is inexcusable.

It's not praised for its moral choices, it's praised for its *thematic examination of morality vis-a-vis freedom*.  ALL video game morality is simplistic... there's a literal formula calculating how good or evil you are!  That's what this game is trying to EXPOSE... all that ""freedom"" in those other games is an illusion.

Even the most morally complex and interesting games (like KOTOR2 or Planescape: Torment) have absolutely 0 things interesting about the character's ability to choose morality.  They just have good writing when the characters DISCUSS morality."	7.0	0.0	501	False	True

That simply isn’t true.  The conditions in Gaza exist in large part because Israel has imposed a blockade on it.   They may or may not be *justified* in imposing the blockade, but that wasn’t OP’s original arguement.    Ending the blockade would immediately improve conditions in Gaza.   The impact that would have on Israeli security is a separate question.

Hamas’ poor economic policy may also be terrible and would also leave Gaza poor, but its hard to test that premise under the shadow of the blockade’s effect on the economy.

Edit: Clarifying on rereading—OP *is* arguing that the blockade is justified for security reasons, but he doesn’t really expand on that premise, just accepts the argument.  His title and first paragraph still put most of the concrete blame on Hamas for the material conditions, though.

Edit2: Further reflection on how to stage it more clearly. OP basic idea is that Israel is not the “primary” cause of the humanitarian situation.   It really depends on what is meant by “primary.”   The causal chain basically goes:

Hamas seizes power—&gt;Israel faces a security threat from Hamas—&gt;Israel imposes a blockade with the dual goals of minimizing the threat and pushing Hamas out of power—&gt;the blockade results in humanitarian crisis

I’d argue that Israel “caused” the humanitarian situation through the actions it chose to take after Hamas took power.  Gaza would still be poor without the blockade, but it wouldn’t be absolutely destitute as it is now."	5.0	0.0	293	False	True

They just don’t like to talk about the second goal, because starving people out to force them to change their government isn’t really a legitimate policy tool.

If the goal was purely to ensure security, there are options for that like screening incoming shipments for weapons, finding ways to monitor the end use of supplies, etc.   Now, maybe Hamas rejects those, but then it becomes easier to argue that this is all Hamas’s fault and not just a punitive strategy."	3.0	0.0	131	False	True

Careful. You're sounding very much like an incel with that one. It might shock you, but the number of people someone's been with isn't a huge factor for a lot of people.

Firstly, the ""study"" had users rate an individual's attractiveness and then tracked their message sending. Despite rating men as less attractive than a standard bell curve, women sent an expected number of messages. Assuming that means women think men are unappealing or that women have too high standards is kind of ridiculous. 

A) maybe a dating website *isn't* a normal bell curve of attractiveness. 

B) maybe women are conditioned to be less comfortable opening admitting sexual attraction to strangers, particularly in a potentially sexual situation. 

C) maybe women dont base their level of attraction solely on physical attraction to a photograph so they wouldn't rate people as very attractive without getting to know them. 

D)or maybe the physical things women do find attractive are harder to convey in a photo than the physical things men find attractive. 

E)maybe men on Ok cupid, on average, put less effort into their photos than women did. 

F)maybe a dating website from a time when dting websites were less ubiquitous is just a bad, self selected group of subjects. 

G)maybe there were other factors that affected women's ratings more than men - like maybe they were unconsciously taking things like clothing, props, backgrounds, or even usernames into account in their ratings. 

H) maybe women rate men as below average attraction more often because they view themselves as below their level of attraction also. If my siblings are super smart, I might think of myself as relatively dumb. And if I think (rightfully) you're about as smart as i am, wouldn't I probably rate you as below average intelligence too? The issue there isn't your intelligence or even my perception of it, its that my whole baseline is shifted - my idea of intelligence isn't a standard bell curve.  

But most importantly, the ""research"" found that men disproportionately messaged the women they rated as most attractive while the women messaged a much broader range of people. 2/3 of men only messaged the top 1/3 of women, but women's messages almost exactly mirrored their attractiveness rating - ie, *they may have rated men as being less physically attractive but were* **far** *more likely to give them a chance and try to get to know them.*

No one wants to own something if they're not sure they will be able to sell it right away if the norm is that they are always able to sell it immediately. If the status-quo shifted such that there were an expectation of lower liquidity then the steady-state investment would surely remain roughly equivalent - lower liquidity wouldn't reduce peoples desire to earn capital gains. Is there another factor to this I'm not understanding? 

So you are acknowledging that there would be a shift from one status quo to another and that expectation of liquidity is currently of value. Do you not then see that shifting from scenario A where you have liquidity which you find valuable, to scenario B where you have less of said liquidity, would lead prices to move lower?

&gt; Surely this risk mitigation could be achieved through more traditional insurance models without being significantly disruptive. The effect should be the same but would limited to hedging the risk for the people who produce the commodities. Letting others who have no stake in the market hedge against it is like letting random people take out an insurance policy against me crashing my car. 

It's interesting that you bring up insurance, because insurance companies also use derivatives extensively to hedge. You should look into reinsurance companies and how they hedge the exposure they take on from retail insurers. It can get pretty esoteric, hedging disaster insurance like floods or fires with things like weather derivatives (which yes actually exist). These types of derivatives are also used in agriculture to hedge for things like crop yield fluctuations as well. Letting people who have no stake in the market take on risks associated with said market is a fundamental element of insurance.

&gt; I'll need to think more on this.

Especially in team sports, where a lot of success is dependent on things that aren't related to strength, like teamwork, reflexes and situational awareness, it probably won't make that much of a difference if you're a cis woman or a trans woman who transitioned before puberty. 

Also, one of the main reasons why women's sports isn't more popular is that sports organisations have deliberately tried to stop women's sports from being publicly viewed at all, and still continue to choose not to promote it more. Women's soccer used to be more popular in the UK than men's soccer, until the FA banned women from playing on official pitches.

Limited substitutions means the effects of injuries, fatigue, players being cautious on a yellow card, or just failed choices that aren't changeable are further reduced, and that benefits the team that has more resources.

Having unlimited substitutions would make squad depth that much more important, and that only benefits those who can afford the costs.

It would vastly reduce the efficacy of cards. Often players take yellows to prevent a promising attack, or they use ""rotational fouling"" where no one player fouls an opponent enough to get a yellow/red for persistent foul play. Unlimited subs would mean you could bring players on for the sole purpose of committing fouls, disrupting the game, and killing attacks.

My other concern is that substitutions take time and are already used to disrupt the flow of a game. Having unlimited subs would slow the game right down. You could always go for roll on/roll off subs but that would involve an overhaul to the way subs are made and require extra refereeing (could make things difficult at lower levels). It would certainly add delays though, as if a coach wants to put out five defensive players for a set piece or corner, that's five on that need to take up positions. Same for attacking plays from corners or long throws. The one thing football doesn't need is people wasting more time.

I also think there's something to be said in favour of limitations. It means that the way the game is initially approached matters much more. How a team sets up for a game isn't a trivial decision. Formations are more rigid as wholesale changes can't be made, and we get to see strategies and tactics play out over 90 minutes rather than be in a state of flux in which the system constantly changes. I also think the level of organisation required in football systems wouldn't lend itself to chopping and changing so much anyway (I suppose that might be a plus to your side as teams wouldn't actually utilise their subs too often). Personally, I don't want to see a constantly shifting game, I want to see whether a team's tactics work over 90 minutes."	3.0	0.0	384	False	True

Or throw it into the sun if we're worried it'll hit a space marmot in 90,000 years.

That's...not how orbits work.

If you just throw something in a random direction, it will be in approximately the orbit you were, and it will pass through (roughly) the same place relative to the body it's orbiting repeatedly. The more we do that, the more we increase the probability of colliding with something near the bodies we visit frequently.

If you actually want to make it not a problem, you need to throw it out of the solar system, which takes a *lot* of energy. It's easier the further out you are, but even if you're near Jupiter's orbit, you still need to throw things at about 5 km/s to get them to leave the solar system.

Throwing it into the sun is actually even *harder*.

For instance, the client might not have fully informed the contractor. For instance, if the government contracts a railroad company to build rails, and the contract stipulates that the government must acquire the land to build it on. However, legal challenges/changes in the law make the government unable to get the land by the time the contract says. Getting rid of the contract now would be inefficient, far more inefficient than waiting for the legal issues to be resolved. Additionally, events outside of the control of both parties could slow things down or spike the cost without it being an inefficient action. Natural disasters, international conflicts, or supply chain disruption could all be problems without any inefficiencies.

That’s not to say inefficiency doesn’t exist. Humans aren’t perfect, and every project will have some limit to how efficient it can be. There are also real examples of incompetence or corruption slowing construction. Whether these are the root cause of the widespread slowdown you are concerned about, however, isn’t clear.

Finally, it is also possible that this apparent inefficiency is simply a function of our current world. It is possible that all major projects that you are concerned with are operating at their peak efficiency, and any efforts to clamp down on the hypothetical corruption or incompetence would lead to even more cost overruns. This might not be the most reassuring possibility, but it is one that suggests that inefficiency isn’t the culprit."	78.0	0.0	257	False	True

Poor estimation methods can factor into it, but that's not really the heart of the problem.  I'll try to explain because I do this for a living.

When you're quoting a large multi-year project that's going to cost millions or billions of dollars you get some requirements that you use to generate the quote.  Those requirements vary in level of detail.  Where there isn't enough detail you make assumptions and estimate.

One of the ways that you get into cost overruns is that your assumptions were wrong.  It happens, and it can often mean the project costs a lot more than was planned.

But there's another place that you get into even bigger cost overruns most of the time.  See when you estimate the cost/effort needed to do something you can do that estimate in lots of different ways.  You can assume everything goes right the first time around and make your estimate based on that.  Or you can assume lots of things will go wrong and make your estimate based on that.  Now obviously the estimate assuming that everything goes right will be much cheaper than the estimate where everything goes wrong, so when you have multiple companies competing to win a project like this, it's common for companies who quote more aggressively to win the bid.  But in reality, things *always* go wrong.  The companies who quote aggressively know that.  And they also know that when those things go wrong, they'll pass the cost on to the customer.  And that's the biggest reason you get these cost overruns, because the original planned cost was never realistic in the first place."	2.0	0.0	299	False	True

I think you are underestimating the difficulty of properly estimate such complex and long term ventures with so many moving parts.  Most people cannot even predict the amount of time it would take to fully clean their house and garage and expect experts to be able to accurately predict the time and expense of years long projects including hundreds or thousands of people and often needing to navigate different locale communities and special interest groups and etc.

&amp;nbsp;

Now the natural answer people come up with is ""they are trained to do that"".  Ok, what training teaches you to do that?  How does that training perform IRL?  Do you know the first bit about that training?  And if you're not well informed on what would allegedly allow them to accurately plan all of this then what makes you so sure it's inefficient?   

Not to mention that even if they had the best of training with an impossible 100% success rate with correct information...who says they're being correct information or indeed even have all the information.  Every project has a significant amount of missing information that impacts completion dates and costs that is not known before the project starts.  Like any project started before COVID lol would be one of the easiest to understand examples right now.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Planning long range is already incredibly difficult even with simple things.  I think you're simply underestimating the difficulty.  Though if you wanted to lower the difficulty and costs of such planning then lowering the rights of your people and their wages achieves that pretty well.  Less rights = less variables from worker availability to special interest groups to local groups to etc.  And ofc less wages not only = less money overall but less variability in the overall cost outcome."	2.0	0.0	347	False	True

Countries *love* supporting, or at least overlooking, atrocities.  Everyone tut-tutted the crackdown surrounding the Tiananmen Square massacre, when the Chinese killed thousands of college students on live TV.

My question is, do *you* support those atrocities?

Yes, the foolishness of China’s economic policies has been evident for a long time.

I hope you don’t use that reasoning in your own life.  “I have been smoking for years.  Why should I stop?”  “I have been drinking and driving since college.  Never had an accident.” 

In the case of China, the cracks have begun to show:

* China’s second-largest builders, Evergrande Group, has $300 billion in bad loans — that is about 2% of the total tax-revenues of China; nothing about the loans are particular to Evergrande
* Housing prices have dropped 30% this year, which may cause the GDP to drop by 10%.  This is worse than any drop in US GDP during the Great Depression.
* Homeowners have called mortgage strikes in at least 300 cities.  This has forced regional banks into insolvency.  
* After flatly refusing to pay off on deposit insurance, the Chinese government has claimed it will pay off some depositors of insolvent banks.  It is not clear this is enough to prevent collapse of the banking system.
* The government has promised war with Taiwan over the Pelosi visit: either it will deliver, resulting in the utter destruction of the PRC, or it will back off, causing the government to look weak.

Will the PRC survive to see the Year of the Water Rabbit, six months from now?  _Maybe_.

But everything is very, very bad and there is no appetite for reform anywhere in the CCP.  Xi seems to be doubling down on bad policy in every sector. 

The 20th National Congress is coming up later this year.  Xi will probably try to get himself elected “Chairman” or even “Leader”, titles that have not been used since Mao.  If he succeeds, it will likely mean stasis until a *Downfall*-style final collapse of the PRC government; if he fails and is purged, the government may be able to survive, following a period of chaotic reform."	2.0	0.0	402	False	True

That's why I specified *overtly* and mentioned personal attacks.

I think your definition of echo chamber is simply far too broad. Most communities, even ones which have limited censorship rules in place, have a diverse community of individuals with varying world views. For example the exclusion of racist people doesn't mean all non-racist people remaining will agree on everything, especially if the community in question is based around something very different like economics, video games, or whatever else.

The only time banning racists would create an echo chamber is in the context of a community who's primary engagement is the discussion of racism. In this context all members would constantly be exposed to anti-racist views which reinforce their beliefs. 

However, in the context of a community based around discussing economics, banning racist people has very little effect on the dialogue. It isn't necessary to have racist opinions expressed in that context in order to avoid constant exposure to one set of ideas/ideals. The remaining members who aren't racist will never (or rarely) share those views and will still disagree about many other things related to economics."	3.0	0.0	191	False	True

I live in a state where urban changes to corn fields in less than mile. And while I hate to stereotype and say that it turns into ""Trump Country"" it would mean ignoring all of the flags and billboards announcing it as such. I can't help but to think of it as a bandwagon thing. Lots of people show public support and repeat the things they hear to simply not be ostracized by their community. Im not naive enough to think that none of them believe it but hear enough of it at the local bar and people start saying the same things to not stick out. It gets hard to gauge how many people actually believe it but not everyone who says those things would actually fight for it.

>I don't think voting metrics on their own serve as a concrete example of political leanings, as I am well aware of the tendancy to refuse to vote because of a lack of faith in the candidates most in line with ideology.

There will always be a certain amount of people that don't vote because of lack of faith but those same people also wouldn't fight hard for their opinions either. The point I was trying to make is that they don't view people with opposing views as harshly as someone who voted specifically so the ""other side"" doesn't win. That type of mindset is necessary to actually start a civil war.

>The part I am most interested in further discussing is about the government dealing with radical's militarization. Would Jan 6th not be evidence enough of the potential problem with relying on the government to step in?

I actually don't think that Jan 6th was a big deal all things considered. Was it bad? Yes but aside from the loss of life it was relatively harmless and that harmlessness it what allows the GOP to be neutral enough to look like they condone it. The problem that the GOP is facing is that Trump has essentially created a large rift in the party. They can not secure elections without at least some of the Trump vote and that's what's keeping the GOP from speaking out against it. Most of the people who did speak out against it didn't win their elections. However, none of them have intervened against the FBI investigating or sentencing the participants. The GOP's silent condoning of it only goes far enough to maintain their voting base. 

The real concern is paramilitary groups that have been silently growing. They're actively seek disenfranchised young white men and radicalizing them and providing them with military training. Some of these groups are already on FBI watch lists which is both reassuring and scary because that means the government is taking them seriously. I think if any of them acted in a meaningful way the GOP would be forced to make a choice, either they continue to stay silent and risk losing their more moderate base or speak out against it and lose the support of the radicals that they don't actually want to admit they need.

>I acknowledge that racial tensions have always been a problem, and my perception is a real factor in my position. It just seems to be exacerbated by white supremacists being far more comfortable with being open about theirs.

They are still there - they are just being pulled along much like Bernie has pulled along some democrats (not to the same extent). If you look at the polls Trump has like 50% locked up and the other 50% is split amongst 7 people. The real issue is nobody in the GOP agrees on next steps.

Some want to moderate and become ""more appealing"" which usually means sacrificing values 
Some feel that the GOP has done nothing but ""moderate"" since Reagan and it has resulted in 2 Mediocre presidents and a long march to economic and social leftist
Some want to rejuvenate historical America (at least the ideal of the 50s or 80s) and think somebody like Trump can do it

So these responses would then be natural, not societal. The societal response is following the natural one, not causing it - I guess that's what I'm trying to get at, because society doesn't happen in a vacuum. If you remove society, they will still have a hard time processing a rape because a rape is a hard thing to process.	2.0	0.0	69	False	True

As of that point, it was basically proven via WWII and the Cold War that fascist and communist regimes *could* be destroyed by crisis, and that liberal democracies were more resilient (having survived both world wars, several economic recessions, and head-to-head battles with the strongest fascist and communist regimes on the face of the earth).	1.0	0.0	62	False	True

But this story is both inaccurate and simplified to uselessness. 

A country can coerce another into a political dissolution through espionage, sabotage through espionage, economic pressure, military threat. The life of the Soviet Union was influenced by a vast amount of external and internal factors. The external threats, being the US, would strain and influence internal problems, including the illegal dissolution of the USSR with an enthusiastic ally to Yeltzin. 

Now it is true that to get to the point where Yeltzin is able to dissolve the union unilaterally and illegally was caused by stagnation, but the implication of this is always used as a failure communism, as the ""End of history"" suggests, and that is simply not true.

The dissolution was a overwhelming unpopular decision that brought with it demonstrations to reinstate the union, suppressed both by foreign allies and by Yeltzin. The dissatisfaction with leadership and downward turn to stagnation really started with Khrushchev's change from a ideologically communist motivated system built by Stalin to a ""reformed"" command economy devoid of Communist ideology and dialectical materialist understanding of the world. 

Khrushchev wanted to compete head to head with the west, militarily and economically, where such a thing was not viable, combined with changes in how the economy worked lead to a stagnation where the USSR relied more and more on the west. This culminated with reforms by Gorbachev introducing private businesses and the entirety of Perastroika, which did not help the declining quality of life.

 During this time people were very unhappy with the communist party. It had lost its ideology at the core of leadership and was an administrative husk of its former self. In demonstrations, those who had lived under the communist government of Stalin wanted a return to the good times and growth in living conditions brought by him and his ideological leadership, not a turn to capitalism, as Yeltzin had done by taking advantage of the party's weakness, as some wanted to see any change. 

So when Yeltzin took power, he took this as his chance to reintroduce capitalism and illegally dissolve the union. It wasn't a collapse, as more of a murder caused by weakness in ideology of the party, leading to mismanagement and stagnation."	1.0	0.0	395	False	True

And that's a really fair point. We don't have loads of Americans walking about in Scotland. Just because in my experience they seemed to have lacked social awareness that their Scottish culture is not my own doesn't mean everyone who identities as such will be just as short sighted. Some generalisations of my own in there.

Don't get me wrong, I really love the way Americans can be fascinated with their history, the way yous can show pride for people long gone is very respectful to your heritage in ways we just don't tend to thing over here. 

I think that my appreciation for that part of your culture has gone, uncommunicated. This genuinely isn't a ""I hate America"" post. More of a ""I'm bothered by the constant misrepresentation of what my culture is"" kind of post. 

Thanks for being so respectful, even if you don't agree with me. I've not had the same experience with everyone across this post. Some people take the notion different identities so personally, you lose the subjective nature of it all in the heat of it."	1.0	0.0	186	False	True

My followup question, though, is do you think someone with 100% of that ethnic origin is entitled to spread misinformation and stigma about their culture?

Essentially, what I'm seeing is that your issue is with ignorance, and that can appear at any level of ethnic purity. I'm a 4th generation American with 80+% Irish ancestry. I've got a fair few alcoholics in my family, but I'm not spouting off ignorant trash about it being a uniquely irish thing. If my 1st generation Vietnamese friends are spreading trash about Asian and Vietnamese culture mostly inspired by Fox News, I don't think their ethnic purity entitles them to that...

Again, my confusion with your post is why someone's ethnic purity is a factor is whether or not it's wrong to spread ignorance."	2.0	0.0	140	False	True
