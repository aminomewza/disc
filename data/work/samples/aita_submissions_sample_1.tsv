I am great friends with who we'll call Sarah. We met through youth group when we both attended years ago, had feelings for each other at one point, and have loosely stayed in touch in the past year. For a bit of time, I was thinking it would be nice to catch up with her. We'll do this time to time, and the funny thing is each time one of us brings this up as an idea, the other will say that they've been thinking about wanting to do the same. Anyways, this time after not speaking for a few months, she gave me a text. So naturally, I agreed and said I'd love to see her. I then asked what she was doing Friday. She responded that she had free time between 1:30 and 9:30 pm. Since I couldn't be free til around 7, I asked if we should choose another day. She thought that we would still have some decent time, so we might as well go for it. Even though I wanted the night to go later, I didn't put too much thought into it and agreed. Fast forward to the night, we went to a local coffee shop where I bought her gelato, and we had a great time. Later on she showed me her dorm and projects she had recently worked on for classes. Everything went great until 10 pm came and she said we'd have to end our time because she was meeting up with another guy. Now I'll admit I don't really have the intentions of dating her seriously long term, but with that being said, I felt a little bit like I was just the appetizer warming her up for her second date that night. The gelato wasn't extremely expensive, but deep down I felt like I at least was owed the dignity of knowing I could be her date that night. Am I the asshole for feeling somewhat frustrated about this?	19	47

I've been upper level with an online group for over three years, I'm currently one of the most senior members and have been involved from the revitalization to present through all of our projects.

We deal with an ever changing field of topics. We've done card game development, game convention management, and hosted game servers. We've also done plenty of streaming and youtube.

Recently, we've had a sharp drop in community size, as we no longer have any public projects retaining or bringing in new members. Wehosted a Teamspeak server for over a year, but recently switched to Discord.

Teamspeak 3 and Discord are Voice over IP programs, used to communicate with each other, as well as leave plenty of space for community members to hang out and do whatever. The community is sort of split between a main group consisting of fans for streams and content, and my sub-group which is a slightly older gang of friends that have ended up here for one reason or another over the years. In our current state, I don't do much for the group besides moderate the Discord and deal with my own side business.

**Here's the important Part:**
Recently, I've had lots of trouble from one member of the main group. Spamming, posting NSFW content, ect. After warning him multiple times, he and three friends decided it would be funny to spam the hell out of the chat channels. In discord, chat channels are all public and you are by default notified of chat messages, which appear as desktop notifications. I got on and saw the absolute mess, with a few messages asking them to stop, no dice.

I do my job and remove the main issue from the server permanantly. I then remove the other three for the remainder of the day. As I usually do, I left messages in the admin chat explaining that I had removed them.

Later in the night owner (my boss) hopped on and told me off for eviscerating the remains of the community. I insist that without a community project, we can have a friendly community or retain all of our members. He gets passive aggressive about how he wants to work on the project that he's doing and tells me to go about my business (Clearly not happy with how I'm doing it.)

The move was a bold one. Those four function similar to me in my own group. By removing them, even temporarily it seems as though they've taken the entirety of their friends (a large chunk of our daily userbase) and gone off to start their own discord.
They don't provide us with anything, but if you work in this way you know that losing a community member means that they won't recruit for you. A large community draws people in on it's own and missing out on those guys is a possible future issue.


**Was it the right decision to remove members for misconduct and hurt the company, or should I have let them continue like the boss wanted?**

*If you have questions about this, please ask. I probably worded this horribly.*"	18	3

Anyway, a new vendor gave us a gift card as thank you for using him. The guy is really nice and great, he only problem is the card has no money on it. These types of vendors will buy up batches of gift cards and give them out. This guy is giving out incentive cards that have all been charged a fee that wiped off the balance. 

I know it’s an honest mistake and it doesn’t bother us. We’re still gonna keep using him. I want to tell him though, because I know he’ll keep giving them out and that’s embarrassing for him. 

But it seems in poor taste to tell him. "	4	6

I showed him the order total which was still open on my phone, and after he called his boss who had him tell me that they upcharge for deliveries outside their normal area, and an email was sent with the real total. The driver then just gave me $3 in cash out of pocket without much fuss. 

  
As it turns out, their website lists in small print at the bottom that they upcharge for deliveries outside of their normal range (Google maps lists me at 3.4 miles away).

 I feel kind of bad that it does in fact say that on the website but also feel like they should list the actual total or have the disclaimer somewhere near it. What do you think?"	2	12

But I'm quite sure what I said was ""I wish you wouldn't have invited me over here if you just wanted to sleep."" Then moved onto ""wasted time"" when we were angry.

&amp;#x200B;

Last night I got a booty call around midnight while I was at a party at my friend's place from a girl I have been seeing on and off for over a year. I made it to her house about 20 minutes after she invited me and found her laying on her bed, hardly opening her eyes to talk to me. I tried talk to her for a while but she was basically just laying there. I thought maybe she was just really serious about having sex and didn't want any pleasantries. Again, no. She just wanted to go to sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

She did sleepily ask me to cuddle with her, but I was not interested in going to sleep - I was wide awake. Realizing the situation, disappointment set in as I tried to figure out what I was going to do: 1) drive back to my friends which felt weird to consider place 2) go home and be bored 3) end the fun night I was having prematurely and hope I can fall asleep (I often can't in situations like this).

&amp;#x200B;

As I considered this, I sighed and said, ""I wish you wouldn't have invited me over if you were just going to waste my time."" At this, she gets really defensive and angry and insists that I'm being unreasonable for presuming that she could ""know how tired she was going to be in 30 minutes,"" which I say is a reasonable thing to be able to predict in yourself. Worse than this she launches into this whole thing about how I'm a sleazy guy for just wanting sex. For one, that's what she call me for (implicitly, from our conversation earlier in the day, and from all the dirty texts in the days before). Secondly, I genuinely didn't care about having sex. I wasn't even horny this night but I am always happy to please people I'm in a relationship with if they want it. But most of all, I just expected at the very least that someone inviting me over would stay up with me and hang out. So yeah, I thought she was wasting my time by inviting me over and then expecting me to sleep just because that's what she suddenly wanted to do.

&amp;#x200B;

For some context, this was a dumb argument that snowballed into something really big because of how frustrated her back-handed comments made me: ""I just thought it would be nice to spend some time together."" *Implying I don't like spending time with her.* ""I feel weird that you're angry because I don't want have sex with you."" *Implying that it's just about the sex (and not the sleeping) and I'm some sort of pervy sleaze.* ""You're right, I'm just the worst!"" *Even though I said no such thing, I just disagreed.*

&amp;#x200B;

We've been together on and off for over a year and though we've had issues we've never had an actual argument where we were pissed at each other. So, that's why I'm worried about something so seemingly trivial -- because the bullshit the ensued after feels like it might end the relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

So, am I the asshole for being angry/disappointed for her wasting my time?

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT2: Resolution:**

&gt;Yeah, it would be annoying for someone to go to sleep that quickly, but you do sometimes hit a wall, and I'm sure it wasn't her intention.

Thanks for this. Genuinely. This is the only comment here that has me actually re-thinking my actions (and it has zero karma, what's up with that?!). Because I seriously did think it was unreasonable to not be able to predict how tired you would be and was also truly disappointed with the situation I was left with. Combine those two things and I feel like I have been willingly wronged.

But you're right. She wouldn't have intended the outcome that happened and it was unreasonable of me to fault her for getting tired. Her intentions were good. I really would have appreciated a simple apology for her getting tired, or just something that shows she can see how it'd feel to be in my shoes, but I get it. She's a little drunk, a lot tired. That's not crossing her mind in that state.

I've now sent her this text message because of this post:

Hey *affectionate nickname*, I just wanted to apologize for the other night. I should have known your intentions were all good and kept that at the forefront of my mind, but I didn’t. It was unreasonable of me to expect you to control your need for sleep. I was disappointed with the situation and was hoping you’d appreciate that disappointment but I understand why you wouldn’t at that time, especially after things got heated. Love you, *piecemealed*."	69	65

I genuinely don’t know if iata and am willing to take what i learn from this thread to help improve my future decisions. 

A few months ago my friend’s girlfriend was grabbed by the butt by a guy in the hallway. He is a freshman, and in the middle school has touched nearly a dozen other girl’s butts and they went to the middle school principal and nothing was done about it. 

Then a couple weeks into his freshman year he grabbed a friend of my girlfriend’s butt in the hallway on the way to lunch. Our school got refitted with cameras this year. Every classroom has a camera and every part of nearly every hallway is on camera too. He tried to play it off and kept walking. I was told about this. The girl who was groped was upset over it but didn’t want to report it for various reasons. I asked my girlfriend when and where it happened so that i could report it to the school. And so i went to one of the few administrators i trust in the school (i’m not a freshman so i’m familiar with the administration, most people are new). And i told her when where and what the kid’s name was. She went onto the cameras and got the evidence. The kid was called up to the office during a class with the girl who was groped and my girlfriend. So the girl who was groped found out and got upset. And my girlfriend sides with her friend on this. 

I debated reporting it before i did. My reasoning was not me trying to be a savior. I knew the girl probably wouldn’t like it if i reported it. The reason i did was because my girlfriend also has 2 classes with this kid. And should it happen to her and i didn’t report it, especially if it happened on camera then she likely wouldn’t be believed or not much would happen. I don’t know what kind of punishment (if any) the kid received but i don’t doubt that if he gets caught again he will get in a lot. Also, this kid has done it to other girls at the middle school and got away with it. I thought if he got caught the first time he did it in the high school with all the cameras it would act as a deterrent and he at least wouldn’t try it again during school. Finally, i also thought if he got away with it he would surely do it again to someone else. Even if it was not my girlfriend. And that any future victims would appreciate the evidence from the previous time because it was 100% proven on camera. Thus the next victim might not need video evidence. "	4	7

For context, my work environment is VERY busy and fast-paced. People work towards very stressful deadlines, and if you’re contributing as you should, there is almost zero downtime. This day, I had a very intense workload, as did the 5-person team I supervise. We were all stressed.

Enter two coworkers, I’ll call them Rima and Lucy. Both are women in their mid-20s. I am not their supervisor, but was well-within earshot of them, as we have one of those terrible open office spaces. Their supervisor was leaving in two weeks and very much checked-out. 

Rima (who has put in her notice) and Lucy, are  junior, hourly employees who have been chatting nonstop for about an hour. I know it’s not work related based on some words I pick up. For several minutes, I wait for their supervisor or another senior employee on their team to intervene, but none of them do. Most of the managers at my company are young, and many of them are very non-confrontational. I’m getting increasingly frustrated.

I use the internal chat system to message a senior staff member in their row who ignores me. At one point, I go to the kitchen to get a snack, and another junior employee on their team complains to me that he can’t do his work because of the talking. 

At that point, I go up to them in their row and say: “guys, the chatting has to stop. This is a common working environment.” They have guilty looks on their faces and stop talking, and I go back to my work. I told them off within earshot of their row, but with a normal speaking voice. Ie. Not excessively loudly. 

The next day, I find out that Rima complained to the department manager, feeling like she was disrespected because she was “publicly shamed.” The manager tells me off about it, and tells me I should have brought them into another room and talked to them privately. I apologize for creating a situation my manager had to deal with, but told her I was on fundamental disagreement with her point of view.  

My opinion is that the burden of expectations should be on staff to act professionally, not for managers to disrupt their work flow to walk on eggshells around disrespectful employees. Besides, pulling them into a separate room would have been just as conspicuous given the office layout. 

I was certain I was in the right but when I vented about it privately to a friend of mine in the office also told me I was in the wrong. His opinion also bothers me, as he told me that I should have “used the opportunity to act as a female mentor to young women instead of berate them.” I find this attitude to be paternalistic (shouldn’t women my age be expected to be as professional as everyone else?), and puts an extra expectation of emotional labor on me, who already has a team to manage. I also have an odd sense that there is a gender dimension to this as I frequently tell the male members of the tech team to lower their voices when they’re talking about memes, but nobody has ever taken issue with that. 

AITA?

Most people in our friend group do but she has it the worst

I care about her, but it’s so exhausting comforting her because she just refuses to ever listen to anything I or anybody says

She also is kind of,, I don’t know, for lack of a better word, selfish maybe? 

My mom is abusive, I was trying to find someone who’s house I could stay at for a bit in our group chat, and she says “oh that sucks.” Then proceeds to talk about her boyfriend for like thirty minutes. (It turned out fine, one of my friends DM’d me and I went to her place.) 

And she’s constantly saying depressing shit in the group chat, now more then ever sense her previously mentioned boyfriend broke up with her because she was being really really overwhelming in their relationship (he’s my best friend of 8 years, as to why I know the reasons of their breakup. He didn’t tell her that but that’s what it was.) And it’s discord so I just pretend I don’t see it

But I feel awful. She’s a person who has mental problems as so many of us do and I’m just ignoring her

There’s a few people in group chat who try and talk and calm her down but she just keeps saying “no, you’re wrong, I’m garbage” and refuses to take any compliments and god it’s so annoying!

I feel bad for feeling this way.

To be honest I’m not even that close with her, I’ve only seen her in person once, and I’d consider us to really only be acquaintances. Mutual friends.

This is all over the place, I apologize 

Please be honest, rip me a new one if you have to"	2	8

There's about 5 of us and we usually drive around town and hang out on one of the days. My oldest cousin (21) is the one who drives us so ultimately he gets final say on who gets to come.

My youngest cousin (13, only child), we'll call him Tristan, has medium/low-functioning autism. He can sometimes act properly but he's more of a nuisance than anything else. He constantly makes disruptive, loud noises and harasses strangers. Usually he doesn't hang with us and stays home with the rest of the family, but this year his mom/my aunt asks him if he wants to go and says yes. Then one of my other cousins (17) says ""We're going to an escape room and then going bowling, so the music and sounds may be too loud for him."". My aunt then says that we can spend a few hours with him, drop him off back at the house, and then go out without him. My oldest cousin says he's sorry and that he can't change our plans to accommodate him. Then my aunt goes on this whole rant about how Tristan is just like us and that he just wants to hang out with his cousins for once. But what's funny is that Tristan doesn't really seem to care at all but whenever his mom asks him he unenthusiastically says yes. She says that he's being sincere but I don't buy it. Then I asked if she was more angry about it than he was. She then gets really angry with me and tells me that he can't express emotions that well and that he does want to hang out with us and that we're all entitled. She storms out of the room. 

Then we try getting out of the house and Tristan follows us. So now I'm second-guessing myself and I guess he actually wants to go with us. But then one of my cousins tricks him into going back into the house by saying that there's a game for him inside (which is kinda shitty imo). So he goes inside and we drive off.

AITA/AWTA?

TL;DR: Autistic cousin ""wants"" to hang out with us, we say no, his mom says we need to take him, we decide not to because it seems that she's more upset with it then we are. Turns out he does want to go and my other cousin sends him on a wild goose chase to leave us alone.

we had met before school started once before, and when that happened she actually came out to me as bisexual. I’m completely supportive of anyone that’s a part of that community, but when she started high school she told me she was no
longer bi and that it was just a phase she went through.  honestly i didn’t care that much, as long as she’s happy so was i until she started to get a little meaner and less supportive of my decisions. 

she would flirt with guys constantly and would always brag about the amount of boys that liked her. by the time hoco had rolled around she had asked 6 different boys to hoco then broken off their date then would move on to the next guy. it eventually became intolerable because she would complain about problems that she made. eventually i stopped talking to her completely, but she was still friends with many of my friends.

she ended up dating a guy for around a month but broke up with him because he was moving to slow. after that, she started talking to this mystery guy we all knew as Logan. she also became very close with a friend of mines bf. let’s call him R.

R had a history of cheating on girlfriends then braking up with them to date the girls he had fooled around with, and a few of my close friends made a swear she wouldn’t mess around with him.  

right before christmas break the guy A was talking to hooked up with another girl and A lost her shit. she started crying in school even though they were never really dating and spent the rest of the week complaining about it. then we started to notice that she was spending A LOT of time with R. 

apparently she had started talking to him about how his gf didn’t really like him that much and how they just weren’t meant to be. R broke up with her and guess what ? almost immediately started to date A even though she was very close with Rs ex gf. 

at this point i was pretty furious being that i was also close to Rs ex gf and was a friend of R and knew that he was gonna end up getting hurt. But if we ever tried to talk to R about it he’d ignore us.

at this point my friend group pretty much despised A bc she was obnoxious and full of herself and did this awful thing were she would go up behind you and grab your boobs no matter how many times you told her to stop. the final straw was when she told one of my best friends who has struggled with self love for a long time, ( and is very open about it) that she is extremely fake. she asked her if anything about her was real, like her nails or her hair or the fact that she wore makeup. 

i was so livid that i screamed at her, “WELL AT LEAST SHE HAS REAL FRIENDS” she ignored me for a week, and frankly i was fine with it.

now comes the last part of this story. my school goes on a ski trip every year cause we live very close to a ski resort. it’s a two day long over night trip, and the whole way on the bus A was cuddling with some guy that was not R. (he didn’t go on the trip) she even went as far to buy  them a milkshake put two straws in it so they could drink it together like in the movies.

then that night she started telling people that some guy had kissed her ( which ended up being a huge lie ! ) and was bragging about how hot he was.  no one had the balls to tell R tho so she got away with it . on the way home tho, SHE STARTED CUDDLING WITH THE GUY AGAIN AND SHE HAD THE NERVE TO DO IT IN HER BOYFRIENDS SWEATSHIRT! i was so angry that i texted her bf and told him everything that happened.

he texted me and said that he was grateful that i told him and that he was gonna have to talk to her about it, we go back to school tomorrow and i’m worried that there is gonna be beef for me when i get there. idk wether i’ve done something wrong and need to apologize for butting in, or if she finally got what she deserved. am i the asshole? 

TLTR - a girl kind of cheated on her bf and i told him about it and now i think i broke them up.

She has also one by one decided she hates me and my other 2 roommates and now we rarely see him unless she's busy. I remember months ago when he happily told me he took her virginity and they're all of a sudden into a bunch of kinky sex and shit, and he's super in love with her, and she will give him head like twice a day all the time.

Today my friend Jack, who lives in another apartment told me about his roommate, Matt, who is Dan's girlfriend's ex. He said that she alienated him from his friends, and they had sex all the time, and the relationship ended when she cheated on him.

I told him the night I heard this, because my conscience would't let me just sit on that when he didn't know. So I brought him into a side room and let him know everything I heard, and that I wasn't accusing her of anything, but telling him exactly what I heard from her ex and he can make a judgement. He thanked me and seemed really appreciative and said ""Thank you, I don't want to date a liar"". And I reassured him that I would find more out before he goes doing anything.

He ran downstairs to talk to her, they started arguing, and 30 minutes later I get a text. ""Don't interfere with our relationship. It's none of your business."" And something along the lines of ""Why are you trying to hurt our relationship"".

At the top of the stairs he said ""I don't want to date a liar"" and at the bottom of the stairs he said ""Why are you trying to interfere in our relationship"". ???

Am I an asshole for telling him this? Or is my suspicion that she's manipulating him valid? This is just really bothering me. Also, was it in my right to tell him?"	50	24

There are 5 friends in this friend group. We've been together for 6 months. We all love each other, and Me, Friend A, B, and C, who are all boys, 18. Then there is the Friend F, who is a female, also 18. Friend F comes from a traumatic background, as she had a five year-boyfriend who broke up with her a year before college resumed. She's bipolar and her dad was in a serious car accident about a week ago.

She came into our group because she liked friend B, but friend C also likes her and would do absolutely anything for her. She had sex with Friend B over winter break, and she got pregnant. She aborted the baby, as she was convinced by both Friend B (who said he'd support every decision she made) and her own conviction. Friend B and Friend F have been estranged ever since. Friend F is on good terms with me, most of the time anyways. Friend C has pretty much been kissing up to her ever since. Friend A and I are bystanders and usually watch the drama, but it has been a bit too much, and today I spoke up.

The day before yesterday was my birthday, and I spent a whole damn hour comforting her and attempting to help her talk to Friend B about her feelings, and when it came down to it, she hyperventilated and ran out. I asked a mutual friend who knew absolutely nothing about the situation about what we should do about Friend F, to which he replied, I should cut her off from the group. Armed with that and common sense, I texted in the group chat, without Friend B and Friend F, that we should totally cut Friend F from the group because of her toxicity, and that she can still talk to us but not the friend group as a whole. Friend C told her that he would continue talking to her, but he agreed that we should take her out. Friend A talked to me in person and echoed the same result. 

A few hours later, while I'm chilling with Friend B and A, Friend F comes to the door and tells me I'm a fake friend, and that I fucking hate her, which I don't. I fumble around trying to explain myself to her and she punches me in the chest and goes away. Friend C coddles her in his room, and shows her more of what I said in the group chat. At this point, I felt like I didn't have to explain myself to her, as I had laid out my issues with her then and there. She and Friend C, after a while, come to the room, and Friend F basically assaults me and nearly breaks my laptop. After crying for a few minutes, she tries to talk to me, and calls me a pussy for not being able to tell her in real life. As I try to explain to her that I wanted to sit her down and talk about it, she throws a shoe at me. Friend B, fed up, kicks her out of the room. 

Developments are still ongoing, but AITA for saying she should be kicked out.

There were a lot of time growing up where I didn't agree with her about something but was not allowed to voice that. And honestly even now, there are some of those times.

I love my mom, she's the strongest person I ever met.  But because of this I have never shared much of my personal life with her.  I try to open up more now, because I want an open relationship with her.  And, to her credit she has tried a lot harder to be less strict but she's still her own way.

Well because of this I have made it a point to involve my son in our lives as much as makes since given his age etc.  he has always been given a voice.

Okay so let's get the background over... I'm a single mother to a 5 year old boy with several allergies. Some severe and some mild.  Including an array of food allergies. My mother babysits him while I am at work.  This generally means she is feeding him about one meal a week by my request, and sometimes he gets junk or treats there too.

Well recently my mom was feeding him and the other kids (cousins) some dinner which happened to be cooked with an ingredient my son is allergic to.  It's complicated to explain the nature of that particular allergy but while he will likely not die from it, he is still usually caused a bit of discomfort when he eats it.  Hives, itchy mouth, etc.  Typically if it is cooked and he gets some, it's okay. But he has reacted to cooked too. So even though his epipen isn't for that specific food, we avoid it.  Basically he *can* eat it and not die but really shouldn't and he and I have decided together he won't. 

Well mom told him he had to eat his dinner or he was going to be in big trouble.  When he said no again she told him he was grounded from
Screens all night until he cleaned his plate.  My son's reply was ""Fine. I don't care how much trouble I'm in I am NOT eating that.  You can't make me.""

Well of course my mom was livid when I got there to get him.  And she had told me he has to apologize before he can come back.

I told her that I can't make him do that. I have taught him from day 1 that he can refuse to eat any food he's allergic to. No adult can make him poison himself. And I will 100% back that up.  

Now mom is saying we are both AH's and need to apologize to her.  That she knows which foods he is deathly allergic to and which ones are ""fine as long as he has antihistamines if he gets hives."" 

So, AITA? And was my son holey-jr?

Jimmy and Porshia met/started dating in 2012. Their relationship progressed quickly: they moved in together within a couple of months and got engaged shortly thereafter. All seemed well until Jimmy discovered that Porshia had cheated on him with multiple guys for pretty much the entirety of their relationship. They tried to reconcile, but due to further developments, split up permanently a few months later.

To provide some further background, all of Jimmy's serious relationships have ended due to his girlfriends cheating on him.

Since the breakup Jimmy has been very active on Tinder. He seems to match with girls who want more than he does. Jimmy just wants roots, he will say whatever is necessary to obtain them, and then ghosts the girl afterwards. Whenever I call him out he is pretty apathetic, he offers no defense and says that he just doesn't care about their feelings.

The whole situation is shitty because he was originally supposed to stay for 1 month and still shows no signs of leaving anytime soon, but that's a whole other ordeal. Just know that tensions between us are high.

K loves my cats, and even feeds them for me sometimes without me asking him to. I'm always grateful and thank him whenever I notice him doing it. But they can be little shits, and one of their favorite troublemaking hobbies is gallivanting through the halls of my apartment building, which, as indicated by my lease, they're not supposed to do. But sometimes they're too quick and squeeze by me before I can stop them. I don't mind it much though and I almost always catch them before they get too far down the hallway.

Now, I just started a new job yesterday morning. I haven't been feeling well and couldn't sleep much the night before, so I was exhausted that morning. K, knowing this, went out to the grocery store down the street while I was still sleeping and bought me an energy drink and a snack to get me through the day. I thought this was really sweet of him and thanked him for it several times throughout the day.

Fast forward to tonight, I'm trying to nip a potential ear infection in the bud by pouring some hydrogen peroxide in my ear. Anyone who's done this knows how unpleasant it is, and to top it off, I'm particularly squeamish about things touching or going inside my ears. K knows all this, and I was also very vocal about my discomfort while it was happening. K decides now would be a good time to tell me that one of my cats got out as he was leaving to buy those snacks for me. The cat led him on a wild goose chase throughout the building, running up and down several flights of stairs before K could catch him. I sort of half-chuckle and say, ""Yeah, he can be a shit.""

So there I am, head cocked to the side and nursing this peroxide bubbling in my ear, and K just says, rather rudely, ""You're welcome.""

I was caught off guard by that so I didn't say anything. K says, ""Wow. Really, nothing?""

Cue some bickering. I told him that I would have gone out and caught the cat myself if I knew it was happening, and also, what else was he going to do, just leave him out there? K responds, ""Just because something's common courtesy or expected doesn't mean you shouldn't still say thank you."" I'm annoyed at this point so I halfheartedly apologize but I tell him that I didn't realize a thank you was expected or necessary in this situation.

He responds, ""Whatever, it's a really minor thing anyway."" I reply, ""Yeah, it really is."" Thought it was over. He says, ""Maybe the next time you do something minor I'll just forget to thank you for it.""

Then I told him to fuck off and went to bed.

So, Reddit, AITA for not thanking him or is my friend TA for expecting a thanks?"	0	10

A decent amount of people get recruited and/or get scholarships every year. The two in question here is Jack, let's call him, who got a full ride to Oklahoma for football, and me, a recruited swimmer for Emory.

So, recently, a whole thing happened, and Jack was caught with weed in his locker. It was a big thing, and he ended up getting rescinded. 

Some of my friends asked my opinion of this, since I'm also recruited, although I didn't get a scholarship. Personally, I think he got what was coming. He always goes out, parties, drinks, and does weed pretty often. All this is common knowledge. All of this is also against the rules, but none of the students really cared.

Personally, I don't think a guy who goes out, parties all the time, and does a bunch of unhealthy shit (for being a teenager), he doesn't deserve a scholarship. That's what I told them. They all said I was being harsh. But I don't think it is. There are rules against weed, there are rules against drinking. He broke them. Those are the consequences.

I (M,33) make roughly twice as much as my GF (F,25) does in terms of take home pay. As a result I decided to pay a reasonable amount of her expenses - including 25% of her rent (I have a separate apartment which I pay for but we spend most of our time at her apartment) , her monthly phone bill, and ALL of our grocery shopping. I also take her to and from work every day, which naturally incurs some gas costs which she doesn't contribute to. Outside of her rent and occasional taxi fare ( once per week, which happens when i am working can't pick up/drop her off) she has no major obligations. I have also bought her small things on a semi- regular (almost weekly)  basis, e.g. lunch, money for going out, etc.  These costs usually add up to another 30/40 per week, .

She has a trip coming up next month that she's been planning for at least 4 months. Last week she asked me to pay 75% (instead of 25%) of the rent, as she is ""broke"" and can't afford to pay her rent and the ticket. Her ticket price is only slightly more than the money she'd be saving on the rent (roughly $800) which indicates that she hasn't saved up much towards her trip. She also says that she will pay me back within a month or two.

While I can easily cover this, I am a bit nonplussed as to why she can't afford her trip. WIBTA for asking her what happened to her money and why I need to chip in?

My brother is working on getting his license. My friend has had her learner's permit a couple times but she's working through some other stuff so it's not her top priority. My brother's at university, the same one my friend and I both graduated from.

I (23F) have a car, so whenever I do something with either of them I'm the one who drives (obviously). 

The three of us are taking a trip together, about 6 hours of driving total. My friend left some stuff with her aunt that she wants to pick up, so she asked if I could pick it up for her next time I'm there. I'm dropping my brother back at college after his spring break and I asked if she wanted to come with us.

WIBTA if I asked them to pitch in this time (and for future trips like this)? I don't want to spring an unexpected expense on them. I've never asked them for gas money before and they've never offered. Neither of them has a job and I'm working full time, which is why I'm not sure if I WBTA. But it's not a trip I would make by myself and I feel like they should be contributing in some way."	2	18

I had some Jordan 3's that my friend (I'll call them aaron) really liked and wanted.
 He came up to me at school one day asking if i would be willing to trade them for soldier 11's that he said were bought for him by his dad which he knew i loved. I told him of course and that Saturday we had traded. I come to school Monday wearing them and find out that they're actually not Aaron's shoes and are some that he borrowed from another friend(I'll call them ashley). ashley says they want their shoes back and I say that I'm willing to return them but I'll need my shoes back.
so the next day I come to school wearing different shoes with the soldiers in my backpack. I go to Aaron for the shoes and the Jordans are muddy AND THE SOLES ARE MISSING. so I say i'm not giving the soldiers back until He gets me a new pair of 3's. 
since then I have been completely shut out of the friend group and getting spammed with texts from our whole group saying that I'm a dick and that i shouldn't have traded with Aaron if i wasn't willing to risk the shoes being destroyed.
so... AITA for not giving the shoes back?

TL;DR: i trade shoes, mine get destroyed, I'm not giving theirs back"	5	14

Past couple months she would keep commenting on my stories on instagram saying that New York's so pretty that she wants to come. I was excited so she came on Wednesday night and was going to stay till Sunday.

When she came out of the Uber I was a bit disappointed. She didn't look nearly as attractive as I remember her in college, nor did she look like her instagram photos. She had put on weight and looked a lot older I don't know I was disappointed if I am being honest. But I already told her that she could stay at my place.

I decided to make the best of the time anyways. So I let her stay and we spent the entire time going around the city and fucking. I not once when she was here talked about us being a couple or becoming official.

After she left, she talked about me coming down to visit her in Atlanta. I tried to be nice saying I was busy, but she kept pushing. Eventually came out that I didn't want to date her.

(Throwaway because my real life friends know this story)

A woman in my sorority was at a fraternity house and got blackout drunk and she had paramedics called. I was the president so I get a call to come help her out. I show up and she is passed out on a couch and has clearly vomited on their floor. The paramedics say that she doesn't need to go to the ER we just need to get her home, and they ask if anyone at the frat house has a car to drive her home. The president of their house volunteers to drive her home (he was sober and he definitely wasnt forced into doing this- if they had said no I would have found someone from my house to come out and get her or just called an uber) so I help carry her out the door and he drives around from the back of the house to pick her up. As soon as we get in he starts complaining about his tire, but I dont really think much of it because I'm mostly just trying to keep her together.

The next day I hear from another woman in my house that after we left the car he basically threw a full on tantrum in our front yard, yelling at this person about how his tire popped and it's all our fault and that he demands to be compensated (I was busy trying to put the drunk girl to bed). She doesn't really know what happened so she just tells me to talk to him. I text him the next day asking what's up and he sends me the longest text I've ever received. Basically he was extremely upset about how we handled the situation, that she didnt come by to clean up the vomit the morning after, how this was a liability for their house and how he wants to see her punished. I told him that we were sending her to our standards board and that she'd likely go on social probation, but he wasn't satisfied and wanted payment and basically just to complain more. They were also the ones that got her this drunk, and later on she told me she thinks she might have been drugged, but we never confirmed this.

Then he starts telling me that she has to pay for his tire that popped, which had popped before we got in the car as he was driving out of his parking lot. I basically tell him that it's his tire, his parking lot and not her responsibility. If I was driving a friend home and my car broke down I wouldn't even think to charge them just because they were in the car. His argument was that since he was only driving his car to give her a ride home it's her responsibility. I just stop responding because it didn't seem like we're going anywhere. The next day we wake up at 7am and our house is teepeed. I've just disliked that guy ever since but avoided confrontation. 

So, basically was I the asshole for refusing to accept fault for the tire popping? I could have just told the woman she had to pay and wash my hands of the situation but it didnt seem right to me. I do feel like we should have cleaned up the vomit, I accept fault for that one."	7	7

He pretty much raised me when my dad couldn't, (he got arrested and imprisoned in Columbia for some bullshit drug charges for a few years before the incompetent legal system realized he was innocent). My uncle rarely took things seriously which is what i loved about him. He took me to strip clubs when i was 15, took me on a road trip to sketchy places across eastern europe when i was 17. Together we hitchhiked across Chile and Argentina when i was 18. We went to wild parties near home too. I had the courage to ask out my girlfriend (now engaged) because he pretty much forced me to start talking to a rally hot girl that walked across us in the bar. If you guys ever played the Uncharted game series, my uncle is basically Sully. He looks similar and his voice is similar  and his personality is too. My uncle was one of the greatest people I've ever met. I have so many good memories with him. He even joked about how his funeral should be a party and that we all should get completely wasted. He believed funerals shouldn't be so sad and gloomy, celebrate the life the dead lived not grieve over them being gone, be glad they existed. He even jokingly said that if he were to die soon (obviously he was hoping to live longer than this) he said he'd want me to propose to my gf during his funeral. I started dating her because of him and i should take it to the next step in honor with him. I honestly thought this was a fucking hilarious idea but also a way of commerotaing him so i told him i'd do it if he were to die before we were married. Unfortunately he died a month ago from a stroke that was completely unexpected and i was devastated. I tried to get my family to throw a party in his honor as he requested but nobody wanted to do it no matter how much i tried so i decided to propose to my girlfriend during his funeral. My girlfriend knew my uncle for 5 years and saw him as a father figure as well ( she didn't have one and we both started dating when we were 16) and although she didn't have prior knowledge of my proposal, she wasn't shocked by it and thought it was cute.

SO the day of the funeral comes and we all speak kind words about him. They save me to make the last speech and i go on for probably 20 minutes about how much he meant to me. At the end i said, ""in honor of my uncle, I'm proposing to my girlfriend, I had the courage to ask her out because of him and now I'm proposing to her in his honor as he requested."" My girlfriend accepted my proposal and i gave her the ring my uncle gave to my aunt (she died previously). Most of the guests were like wtf are you doing and were pretty pissed off. Nobody was happy and people were screaming at us for being disrespectful and saying that we need to learn to be more respectful. The family kicked us out and barred us from entering the dinner and other activities we had planned. Im really bummed out i missed out on it and most of my family isn't on speaking terms with me."	38	33

So for the last 4-5 years (I'm 15 for context) my maternal grandparents have been drifting away from me, for almost no reason whatsoever. They love to take my sisters places and do things with them, but I can count on one hand the amount of times i've done something fun with just me and them together. When i got to about 12 years old I began to bring things to do at their house(ipod, 3DS, books etc.) and it's been this way ever since. Bringing us to the present, we got to their house today and they didn't say a word to me. Now, this isn't completely out of the ordinary, as sometimes they won't talk to me or make any attempts at conversation, but today i was already in a bad mood for other reasons. So I decided to roll with it and not say a damn thing to them. Dinner comes and goes, with me responding to the conversation, albeit in a limited way. However, I was polite during the meal and was in no way rude towards them or anyone. When the dinner ends, my grandmother finally says to me; ""Uh, aitathrowawayyyyyy, you can help take these dishes out too."" Now this is a perfectly fine request, however I was feeling a bit pissed off seeing as these were the first words she spoke to me, so I declined and walked away.

We sat down and figured out a budget of what we could afford for rent. My friends make more than I do, and one has already paid off student loans so they felt comfortable with a max around $1150. I said my max was $1100 but readjusted and moved it down to $1000. I currently pay $800 so this would be a size-able step up for me. 

Here is where it gets complicated: one roommate works from home most of the time, and would like to have extra space for an office. So we began looking at 4 bedroom apartments and found a few that are within our budget and satisfied all of our needs. 

One place in particular was 4 bed 1 bath with a large basement and a nice porch for $3300. We would turn the 4th room into an office which I would most likely never use. 

When I discussed this with my girlfriend, she thought it was crazy that we would all pay relatively close to the same amount in rent (I’d pay $1050 and my two roommates would pay $1125 each) while one roommate basically had two rooms. She believes that the rent should be split for each room (4 ways in this case) and my roommate who needs an office should pay for both. At this rate he would have to pay $1650 total while myself and the other roommate would pay $825

I don’t know how to feel about any of this. Any help is greatly appreciated"	0	19

Nothing happened on bad terms, it was more so that it was long distance and Liz is about to make a huge career move. Jake was a lot more into her (in the love stage) than she was with him and didn’t see it as fair to him for her to continue on that way. They “talked” for about 6 months and dated for 5 or so. 

Jake is also one of my best friends, we are all in the same friend group and he lives in the city I just moved to. He and I see each other frequently because he’s one of the only people I know here and he, along with our few other friends here, hang out often. We also work a block away from each other. 

Liz knows we are still friends and says she’s okay with it but I feel like it upsets her in a sense which is completely understandable. I don’t rub it in when Jake and I are together, but if she asks I most certainly won’t lie about it either. Liz is from the city I live in now and she’s visiting this weekend. I have plans with jake on Saturday to go out with him and a few of our other friends, and told her but said I would cancel them since Liz is far more important than Jake. She’s my best friend in the entire world and I would never put anyone over her. I told her that I’d cancel if she’d like but she said not to worry about it since were hanging on Friday and I’m going to her family’s BBQ during the day Saturday. I can read her like the back of my hand though and I know she’s irritated. If I knew she was going to be coming into town I wouldn’t have made these plans but I found out 3 hours ago and my friends and jake have had these plans for over a week now. 

AITA for still being jakes friend? This situation stresses me out so much. I almost wish things ended on bad terms so I could hate him but they didn’t. I don’t know what to do either. Should I cancel on him Saturday?

He began having knee trouble as a direct result of the weight; it escalated to the point where he can't walk without pain and can no longer run (as opposed to walking, not that he was ever into running). We had to sit in a pretty tight space on an airplane recently and resulting from that he is enduring terrible pain in his hip. I believe this would not have happened were he not so overweight - granted, he's pretty tall, about six feet I think, but not enormous.

The thing is, he's never gotten serious about improving his health. He's been on a few diets that made some difference but didn't change things in the long run. He used to teach full-time and also run a business, not that we needed the extra money with my mom's good job, but just because he wanted to. He quit teaching, now runs the business full-time, plays in the worship band at church, and has his own band that does gigs locally. So in his off time, he wants to do nothing but watch television, that and read sometimes. All he does is sit on the couch. My mom and I talked to him about it but he said since walking is hard, he has to lose weight by eating healthy before starting regular exercise.

Now for the past couple days, he's been talking a lot about this new hip problem: that it's extremely painful and hard to walk, over and over. I'm getting tired of hearing it because to me it seems as if he wants sympathy. I know it is very hard for him, and that he certainly can't be called lazy in most things, but I think he's caused his own health problems. AITA?

So one day I went over to my friends house for a sleepover with her and her boyfriend. We decided to play truth or dare from some mobile app, they chose to pick the dirty version because my friends boyfriend was over and whatnot. We were put in pairs since it was like a COUPLES thing. My friend and her boyfriend were put in partners (for obvious reasons) so that left me and the brother as partners. My friend and her boyfriend end up doing things such as spanking kissing etc. while me and my friend’s brother didnt do much since i didn’t want to do anything with her brother like kiss since its her brother. Eventually we get a dare that says “makeout with your partner for 1 minute straight” and I say “Lets skip that..” then everyone starts complaining how me and the brother are only hugging and its getting boring and how i have to do it for AT LEAST 30 seconds. I stuff my face in a pillow so the brother couldn’t pull a sneaky on me or something. The brother said “just get it over with.” I hesitated but did it. It feels like its been an hour of us makingout so I stop kissing the brother and ask the boyfriend and my friend how long has passed. They dont show me the timer but instead hide it until I beg to see it. The timer said about 2:30 minutes. I was a bit mad but I let it slide. My friend was saying she “didnt care” and how it “didnt make her uncomfortable” so everything is good, right? Well she ends up telling people (even though we all swore we wouldnt tell anyone). She texted me later saying she “feels uncomfortable around me”. She said we were still friends but she just didnt wanna hangout outside of school. A day later, her boyfriend texts me saying how he also “feels uncomfortable” around me and when I asked him if hes saying this because my friend told him to (since the text sounded similar) he said no and that Im just annoying. I started crying for a while and that night I cried myself to sleep as well (the boyfriend was one of my best friends too). The next day, a close guy friend tells me how he’s jealous that I got to make-out with someone before him. He started snapping me saying he wants to do it with someone and that he doesnt want it to mean anything. At first, I suggest other girl friends of his but he rejects all of them, until he mentions me. I have a bit of a crush on him so I say yes (stupidly). He says how he wants it to be at my friends house for privacy. She says no and we end up just not doing anything. My friend tells people (again) and eventually starts talking about me in-front of my face. A person she told, WHICH WAS ALSO MY FRIEND, started calling me a hoe to my face, saying how I was going to be a teen mom at 15 and when I said “Uhh I dont really see it” she said “I definitely can” and that's just one event
Now my “friend” still talks about me constantly got rid of my highlight on instagram and also unfollowed me. She says it’s my fault. AITA? (sorry that it's kinda long)"	8	11

They've k own each other for at least 2years now but only recently really started hanging out. 

Anyways, this guy is nice, no issues really. Although, he has a lot of mental disorders such as schizophrenia. So, whenever he texts or calls my husband and sometimes doesn't get an answer right away because we also have a 2 yr old my husband cares for while I'm at work. So, when this happens his friend texts and then calls me asking if my husband is ok or if he's mad. I use to answer the first couple of times when this happened before but after awhile it's gotten a little overwhelming. 

So, AITA for ignoring this guy's texts and calls? I normally text my husband that he's asking me about him but that's about it."	4	4

He’s always been prone to get jealous around me with girls and whichever women are in our lives, either separately or together, he will get very weirdly competitive. However, for various reasons both of us have been single pringles for longer than we’ve been in relationships, but he’s honestly like a brother to me. He’s been a shoulder to cry on when my mum passed away, I helped him buy a house, he bought me my first dog, etc. 

My girlfriend Safia- I’ve known her since last November. My gym buddy had been pushing me to meet her and despite me not really wanting a gf, it happened one day and we hit it off big time. I’ve known her 6 months and I can tell you right now she’s the fucking one for me.

She is never in a million years the type of girl I’d go for. She is completely out of my league. Lip fillers, makeup obsessed, runs around making friends with cats on the street, loves pink anything, calm as anything, has a degree in biomedical science, works for an organisation that *advises the bloody NHS* and is sharply intelligent. When I introduced Dave and Saf to each other I was sure they’d love each other. But nope. Despite me thinking Safia is the most interesting fucking person to walk this earth, Dave has been nothing but hostile to her and is openly rude. She first took it well and privately I apologised profusely to her. Asked Dave wtf his issue was and he called her a bimbo, vapid, etc. 

Since then it’s progressed into him openly calling her blondie (she has dark hair), him telling me she’s after my money, him telling me that I need to break up with her because she’s only using me and someone like her would never want to be with someone like me. Safia has said literally nothing about him, and I know she has an insecure streak where she feels like people don’t like her as it is, so naturally I’ve stopped seeing Dave as much. 

He’s called me drunk last night and told me how I’ve let a ‘loose pussy get in between him and I’ ... I’m honestly done with his guy. Am I doing the right thing by severing this relationship? In the last 6 months my life has been getting better and better- and coincidentally I’ve been seeing him less and less. Him disrespecting my girlfriend is the nail in the coffin as far as I’m concerned, but my other friends think this is a classic case of me being caught up in a shiny new relationship and not seeing the bigger picture."	5671	777

She broke up with me in the coldest, toxic way ever. She told me that she never cared for me and wants to date people closer to her. I wished her the best then blocked her everywhere.

Last week on Wednesday, one of my close friends asked if me and my ex was together (At that time we was two weeks in the breakup). I told him that I blocked her everywhere and I didn’t like the energy she gave during the breakup. He informed that not even two weeks into the breakup, my ex found his Instagram and texted him.

I let him know to not mess with her because she’s toxic and she’s not worth the trouble. She’s just either looking for a rebound or trying to start some drama. He told me that he wasn’t going to talk to her and we shook on it. I told him that he wouldn’t like it if one of his friends tried to mess with his ex after they breakup. He empathized with me and told me that he understands.

So today, my cousin told me out of nowhere that he knows what my ex looks like. I was confused about at what he meant. Then he told me everything my close friend told him.

He showed him a video of my ex, he told him that they’re just “texting”, he doesn’t care about his ex because he nutted on her so he marked his territory, and he doesn’t understand why I still care about my ex...

He told my cousin that he’s going to shoot his shot at my ex once I graduate and try to fuck her.

That completely shocked me...I actually gave the guy advice with his relationship, didn’t clown him like his other friends did when he lost his girl, and this how he’s going to treat me?

I thought about cutting him off, but I’m thinking that it’s kinda “asshole-ish” since she’s my ex and has no purpose in my life anymore."	1	6

I was dropped off at the airport by my SO so I need someone to pick me up, and he offered.


Before my trip, I emailed him my flight information. During my trip I took a screenshot of my flight information and texted it to him a couple of days before I needed to fly back home. 


It's the night before I fly out around noon the next day, and he asks me when and where he needs to pick me up. I tell him my phone is dying, and we are still out. I tell him to look it up. (Remember I've emailed and texted him the flight information. He has the airline and flight number. And he knows the time which tells me he referenced the photo I previously sent him.) 


He tells me no, that's my job since he's the one doing me the favor. I tell him I'm out and about with a dying phone and he can either look it up or wait. (Texted him the old screenshot so he knows the airport and time, but that's not enough info apparently.)


I proceed to get upset, because I feel like I've given him plenty of info. Everytime I pick someone up. I follow the signs that match the flight info given to me. I honestly don't know what additional information I can give him at this point.


Unfortunately he calls me a dick/asshole and I call him childish for having to look shit up for him that's a quick Google. I tell him I'll just have someone else pick me up that knows the information better, but hes adamant about picking me up if only I give him the when and where.


I finally get to the place I'm staying, hook my phone up to charge and Google it. Unfortunately it's not the clearest answer due to the fact that it could change with a delay or change in flight. I give him my best guess and tell him that I'm not 100% positive since I normally just go to the airport and follow the prompts and use the flight number in case there's a dramatic change in termibal/gate. I text him a screenshot of the most recent info again.


In the end I'm still upset that I had to look this information up for him. The info I texted him included the airport, airline, flight number, time, gate I was arriving at, but was missing a clear and distinct terminal. But based on my memory from when he dropped me off it's pretty self explanatory once you're on the ground, but a tad harder when looking at the website. He did not accept my answer of follow the prompts at the airport. 


He's upset that I cant give him the information and calling him childish for not even trying to Google it while I'm with my family.


I will admit I was being a tad of a dick with how I was telling him to look it up once he started to push back on the matter. But am I the asshole for being upset that he couldn't even take the time to look up any additional information given the information I had already provided?"	5	24

Ryan (not his real name) is one of my new friends. He's a really great guy and lives next door at my apartment complex and he's living his life like a hippie. He says he does not really relate to hippie lifestyle but he loves being free to do whatever he wants to do. He told me he decided to live like that after years of struggling with depression after his mother passed away years ago.

He smokes crack all day and barely takes a shower. His body stinks so bad but I did not want to hurt his feelings so I never made a fuss about it.
Ryan has introduced me to some of his friends and they always invite me to join them whenever they're hanging out or visiting the beach etc.

2 days ago we went to the beach in my car. It was past midday when we drove home and as it was getting really hot, Ryan started to stink really bad. But apparently nobody paid attention to it. The smell lingered in my car after they left, even after I deodorized it. And it kind of pissed me off. I did not want to hummiliate him in front of his friends, so I only talked to him about it later that night. 
I said casually ""Hey buddy. I don't want to sound rude or anything. But you're my good friend and I just want to help.""
Then I gave him a roll-on.

He got really pissed and looked rather offended and he even told me if his body odor bothered me so much then maybe we should no longer be friends and then asked me to leave him alone.

I talked to one of his friends that I have a crush on about it later and she was so horrified. I told her as a friend I only worried about his personal hygiene, nothing else. But apparently she did not share the same opinion about it. She said that's just how Ryan is. And I should have been more sensitive and asked the other kids' opinion first on how to approach him about it without offending him since they have known him longer than me.

So I said ""So nobody has ever told him that he stinks?""
She said ""We've been friends with him for many years. He's always had problems with his low self-esteem and we did not want to hurt him. He's our good friend and we love him the way he is. That's such a dick move from you!""

By the title, automatically you'd say that I'm the ass hole. And honestly, I agree. I just want to know how much of an asshole would I be if I did this. 

I'm obsessed with Harry Potter. I'm a stereotypical Hufflepuff, but I'm also very Petty. With that being said, let's get into the situation. 

So, last Christmas, my mom got me a Hufflepuff shirt. It kinda looks like a Jersey. If you shop at torrid, then you might know what I'm talking about. It automatically became my favorite peice of clothing. Three months ago, however, it came up missing. I remember I took it off so that I wouldn't ruin it while I helped my mom paint our spare room. I put it on our bar and basically forgot about it as I had to go straight to work after I finished helping my mom (I clean the office my mom works at after it closes, so paint splattered clothes aren't inappropriate). I come home and see that my shirt, along with all of the sweaters that were also on the bar, were gone. That's normal though. Someone will usually gather the sweaters and any other loose article of clothing around the house and wash them. When the sweaters were done, I went to grab my shirt but it wasn't there. I've looked everywhere for this shirt. I've even cleaned the whole house spotless trying to find it. I asked my mom and BOTH of my sisters if they've seen it. They all say no. That was about three months ago. 

Last week, I watched as my sister (Yes. Elizabeth from my other stories) bring down a basket of her laundry when I spot a familier shade of yellow inside the basket. I've NEVER seen her wear anything in that color. I felt in my gut that it was my Hufflepuff shirt, but I didn't confront her. I was tired, I had a toothache and I just really didn't want to fight with her at that moment. I decided to bide my time. 

Well, yesterday was her birthday, so today, my other sister took her and her boyfriend to Seattle for a concert. They don't come home until Saturday, so I took the opportunity to search Elizabeth's room. And low and behold, I found my Hufflepuff shirt, folded neatly in the bottom of her laundry basket, buried under the rest of her clothes. I also found a flower hair clip I got to wear to my prom four years ago. It was only like, $2 but I found it after I found my shirt, so I was pretty pissed. I'm going to spend the next two days going through her mountain of stuff to find two other things of mine that I've been missing for YEARS. A Fairy Tail necklace and my FAVORITE Beatles shirt (I tried to replace that one, but the only one I can find is on eBay and it's not even in my size. I'm starting to think that shirt was a rare one, so I'm extra pissed at that).

What I really want to do is wear my Hufflepuff shirt on Saturday so that Elizabeth sees me wearing it when she gets home and so that I could see her reaction. You know, whether she'll apologize or not, if she'll be pissed, if she'll claim that this one is HERS and that I must have lost mine, etc. How much of an asshole would I be if I did that?"	2	11

I had told them that as long as they work fine, I would pay them some money afterwards for the speakers. 

We all graduated recently, and I didn’t have space for them in my car. Therefore, some friends put the speakers in a friends house, and I picked them up about 3 weeks afterwards. 

I got home to use them and one of the subwoofers did not work, and one of the other speakers lights did not work. Furthermore, the remote was missing which has functionalities that you can only do on the remote. 

The speaker set when we first bought them included 2 large subwoofers, 2 normal speakers, a receiver/amplifier, and a remote. 

They didn’t reach out to me for payment, but I texted them offering 125 for the speakers. 

They believe that I should pay more for the speakers because they worked in our basement at college and it’s not their fault they don’t work now. 

I mentioned that i wouldn’t want to buy it for much more. They said that they wouldn’t have agreed to buy the speakers in the first place if I hadn’t agreed to buy it back from them. 

Am I the asshole?

[Edit] me and my 5 roommates split the 375 originally. To make sure I include their side, the arguments are that the speakers worked in our basement during college. We’re not sure when they broke (movement to friends house, movement to my car, movement to my house). 

They also don’t think the damages amount to $200. I don’t either but they’re 2 years old heavily used speakers now. 

They also say that I can just buy a remote on amazon and get the subwoofer fixed. 

We’re gonna discuss it after work today."	5	20

We live together	https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/cdcf83/aita_for_interacting_as_little_as_possible_with/	"I (24F) really don't like my BIL(24M). I currently live with him. My partner (29F) / his sister / my girlfriend (will refer to her as GF for rest of post) and I wanted to move out on our own however realized it'd be a better idea to have roommates and split the rent (we each pay $600) due to me being in school this year and so saving where we can. 

We've been living all together just under two months. At first I attributed all the little things he did to ""settling in"", such as: not cleaning up after himself in the kitchen, leaving beard clippings in the bathroom sink, leaving front door partially locked, etc. Then he'd ask to borrow things and they'd be broken/not in the state we handed them to him (umbrella, bikes,etc). 

I was never the one to tell him these things/ ask him to clean up after himself my very patient girlfriend did. So he has his little anger fit with her and then forget it and next thing you know they're hanging out together. Like it was NBD, which is what I expect from siblings. 

I then had a spat with my BIL over the way he spoke to me. Not cursing or anything just very rude/petty over something I saw as minimal and he clearly didn't. That resulted in me understanding he's not someone I'd feel comfortable expressing feelings to as he doesn't care how someone else takes what he says. I have a hard time forgetting things and how they made me feel so while it may not be at the forefront of his mind, it is mine. 

He's pretty much a very outspoken person who has an opinion about everything and I can't formulate exactly what moment made me dislike him. Just a plethora of things like leaving the sandwich grill on all day, leaving the oven on, leaving coffee grounds all over the counter, not cleaning said coffee machine after use, being genuinely careless (will use a hand towel and let it fall to the ground bc he doesn't look back). Ignoring things we wrote into our roommate agreement bc it's convenient. The latest is this reptile he has. I find them disgusting, didn't think I'd see much of it since it's in his room but now BIL has taken to putting the thing on our plants in living room to let it get air. Makes my skin crawl whenever it's out. 

Now since then, I only speak to him if I have to or if he's spoken to me. If we're all in the living room typically it's BIL talking to my GF and me nodding or just not engaging with them, again unless needed to. I'm not rude towards him in any way. He has redeeming qualities.. just not enough of them. 

My GF recently told me she's sad I don't talk to him. And I get that. This is the girl I'd like to marry someday. He's her brother. I can't get myself to like him. It's shit for all involved. I feel like an asshole and I remind myself there are 10 more months until this lease is over. Idk what to do. Fake smile? Pretend I don't see how careless he is? Drink every moment I'm home? Idk.

His girlfriend Jane (fake name) is super overbearing, jealous, insecure, and basically has him on a leash. 

John used to be my absolute best friend, but he drifted away from me, and i often asked why. he always just said he was busy, but he eventually told me Jane didn’t like him talking to me. i was shocked! i’ve never been anything other than nice to Jane and don’t understand why she would not want me to talk to him. 

For over a year (how long they’ve been together) John has been distant from me. we went from talking everyday to talking once every few months, and even then it was just a few words in passing.  

a few weeks ago i went out to eat with my grandmother at a local diner. unbeknownst to me, John now works there. i realized this when he handed me and my grandmother my food. didn’t say hello, didn’t say a word to me. just handed me my food and left back to the kitchen. this absolutely crushed me, so i (stupidly) posted on my private snap chat story (which he is on still) “crazy when 2 people go from best friends to strangers”. 

John saw this post, asked if it was about him and i confirmed. we had a short awkward conversation of me telling him i didn’t want to talk to him if Jane would be mad at him. (Jane has broken up with John before because he texted me. her hate towards me is that deep.)
today, i get a snapchat notification that John has taken a screenshot of something. i am confused because i didn’t send him anything, and see he screenshotted chat. i send a ? and he leaves me on read. i automatically KNOW that this is Jane, but i let it go.

a few hours later she sends me a message cursing and yelling about how it’s disrespectful for me to post something like that and then guilt trip him for not talking to me (which i didn’t guilt trip him) and we have basically had a 2-3 hour conversation over text consisting of her saying she doesn’t like me and i shouldn’t be worried about whether he texts me because “best friends don’t have to talk to each other”.  

i explained that he doesn’t text me because of her, and she denies it all saying it’s his choice, even when he has told me differently in person and text. 

she continues on berating me, and i just took it all. she finally got under my skin and i told her she has hurt him so much and he’s told me all about it, then she says she’s never hurt John and never would.

i told her that she is controlling and not trusting John by limiting his communications with his female friends. John has told me (on the one rare occasion that he talked to me for more than 15 seconds) that he wanted to break up with Jane but couldn’t bring himself to do it.  AITA?"	3	20

He payed €100 and said he’d get the rest soon and then he was leaving for America so he left €100 in his house for me because I kept bringing it up knowing he was leaving. He got rejected at customs for working illegally last year and they figured it out he lost €600 on flights and more in hotel and travel costs.

So my parents are getting a bit sick of me doing the same things every day (eat, sleep, play games, clean house, learn some stuff). I also am not the best at paying attention and thinking about things ahead of time or even just thinking my interests and discovering new things and answers to my questions, so they want me to watch Band of Brothers (**this is important.**) Now I don’t mean any hate to the show but I’m generally not interested in regular TV and am more of an anime fan, yet they are forcing me to watch it to “practice processing information and thinking about it”. I’m just confused because my father watches anime too but never bound to think about it for himself, while I think about what anime I watch and thus know information about particular things in said shows (characters, episode plots, etc)

I felt awful at first but my friends told me I did nothing wrong, but now I come to reddit because I still feel uneasy about the whole situation and wonder what could've changed had I gotten involved. 

I drove to my local 7-11 (convenience store for those who don't know), parked my car, and began to walk towards the store. Nearing the entrance, an ""older"" lady approached me. She was maybe around 50, had somewhat of a limp/hobble in her step, and she had a small bag of snacks, soda, pretty much just junk food. She put her hand my on shoulder and asked me if I would be able to drive her a few blocks back to her home, pointing in the direction. I told her I'm sorry but that was in opposite direction of the way I would be going so I wouldn't, but since there were at least 10 other cars in the parking lot I figured she could have asked one of them. After telling her, she mumbled something along the lines of ""respect your elders, I can barely walk"", but by now I was on my way into the store. I felt a little bad but I got my things quickly, so if she was still out there I would have said I would drive her. Upon leaving, I look for her and see she began walking and she made it across the street. I felt bad but again, there were many others she could have asked. I walk back to my car, turn it on, look out the window and see that the woman had collapsed onto the sidewalk in that short time frame. I did not see what happened, one second she is walking, the next she is on her side. I grab my phone and begin to dial 911, connect with an operator and state what I just saw, operator tells me an ambulance is already en route. Within the next minute the ambulance arrives. My dilemma here is could I have prevented this by driving her? I have so many questions, like if I drove her home would this have still happened but in my car? in her home, potentially by herself?

I obviously agreed because I love the guy to death but, I very clearly laid down three rules(which one isvincluded in our lease agreement) . The first house rule was to obviously have common courtesy and clean up after yourself. The second was to not smoke pot inside the apartment(totally fine on the deck), the final rule was to make sure to buy your own groceries and to just ask if you needed a helping hand if he ended up not buying enough groceries.

It's now been 7 months of living together, he has disregarded everything I set in stone 7 months ago. He has not cleaned a single time, I do his laundry, i do his dishes, i do his house chores, i buy his groceries. You may ask why i did all of this. I went through a very bad state when i was younger with depression. Him being my best friend all I wanted to do was make his life a little easier.

I finally confronted him last night about everything and told him I cant keep taking care of him as if he was my own child. That hes a grown man and needs to stop his bad habits of leeching/stealing off us because it isnt fair to me or my SO. He did not say a word and proceeded to storm off slamming every door on his way out. I went to the deck and asked why he was acting like this to which he responded ""You're a terrible friend, what about how I feel?""

Later that night he messaged me saying he could not believe me and that he cant believe he called me his friend. I politely explained how me and my SO purchased a vehicle recently so we cant afford to carry his weight anymore and he needs to contribute by doing his share of house work and buying his own food, his response was if I just asked him to do his part this wouldnt be an issue., I tried to explained its just kind of common knowledge and common courtesy to cleanup after yourself, do your own laundry,chores etc. I then offered him a ride to the grocery store.  To which he replied that I dont know him it all and that I'm a shitty friend and a horrible person. Which I then just said goodnight to him. 

I know. I should've brought this up months ago but I just had pity for the guy.

The perfumes and body washes I've usually purchased myself, but the lotions and hand soaps make me break out in a rash so I don't use them; they're usually bought for me for my birthday or Christmas. 

I've used the same scent for a few years and I always told myself, ""Once you run out, let's try a different scent,"" but I never do. 

Yesterday, after going to my local store and buying my usual scent, I made the decision to finally sell the stuff that I have piled up. I purchased two body washes a perfume under the stores current sale of buy two, get one free. 

I posted my haul of items on my local Facebook yardsale page at half their retail price. Bath and Body Works usually sells the items I had in my collection between $8 and $14, so of course my prices ran between $4 and $7. Many of these items were discontinued scents that were either now sold as online exclusives or weren't able for purchase through the company anymore. 

I had gotten quite a few responses, but a lady posted on my listing about an hour later saying that she didn't pay more than $3 per item online. I check online, trying to figure out what she was talking about and the only thing I could find close to this sale she was talking about were some shea butter body washes, which I wasn't selling, especially not in the scents I had. 

I mentioned to her I didn't see what she was talking about when other ladies were popping up, sending me messages asking for me to sell to them for that price, but when I mentioned I looked through the website for each scent that Bath and Body Works still carried under their ""Retired"" collection, they were all full price. After explaining, I politely asked that if they had proof of it being that price, I'd reconsider. 

I ended up getting cussed out a while ago because I wouldn't sell something for a lot less than I'd paid for it because of this supposed sale that the first lady mentioned. I did ask the angry lady for proof and she proceeded to call me a bitch and I was ripping people off. 

A thread has spawned from the first ladies comment where people are essentially trying to bully me into selling for less when they're already a steal. 

I did post a comment that said:

It must just be an online exclusive thing because I paid full price in store for two body washes and got a perfume for free (buy 2, get 1 deal). Some body washes are on sale online, but none of the ones I'm selling attribute to that list and I'm also not the online retailer, or affiliated with bath and body works; I'm just a person trying to get rid of the tons extra that I bought and never used, which is why so many of them are discontinued scents. It's not my intention to sound rude, but this is a yardsale page; I shouldn't be expected to sell items I bought with my own money at the retailer's sale prices.

I'm going to keep details pretty light because he browses this sub frequently.

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend had a dog that was 16 (from what he told me at least). I loved this dog beyond words, let me make that absolutely clear. This dog was an absolute gift to the world and I loved them unconditionally. They were 16 though and had countless medical problems (rotated front legs which prevented them from getting up, jumping up, being moved, just completely unable to walk among other things). This dog was in CONSTANT agony. Every time the dog tried to get up he would be screaming in pain. There's nothing the vets can do.

&amp;#x200B;

The vets advised that I put his dog down. I thought about it for a week and decided that I had to. This dog was suffering so much. The quality of life just wasn't there. My boyfriend went out on Friday with some of his mates and I called him to let him know I was putting his dog down. I had his dog put down at home with his family. I was sick of watching my boyfriend dismiss the pain this dog was obviously in; he ignored vets telling him to get this dog put down because it was borderline abuse keeping him alive.

&amp;#x200B;

I wish my boyfriend was there to say goodbye to his best friend, but he wouldn't of let me go through with it. He rushed home, saw his dead dog and packed up all my stuff. I've been living with my Dad for the last few days.

Now I know as an adult I'm not entitled to do anything, but I'd say most people across the world believe that, even if not obligated, you should do the most to help your family, and in many cases your friends if at all reasonably possible. I feel the same way.

Yesterday as I was preparing to return home after vacationing for over a week with my family. My car had gotten very dirty at the beach an coastal city I visited, and upon returning to my parent's mountain home I had thoroughly cleaned a detailed my car, as well as reorganized my trunk space and put my cargo cover back in, it was about as pristine as a high mileage car like it could be. However as I prepared to leave, later than I had initially planned, my parents asked me to take an old, dirty bike down to the city with me. My brother was set to move into his new college apartment the next week and they wanted it repaired so he could use it to commute. 

I told them I didn't want it in my car, and that since my car was a compact it would be difficult and possibly scratch the interior. Not to mention the cleaning and organization I had done would be null and void. I offered to let them put it on a rack instead, but they fought back saying they didn't have a lock. I park in a secure deck, and I work in a small office where I can literally walk 5 steps out the back entrance to my car, however they weren't down for this. I also offered to buy a lock and have them pay me back, which they also refused saying that my brother wanted to pick it out. (I doubt he would've cared but he wasn't present for this conversation) 

Essentially, outside of disrespecting their wishes or risking theft, the only option for me was to take the bike down on the rack, bring it inside, once again, despite a secure parking garage, and then get up very early before work to take it to the shop in the morning. The shop being on the literal opposite side of the city from me, easily 30 mins from my apartment and then an additional 45-1hr to work from there during rush hour, which would have been the only time possible. This all on the Monday after having a week off for vacation. (Gotta catch up with work, run errands, etc)

My dad called me selfish, and my mom told me she was ""dissapointed"" probably the worst thing a mama's boy can hear. They have a car that can fit a bike, and he might be without it the first couple days of school. Considering all I've said above, am I the asshole?"	6	15

So I've (22F) been seeing this guy (22M) for about 6 months now, official for 2. Lately he's started to suspect me of cheating because I'm unavailable to hang out Tuesdays and Thursdays. I'm not cheating, I just have krav maga those nights and don't want to tell him.

Bit of backstory, when I was a teenager my mum's friend told me about some story she read on the internet about a woman who took self defense, but didn't tell her new partners. She wanted to keep is as a kind of secret weapon, just in case. And apparently it paid off one day. The guy attacked her, and she beat the crap out of him. (keep in mind, this is all some internet story). My mum's friend went on about how it's good that women kept it a secret, because the guy might've attacked her with a weapon instead. Anyway, for whatever reason this really stuck with me, so I started doing krav and never told anyone. No one knows I do krav, except my krav friends.

So the guy I've been seeing is great, and it seems really promising. But I've only known him for 6 months, which I think isn't that long. I really like him, but I dunno. I've only known him for 6 months. And it's not just him I'm keeping this a secret from. It's everyone. 

But yeah. Recently he's noticed I can never hang out on krav nights, and that I never answer my phone between certain times. He asked me if I'm cheating, to which I said no. He got upset, said he didn't believe me and went home.

The thing is, I like having my ""secret weapon"". I'm fairly confident this guy isn't abusive, but people surprise the shit out of you. AITA for not telling him about my krav? I realize this may damage the relationship, but that's not what I'm asking. AITA for just having a secret/something that is mine?"	76	144

I wouldn’t say I’m the closest to some of them but to others, I’d regard myself as pretty close. So my friend( that I’m not too close to) had her birthday coming up(let’s call her Chloe). Days leading up to it, I went out for a movie with a couple of my old friends. Now, one of my friends that I’m ‘close’ to(let’s call him rush) hasn’t watched said movie, so I invited him to watch it with my other fiends that he doesn’t know. Because of this, I sat away from my group to make sure that he wasn’t alone. When we got to the venue, he said he needed to get a gift for HIS friend.Ok, I thought. We went into the store and the gift he was picking out was so obviously for Chloe. When I said it, he was like yeah how u know. I went on to say yeah I vaguely remember her saying there MIGHT be a party but probably not gonna happen( he was like ‘haha yeah’). Ok whatever. Another thing to note, during this time, I felt super depressed and lonely and I made it known to my other friend( Aly). The day comes, i see their Instagram stories, they went to the party, unbeknownst to me. After all that, obviously I felt like shit. Aly tries to talk to me like normal and I give her super neutral and short answers in which she gets angry at me for( left me on read too). Rush asked me to hang out as well and I also acted cold to him.  Now the thing is, even with me acting all cold, they don’t see anything wrong that they did so it’s making me doubt my judgement and maybe I’m just being petty. So AITA?

Side note: I wouldn’t have cared about not getting invited, I’m just pissed that they didnt even say anything to me. And I thought that I was more their friend than hers

I for the most part plan to stay in, but would i be the asshole to my hotel neighbors if i left him a lone for an hour or two at most knowing full well he will be meowing most if not the entire time.	2	16

We ordered hot chocolate and fries. There was a couple who had been sitting at the place where we sat before and they had ordered a water bottle. Generally water bottles are plastic and people just throw it away, but this particular bottle was a glass one and it had a really fancy design. It's one of those bottles that is made so that people can reuse it after buying instead of just reusing it. But this couple probably not being bothered by it had just left it on the table. My girlfriend who saw this was really fixated on this especially because it was really pretty and also environmental friendly. But we were paranoid about it and we left it as it was. Once we finished our food realizing no one came back for the bottle and the staff in the restaurant also not being bothered about it I slipped the bottle in my girlfriends bag and later told her that I took it. She was not worried and tbh she was also glad I took it instead of someone just throwing it away. But after coming home I feel pretty guilty. AMTA?	2	23

Josh is a pretty decent kid, can be a bit annoying at times but overall he's alright. His parents, however, treat him horribly. They give him shit for literally whatever he does, yell at him and call him names all the time, sometimes even straight-up bullying him.

I can just sense the anxiety that he has when his parents are around. His changes in behaviour when they are there vs when they aren't are huge. He's normally a pretty curious and talkative kid but, as soon as his parents are around, he won't do or say anything out of fear of getting yelled at. He just sits somewhere and only talks when talked to, and somehow even then his parents find reasons to fuck him over. They go on for minutes telling him what a failure he is and all of the things they don't like about him(again, in full view of other members of the family, can't even imagine how humiliating that is).

Also, my aunt and uncle have another kid. A 7 y/o which I'll refer to as Max*. Max is the biggest fucking brat I've ever seen. His parents let him do whatever he wants. That kid cannot behave at all. Also he constantly gets Josh in trouble, mostly for things he didn't even do. I remember one time they were over at our place and I didn't feel like hanging out with the adults in the dining room, so I was just chilling with my sister and my cousins in my room. Josh asked if he can play on my computer and I let him. At some point, Max leaves the room and 20 seconds later my aunts storms in and starts yelling at Josh ""WHY THE HELL DID YOU HIT YOUR BROTHER?"". I calmly told her that Max is lying and Josh was just playing on my laptop, not even looking at his brother, all while Max was sitting there with a big grin of satisfaction on his face.


As a former abused child(although nowhere close to this level, thank God), I can't help but empathize with this poor kid. I want to do something for him, but I just can't. It boils my blood every time they treat him the way they do and I want to stand up for him and tell my uncle and aunt they are treating him horribly, but there's a big issue. Where I come from, the generation gap is taken VERY seriously and I would just be told that I'm a stupid kid(I'm 22, but whatever) and I am in no position to tell them how to raise their kids, and I know that the rest of my family wouldn't back me up, even though they all kind of agree they are horrible to him(another thing that I hate about my culture, everyone agrees when something isn't right but no one would do anything to change it). Also child protective services are absolutely fucking useless here.

I feel like an asshole for this. By not taking attitude, I'm an accomplice to my cousin's abuse. This kid will for sure develop mental disorders later in life because of this, and I can't help but think that I can take a part of the blame.

*Yeah, I know, I'm not very creative with names."	19	30

We dated for around three weeks but realized we were more friends than an actual couple. So the breakup was mutual and we carried on like nothing happened. Like after the breakup, we still talked on a regular basis, I still tell him things that only he only knows, we play minecraft all the time together and we hang out frequently. I consider my ex as one of, if not my best friends, of course a lot of people may think we're dating but I already have a new boyfriend (17M). Now my current boyfriend, is very jealous and clingy. He doesn't like the fact I hang him out with him and still talk to him. But it's not like I ignore my boyfriend in favor of my ex, I give him priority always. But sometimes I want to hangout with my friends, including my ex over him sometimes. It's not like we have to talk 24/7. He always ditches me to hang out with his friends so I don't see the problem. I still like my boyfriend a lot and he means a lot to me.

Now not many people know this, but my homelife is bad because my parents are alcoholics and it stresses me out. They get drunk frequently and the environment in the house causes me to have panic attacks and severe anxiety. They don't hurt me physically, but the mental games they play with me are awful. The only people who know about my homelife and mental issues of course are my boyfriend, and my ex. This comes into play because last night, I started having panic attacks. Really bad ones where I couldn't breathe. It was only 7pm so I call my boyfriend to please come pick me up, but he hangs up on me and texts me, ""what?"". I tell him that I'm having another panic attack and if he could come pick me up. (This is the first time I've ever asked him to do this btw). He tells me to just deal with it and that he's busy watching the football game at school with friends. Okay fine whatever, I call up my ex and he answers, agrees to make the 20 minute drive to my house and picks me up.

My ex takes me to get some fast food as we make it back to his house so I can recuperate. His parents know me very well and are happy to see me and said that I can stay as long as I needed. My ex lets me sleep in his room and he sleeps on the couch. In the morning I'm talking to my ex when I get an angry call from my boyfriend. He calls me a cheater and starts accusing me of still having feelings for my ex, he also said that he will fight my ex and that he's coming to pick me up at 2pm. He then hangs up on me. My ex who heard everything told me he sounds dangerous and that he won't let me go with him. But I get why my boyfriend would be mad. I feel like I shouldn't have gone to my ex's house of all people knowing how it makes my boyfriend feel, I think I should've just dealt with it. AITA? My ex told me that IATA for dating this guy and putting up with him."	1	10

I don't mind the emails, but due to the volume I tend to mostly ignore them. Sometimes if people write a particularly nice email, or if they are very persistent, I will email them 'thanks but no thanks'. 

At the time of the incident, one particular recruitment consultant had been contacting me over and over again by email (personal and work) and on LinkedIn. The emails themselves were starting to grate, as IMO they were quite unprofessional - very informal/overly friendly, grammatically poor and full of smiley/winky emoticons. After 4 or 5 contacts, I politely explained I was not interested. The emails continued. I tried again a couple of weeks later, asking him to please stop contacting me, and this time I immediately got a response along the lines of 'are you sure?' and 'just let me know if I'm bothering you, I'd hate to be that annoying person who doesn't know when to stop 😉'. 

At this point I lost my temper a bit. I replied and told him in no uncertain terms to never contact me again, and also explained that, even if I were looking for a change, I would be unlikely to use him because of the general tone, sentence construction and use of emoticons in his email. I also made some suggestions as to how he could improve his emails.

He replied straight away apologising, saying that often people like the friendly nature of his emails, and was so nice about it that I immediately felt like a massive asshole. So - AITA?"	1	5

They cause me to have severe anxiety and provoke a fight or flight reaction from me. I’ve been this way all my life. I’m 40 years old and I’ve only just become more comfortable with telling people about this. 

A few weeks ago, a friend of mine and I went out to eat. After we were done, we both grabbed mints on our way out. I put mine in my mouth (my own noises don’t bother me), but I told him I’d appreciate if he waited until after we got back to my place. He looked at me like I was being incredibly rude. But I tried to remind him of my condition and he seemed like he didn’t understand (this is common for people that don’t understand that this condition goes beyond mere annoyance). 

I felt like a complete jerk for asking and the ride home felt awkward like I pissed him off. It’s causing me to rethink how I engage with others when it comes to this. 

Another example is that I occasionally have fights with my SO because of the stares I give him when he eats loudly. I often have to leave the room which makes him more angry. 

Anyhow, am I the asshole here?

Edit - I understand that I’m probably the asshole for eating the mint, but some of you are being incredibly mean to me based on the misophonia. Please understand that I don’t need to know if you’d be my friend or not. Please just judge me on the incident that I posted.

Edit 2 - I have accepted that I’m the asshole for eating the mint. Message loud and clear. Thanks for being honest with me!

UPDATE — After making this post, I chatted with the friend tonight to see his point of view. He said he wasn’t offended by me eating the mint and he wasn’t pissed off, but that he was initially surprised by my question because he forgot about it. He and I are really close friends and for these types of things it’s usually water off a ducks back, so I apologized how I handled it either way and we left it at that. 

My friends are usually very supportive when it comes to this or any condition or ailment I may have. I make sure that I do the same for them. So I messed up that night by eating a mint. It was a mistake and nothing that a friend of mine would unfriend me over (as some of you suggested meh)."	10	55

My apartment has a small balcony, which is directly above the patio of the lower apartment. This means that nearly every time I want to use my balcony, I have to smell what they're smoking. Sometimes I like leaving the screen door open for air, but I can't do that either. I'm sensitive to the smell.

It's important to note that the entire building is a non-smoking building, there are designated smoking areas outside the building, and weed is not legal in my state. I've complained to the landlord multiple times but nothing's happened.

Sometimes when I'm outside and I hear them come out and light up, I just want to scream. They'd be able to hear me, so I usually want to just cry HEY ASSHOLE STOP FUCKING UP MY BALCONY WITH YOUR SHITTY SMELLING SMOKE

but I do not do anything. I can feel myself reaching a breaking point, so if I just suddenly scream at them with really no prior interaction (from their point of view) would I be the asshole?

 Whilst at university I worked every weekend and saved. When I finished university I used some of the money to go abroad and travel for 6 months.

When I returned in around 2015  I got a job, did a room share for cheap rent, got a second job on weekends (now working 7 days a week) and also did extra jobs fixing up and selling things on. By doing all this I was able to save fast and after 2 years I bought a 1 bed flat in 2017, just before this i got a better job (£40k increasing to 45k over a few years) and quit my other jobs so I was then just working 5 days a week. I also put away about 8k a year of my income towards my pension as I want to have a comfortable life when I'm older. I have continued to do side work since and spend probably 10-15 hours a week doing this.
I'm also doing additional training and working hard towards a promotion.


background on my gf (29f)

We met in 2016, we were together a year before I bought the flat, we were both involved in the decision of the area as we intended to live together and so I wanted her to be included. She wanted to go travelling and so quit her job and went away for about 6 months at the time I moved, we stayed together and she accrued about 5k in debt. On returning from travelling she came to live with me as we planned, and when she got a job we agreed she would pay me £200 per month towards bills. She got a job in the charity sector where she earns £19k. She has spent the past 18 months paying off her debt and is now debt free. She has a degree and has the experience and ability to get a well paying job. She In fact had an interview for a job that would pay more than me but did not go. she said she wants to work in the charity sector and despite not getting paid much, the money does not matter as much to her as helping others working for a charity. I have always supported her with her choices. She is also wanting to go away for a further 6 month period at some point to do voluntary work.

The situation now

We both love travelling and go away a few times a year, we have talked about getting married one day and starting a family and are about to start saving for a house together. 

AITA If I say that if she wants to continue working in her job then I will support her, but when the financial responsibility of a house and a family comes she is going to struggle. And without putting money away she will either have little money on retirement or have to work.

AITA for assuming we will be splitting all bills and financial commitments 50/50?
 
In my eyes I work hard for my money, and have made sacrifices in order to get financially ahead. My girlfriend has not and despite having the ability to earn what I do choses not to. Whilst I respect that decision should it not be her that struggles financially because of this, or am I expected to bear the financial burden of her choices?

Edit: to clarify if we had children I would be more than happy to take full financial responsibility whilst she was not working. Or if she became ill and couldn't work or something unforseen happened and I would be happy to take the financial burden in this case. It's the current case where she is choosing her job where I am wanting to do a 5050 split



Edit:

Thankyou for some of your comments. Some have been very helpful and I have not been able to comment on all the helpful ones so I apologise for that. After seeing some of these I changed my way of thinking so that an equitable share would in my view be fair and reasonable.

I think there is some misunderstanding. We currently and always have split things 50/50. My gf has never had an issue with this and we have never argued about money. My title was poorly worded and i have not spoken to her about this before now. I am just thinking longer term as we want to save for a house etc. Also some people seem to think I would be buying a house she could not afford, it was always the intention to buy a house where we could each afford the payments. 

I have sat down with my girlfriend and talked about this now, at first she was surprised as she always imagined us doing things 50/50. Saying it has not crossed her mind to do anything else. When we discussed the bigger financial commitment and the bigger capacity of mine to pay more towards bills we both agreed that an equitable bill share is fair.

 talking about issues like this before they are issues is important to me so we can both agree on common ground and know what to expect. Thankyou again  to the helpful comments that helped me see that a flat 50/50 is not reasonable for a long term relationship."	1238	621

My mom and my stepdad are getting a divorce. This has been going on for two years, and it has not been pleasant. My mom asked if she could store her things from the marital home at my house. I agreed, and her things have been here for a year, I also swap her tires for her now, instead of my stepdad. 

Fast forward to a few months ago when my stepdad sells the marital home. He had two weeks to move all of his stuff, including their hot tub. My mother helped with nothing because "" I haven't lived there in two years, why would I help?"". My stepdad didn't have time to sell the hottub, so he asked if myself and my spouse wanted it. If not, he was going to throw it out, because he just doesn't care anymore. 

My spouse and I agree to have it moved to our house and ask how much. My stepdad replies ""ask your mother, as far as I'm concerned your family and you can have it for free."" A week goes by, the sale finalizes, my mom knows we have the tub, we have made small talk about it. I ask her how much she wants for it, which unleashes a shit storm of crazy. 

She tells me that she is going for the cost of the hottub through her lawyer, as her and my stepdad had agreed to put the tub in storage apparently and sell it from there. I tell her that we can sell it from my house and she doesnt have to do that or I can put it in storage so she can sell it, or she can just give me a price. She replies "" your stepfather is manipulating you into fighting with me, he's just trying to fuck me over. Just you wait until we go to court, I'm bringing Gerry and Steph and they are going to testify that he's been threatening me. You're going to get a free hottub and you should bring popcorn because the show will be so good, the judge is going to ruin him.""

I became upset, told her she was being unreasonable, and that I would talk to her later. We haven't spoken since, and that was a few months ago. Yesterday, she sent me a rather formal text message, asking when I would be home so she could get her winter tires. We picked a time, and this morning a courier showed up to get her tires. A fucking courier. She couldn't call me, or speak to me like her child, or even see me in person. She just treated the whole thing like a business transaction. 

So WIBTA for telling her to get someone to pick up the rest of her stuff? She can't call me, or see me in person, why should I be free storage? If she is going to treat me like a business I might as well behave like one. 

TLDR: my mother refuses to speak to me in person, only send formal text messages, and has sent a courier to pick up her tires from my house. I want to have her send a courier to get the rest of it out of my house."	55	14

She didn't have much of a friend group of her own since she just got back from studying abroad, so she joined in on mine pretty quickly. She was the type of person to want to be close with everyone and have as many friends as she could, she would ask my friends to hang out one on one without me pretty quickly into the friendship, which felt a little weird but honestly didn't really bother me much, as she would always tell me about it after and just seemed excited to be connecting with people again. I have a boyfriend who lives about an hour and a half away from me and due to different schedules we see each-other every or every other weekend, sometimes longer between. 

She asked me for his number so that she could text him to try to make coffee plans with him next time he was in town so she could get to know him more one on one. My issue was that since he lived far away this would take away from the time that i got to spend with him. I felt this was a little weird and so i explained to her that since i don't get to see him everyday (or even once a week most times) that i didn't feel like she needed to have his number or be hanging out with him one on one and that she could get lunch or something with us next weekend when he came to visit me. All was fine, she said she totally understood why i felt that way and we moved on.

Didn't think about this again until a month or so later- i was hanging out with my boyfriend and he casually said that my friend had texted him. I asked him how he had her number and he said that about a month ago she had DMed him on insta because she had a good idea for a birthday gift he could get me. Okay, totally fine. What i had an issue with is that she DMed him asking for his number so that she could text him the gift idea, and then proceeded to randomly text him here and there (nothing too often or suspicious) about other things as well.

So i texted her about it. I wasn't at all trying to start anything i just stated something along the lines of ""hey, I just found out that you asked my boyfriend for his number and am just a little hurt that you would go behind my back when i had explain earlier why i don't feel like you need it. I'm not mad and no hard feelings at all, just wanted to explain how it made me feel!'. She got super defensive and kept saying that i was being dramatic and that she did it for me because she wanted me to get a good birthday present, and that she was just trying to be a good friend. At that point it did escalate a bit and we argue texted back and forth, i didn't reply after a while and we never talked again after that. She was a pretty selfish friend (was always late or would cancel plans after they were suppose to start, or just forget about them) so i didn't make a point to reach out and mend things after that, which part of me feels like i should have.

Thoughts?? Am i the asshole?"	341	108

Last year A’s birthday was pretty bad. My friend(I’ll call B) and I could not get out of work but still headed over for dinner after we got out. As soon as we arrived A was in a bad mood and was very cold to us. She also had not decided where we should eat. This frustrated B and me as she was being very rude and difficult so we urged her to pick a restaurant as it was her birthday dinner.

For a majority of the night A did not want to join the conversation and was being very moody. I later found out she had posted a picture on her Snapchat story talking about how we were ignoring her(we weren’t) while we were sitting right across from her.

This passive aggressive action was something we had discussed with her in the past and urged her not to do instead of communicating with us. So needless to say, I was hurt. I told her to give me space until I was ready to speak with her again. About a week later she apologized and assured us she would try to work on these behaviors that had been brought up before and we all made up.

Onto this year. A has told us that she doesn’t want to do anything for her birthday this year because last year was so bad. I said that this year could be better because she could actually plan something out this time but she got upset and asked how last year was her fault. I reminded her of what happened and she shut down and began acting coldly again.

A few day’s ago she posted on Snapchat about wanting to take a trip on her birthday, but didn’t mention this to B or me. B asked her what was going on and they got into a fight. A basically began saying it was entirely B’s and my fault for her birthday being horrible last year and she began changing details of what actually happened and twisting things around. I don’t know if she thought we would forget or something but B and I remember everything that happened. She even brought up me not talking to her for a bit while leaving out the part where she was badmouthing us to friends online(she later claimed the snap was supposed to go to a guy but that’s honestly just as bad?) and hurt me.

So now I haven’t spoken to A since and she has accused us of lying and ruining her birthday last year. 

WIBTA if I did what she wanted and didn’t throw her any sort of birthday celebration even if I know it will upset her and she will likely talk about us on Snapchat?"	6	17

I'm a Senior and X is a Junior. The apartment is owned by my dad who tolerates recreational weed, but no hard drugs. We live in the U.S. in a state where recreational weed consumption is illegal. We are both expected to move out by mid-December.

Me and X have been excellent roommates who rarely argued in the first few years. We are both laid back and decently tidy. 

About 2 years ago, X began selling weed to help pay for his tuition. He began to sell more and more and he began to sell other drugs as well. He started selling Xanax, mushrooms, LSD, THC carts, cocaine, and more weed.

We both would smoke and go out together often and there were no problems. I always pay him on time for carts. We got along well.

I was incredibly anxious for a long time because of the traffic coming in and out of my apartment. I was worried that someone would notice the large amounts of people coming in and out of the same apartment and get suspicious. It might have been my anxiety talking, but I was horrified of the thought of police breaking into the apartment and seizing everything. I was told that my dad's apartment could be classified as a trap house and be seized too (I could be way off).

2 months ago, my dad paid for renovations to the apartment on the condition that I install everything myself. I coordinated with the floor people, electricians, plumbers, and repainted all of the walls in the apartment. I moved most of the furniture out of the apartment for the renovators while X was at work. I didn't mind doing the work since I didnt have to pay for anything. I was a little disappointed X didnt offer to help at all, but I didn't mind. I felt like we equally handled our roommate responsibilities.

Since X has been dealing at this scale, his cleaning and tidiness has deteriorated, but I dont really mind. I also feel like the risks I'm taking by allowing him to sell out of my dad's apartment is overlooked by X.

Around a month ago, I broke up with my longtime girlfriend and fell back into a depression. As a result, my tidiness deteriorated. I would get chores done, but it would take maybe a day or two.

Today, I venmo requested X for the internet bill. When X got home from work, he said, ""I'll pay the internet bill, but you need to do your dishes."" He pointed to the left side of the sink. I got up and said I've been cleaning his messes and doubling up on some chores around the house. X immediately responded that ""we only have 2 more months together, let's just clean up after ourselves."" I was upset and said, ""fine, if you want to start keeping score of who has done what chores then we can do that.""

Kinda funny, but me and X have been angrily cleaning the apartment while not speaking to each other. 

So, AITA for the way I handled this situation?

Everyone we spoke to seemed really into the idea except my dad. He had a small legal issue from the 1980s that could keep him out of the USA (depending on how nice the border guard is). He’s been in the states once or twice with no issue in the last 35 years but all before 9/11, which is when he decided never to go across the border again - assuming they wouldn’t let him. 

I looked into some options and found a waiver which he can apply for that will essentially pre-approve his crossing for a year. It costs about $650 USD, which we offered to pay for, but it takes a lot of paperwork and stuff to get which he has to do himself and it isn’t 100% guaranteed - but is very likely - to be approved. 

He has pushed back on this but seemed willing to try. The stress of it all caused us to start looking at some local venues and we began to consider staying here - even tho the cost is way higher and more stress for me and my fiancé. 

A couple weeks later I called him to ask about his guest list needs and he made a comment about the wedding license which is when I mentioned we may not sign one as we would be considered common law and a few other reasons that are personal to us. He then lost his mind and started saying we weren’t having a wedding - we were planning a party. That really hurt my feelings and I told him so but he kept insisting it wasn’t a real marriage or a real wedding etc. saying he’s “old fashioned” and it was only a marriage if we signed the marriage certificate. We finished that conversation when he said “I’ll still come to your party though if you have it in Canada” and I said I didn’t want him to come to my “Party” if he was going to disrespect it. Then I hung up and we haven’t talked in 2 weeks. He didn’t even call me on my birthday - just posted a Facebook message. 

My fiancé and I have since decided 100% to go forward with Vegas and just do what feels right to us. 

So, AITA if I continue planning my wedding in Vegas even if he may not come and because he doesn’t believe it’s “real”?

EDIT 1: People seem really concerned about the destination part of this. Travel within Canada is extremely expensive. Flights and hotel in Vegas is quite a bit less expensive than flights between our two Canadian cities. The food etc is where it gets pricey. 

Also, one of our reasons for Vegas was to help cull the guest list. He and I are both very social and a local wedding would be out of control guest and cost wise. 

But I thought my dad would at least try to be there. 

EDIT 2: Many destination weddings are not “legal”, they are for the ceremony and the act of declaring your love and commitment in front of your friends and family. Often you will witness the couple signing a commemorative document, they are not actually being legally married in front of you. I don’t think we’re duping anyone - we’re declaring our love and commitment in front of our friends and family - just not to the Canadian government, instead we are dealing with our own lawyer to ensure we are both protecting our assets. 

In B.C., legally being married automatically splits your assets 50/50 and you need to add a lawyer to adjust those numbers and a bunch of other complicated things that aren’t what we’re into. Common Law Marriage allows many of the same benefits we would get from a marriage license but with less of a headache. Also, we haven’t completely decided against the marriage license, we’re still researching - although it shouldn’t be anyone’s choice but our own."	7	58

This starts when we passed high school and entered college. She (20F) was in a relationship with a buddy.

Both of us aspired to be doctors so we had lot of classes in common. When the results of the exams came out, I had bagged a seat at the best medical college in my state but she hadn't fared so well and took up a course in dentistry in the same city.

One day she texted asking for help. She seemed down so we met up for coffee. Told me that they had broken up. She didn't know why she was dumped. Now she was all alone in the city.

Feeling sorry, I taught her the bus routes, the cheap restaurants, the affordable cafes that a poor student must know, how to manage her finances. I took her to the thrift stores to get her the books she needed.

Meanwhile, I realized I had the hots for her. Cute, same age, laughed at my jokes, would listen to what I had to say and of a similar level of education. I 'fessed to her. She told me she was glad I felt that way and she too had a liking for me but she needed time as she was not over her ex.

We still went for dates. She wanted to appear for the entrance exams again to aim for a medical seat and as such I helped her in her studies upto the point that I was preparing quizzes for her during the day and delivering two-hour-long live lectures over video calls in the middle of the night from a boys' dormitory.

Two months after I had confessed to Her, her roommates contacted me. They informed me that a final year dentistry student from Her college had been hitting on Her for the last few weeks and that day, they had gone on a date. 

I was jealous, but we were dating casually. What actually set off red flags was that she had strongly asserted many times about being monogamous.

I straight up asked her about it. She said it was actually her third date with him and they were both extremely eager to get together. She was GOING to tell me on our next date and hid it from me because it would surely ""hurt"" me. 

Realizing what a shit hand I was being dealt I ended everything right there. No wanting to meet up, ever. You can now prepare for your exams yourself or pay for an actual tutor. I'm done.

A year later, I am still keeping myself out of the dating scene, because in my mind I know that even if I manage to hit it off with someone, I know I'll still be having trust issues.

A year later she contacts me again. Despite the obvious cold shoulder from me she tells me that her boyfriend has not being paying her the attention I used. He's even more insecure and doesn't allow any male friends. When asked about how well her medical entrance exam went, she replied that she decided to forego it because her boyfriend was not ok with it and didn't want her to leave his side.

I blocked her then and there. Without any explanation.

Now she's telling all our mutual friends what a rude sonuvabitch I am. 

AITA in this? I realize I was too naive in the beginning but was my reaction too harsh?"	0	11

I live in southern Maine, all around a quiet, friendly area with not very much crime but there is a rising drug problem. I was driving my little brothers girlfriend home around 10pm. We drop her off, start heading home and all is well however we are both quite a bit hungry so I decided to stop at a convenience store on the way home which is where things started to get interesting. We went inside, he picked out what he wanted and went back out to the car while I paid. When I came out there was a woman sitting in the passenger seat of a white sedan talking to him. I approach the car and she goes ""excuse me...do you have a drivers license?""...to which I hesitantly replied ""yeah...why?"". She then proceeds to tell us that her friends and her had gotten into an argument and left her at the gas station, and she didn't have a drivers license so she couldn't take her car home. She then asked me to drive her car home and have my little brother follow. This screamed ""red flag say no"" to me, as I have never met this woman and was not about to get into her car with her, especially alone. I make an excuse, saying ""sorry but we need to get home to let our dog out"" and she goes ""I'm just around the corner it will only take 5 minutes"" to which I firmly said, ""I'm sorry but we cant help"" before getting into the car and driving off, while hearing her shout ""I don't know what else to do!!"". I feel like I did the right thing, for all I know she could have had a gun (very reasonable assumption in this area) and this was her plan to rob people. Also, she looked kind of rough and It didn't seem out of the range of possibility to me that she was using. With all this in mind I can't kick the feeling of guilt that I might have just left an innocent person in need of help stranded because of my paranoia.

I told them they weren't getting some important paperwork until they stopped acting like we were responsible for their fuck-ups. Boss is pissed because he thinks I'm being too aggressive, but imo I'm fighting the battle he's to scared to fight. AITA?

&amp;#x200B;

So part of my responsibilities here overlap with the project management aspect of what we do. Earlier this year we were awarded a large public project and from the get-go we knew there were going to be problems. Aside from the owner insisting on using cheap materials that we knew weren't going to hold up, the general contractor they hired was one of those big-name contractors that only cares about the bottom line. 

&amp;#x200B;

After months of one BS problem after the other, including my company having to pick up on another company's scope after they quit the job out of frustration, we FINALLY managed to conclude our part of the contract. This was mid-August of this year. It's now November and they're trying to assign blame for things that not only weren't our fault, but were veritably caused by their inability to follow through. We've caught them trying to exploit all kinds of loopholes and whenever we (I) called them out on it, we got to deal with emails and excuses as to why we were now obligated to provide all kinds of free services.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, after yet ANOTHER day wasted on emails with these guys, my boss basically told me to ""deal with it"" because at this point it had fallen pretty much on my plate and he wasn't informed enough to make a strong argument against what they were saying (I was). So I put on my big girl panties, pulled up all the metaphorical receipts, and sent another email making my case as to why we weren't responsible for fixing some other guy's fuck-up. Not surprisingly I got an equally long, condescending email from the contact there accusing us of shoddy craftsmanship and trying to get out of our responsibilities.

&amp;#x200B;

Now,we've built our company through reputation and we work our asses off to deliver, even when our customers are crappy. So I told him, essentially, that if they're going to give us shitty materials and demand we expedite our already short lead times because they're behind, then the least they could do is not act like complete assholes because they got what they paid for. And until they figured their shit out I was withholding paperwork that we needed to submit so they could get paid.

&amp;#x200B;

After all this I got chewed out by my boss for ""jeopardizing company relationships"". That upsets me because damn, shouldn't we have a little more pride than to let some entitled asshole walk all over us just because they think we won't say anything? I understand wanting to make nice with the customer, but if they're trying to screw us isn't it prudent to stand our ground instead of rolling over? He says I'm too aggressive, but I think I wasn't aggressive enough.

She always asks me to hang out and since we also go to school together I can’t say no all the time.
Last week I was at her house and she tells me she has BPD, I knew she had a mental illness of some kind cause she has always acted strange, goes to a therapist and also takes some kind of drugs but I didn’t know precisely.

The thing is, she is really really weird and no one wants to be her friend, she gets way too attached and people get scared. And she’s absolutely heartbroken every time someone goes away.

She says that she’s the problem and I always tell her that no, she isn’t the problem and other people are but in reality she IS the problem, obviously it’s not her, it’s the BPD but people don’t know that and don’t want to be around her, I always tell her that she’s an amazing, interesting person and that eventually she will find the right people, but I don’t really believe that and don’t know if lying is the right thing to do.

I don’t want her to feel bad, but I also feel like an hypocrite by saying all these nice things when I don’t really mean them.

While I understand why my Dad did what he did, he's gotta understand the stress this put on me too.   

Now for the actual point. I love my girlfriend, she's getting me through hard times, her family are like the family I never had. I tried to cut my Dad a deal, my girlfriends family only goes and does Christmas on Christmas day, so it's the only day I can go up there.  

My family does the Christmas stuff from Christmas eve to boxing day. I asked him if I could spend Christmas with my girlfriend and spend the rest of the holidays with them, he said that it could be his mothers last Christmas so I should be there. She's lived in France my whole life and I barely know her, only moving here this year.  

Am I the asshole here? My parents have never abused me, but their constant drug abuse and alcoholism has deteriorated my mental health in ways it's going to take a while to repair. I just wanted to be away from that this year."	6	15

I've been with my boyfriend for about 5 years. We don't live together yet (working on that).

What we've always done for the holidays is a little stressful for me because his parents are split up, so we effectively try to cram 3 ""parties"" across two days. We always go to his dad's on the 24th from like 8AM - 3PM, and then my family from 6PM - 10PM ish, then the following day, we'd go to his mom's from 9AM - 4PM.

Ever since we started dating, I would have a breakdown/panic attack on or around Dec 25th. We've been trying to figure out where it's coming from and I mentioned that the way his family does Christmas is very foreign and ""cold"" to me, so we tried some things around it. For example, we tried changing start times and dates so I more of a ""recharge"", but I still have the panic episodes because it's still a chore.

I feel like an asshole, but I just don't like hanging out at his mom's apartment, especially for the whole day. I like his mom in principle and we talk online sometimes, but I guess as the kids say, I don't like the readings I get when I ""vibe check"" her. I know this is super classist, but she was an addict, has had a recent relapse, lives in section 8 housing, doesn't work, and is diagnosed bipolar.

One time, I meant to make a cute comment about one of my boyfriend's baby pictures because he was a bit of a tubby baby. She blew up at me and made a huge deal about it. I was speechless. When my bf went to the bathroom, she continued to yell at me while I was just frozen silent. Christmas should be a time of warmth and feeling loved, not walking on eggshells. I've tried to get out of seeing his mom before, but he will then bring up that she ""bought me gifts!!"" in order to guilt me into coming (sadly, it works).

The issue is that this year I've made it my goal to stand up for what I want more, and not being afraid of peoples' judgment for saying ""no"". I've told my bf that I will not be spending Christmas Day at his mom's, and he says he will talk to her about moving it to another day. I said that I'd really just prefer him to spend Christmas Day with his own mom instead of calling a rain check for me.

My parents are older too, so they don't have a lot of time left. I think Christmas should be a time spent with those you love the most, and for my, that is decidedly my parents/family. We will have many Christmases where it's just the two of us later in life.

**tl;dr - My ""MIL"" gives me the heebe jeebes because she's unstable and I hate spending Christmas with her. I'd rather spend it with my own (older) parents, even if my bf isn't present, but my bf keeps insisting that couples need to be glued at the hip during the holidays. AITA for drawing a boundary that's unusual?**"	2	17

So, unfortunately I have to sell my bearded dragons. I was messaged by a lady who was interested in buying them (2) as a christmas present for her daughter. Her daughter came to my house to look at them, I explained everything and told her how much I was asking. Later that day I received a call from her mom telling me that they are gonna buy them, and how excited they were. 

Fast forward to today her mom messages me asking if the table the tank was standing on was included in the offer to which i replied No it isn’t but for 10 more bucks you can have it. She messaged back telling me that she cant afford it because she only has $80. Mind you the asking price was $100 and I never agreed to anything lower. She continued saying how she had to save money for months to be able to spend $80.

Because she said that, I don’t want to sell them to her anymore. I want the lizards to have a nice home where they have everything they need and not get abandoned because they cost money to keep alive. I don’t think they considered food, supplements, electricity etc. Her daughter was really looking forward to them but I just can’t do it. I understand money can be an issue but if you barely get by you shouldn’t buy a pet imo. 

Am I in the right here? Sorry for the long text.

Update: I explained to her how if she can’t even come up with the full asking price, she won’t be able to care for them in the long run.  She agreed. They’re gonna look for a different pet, one they can afford. Thank you all for the input."	2551	193

He apologized but did not seem to care much when I was upset about it.

My coworker Evan and I have become pretty good friends since I started working there. We’re both guys in our twenties. 

This last weekend I was just hanging out at home with my girlfriend watching movies. It was Saturday night around 2am when I get a call from Evan. Thinking that something happened, I pick up. 

He’s sobbing on the phone and it takes me a couple minutes to calm him down. Eventually he blurts out that he’s in love with me and wishes that I would feel the same about him.

I just went quiet and said that it’s probably best if he just goes to bed and I hung up. 

The next day (Sunday) he sent me a big long text message apologizing and saying how embarrassed he was. I never answered. 

On Monday I went to HR and told them (and showed the texts) what happened and that I just wanted it on the record so that it couldn’t come back to haunt me somehow.

I’ve been avoiding him as much as possible and today he tried to talk to me on my way to the washroom and I just told him that I don’t think we should talk anymore and if he kept trying to talk to me I would put in a formal complaint. 

I didn’t even know he was gay but I also don’t know if I did the right thing. I went into work super angry on Monday and I don’t know if I overreacted or not. At the same time, I don’t want to be accused of homophobia or some other bullshit and having this come back at me.

He'll finish his cup and drink from mine. He's done that since we were dating. It drives me nuts, but 'pick your battles' right? Anyways. That it's what I yelled at him for, but it's important information.

Twice, in two months he has gotten sick and then given it to me. I'm stay at home right now with my son so it is really unlikely that I got sick first. He doesn't cover his mouth when he coughs, he'll still drink out of my cup, etc. He didn't even tell me he wasn't feeling well because he was wanting to get some action. Now, we are both sick *again,* and our 5.5 month old son also has a fever.

So, today while I was cooking dinner, while feeling like utter crap, he comes over and picks up my water bottle, drinks, coughs on the dinner I was making, and then goes to leave.

I ...kinda lost it on him. I yelled at him for being inconsiderate. I blamed him for getting us sick, told him he needed to restrain himself when he is sick so he doesn't spread it, and told him to stop drinking my GD water.

Now he's acting like it is the end of the world while taking a bath.

I feel justified, but also guilty. I don't know guys, am I the asshole?

Edit: I told him the first two dozen or so times that it bugs me when would drink from my water, but he kept doing it. I love most everything else about the man, but growing up with nurses for parent, sharing water is so *gross.* He started doing it after a few months of us dating.

Their dogs bark 14 hours a day, and they are not small/quiet dogs. It sounds like they are barking directly at my front door, and it's agitating my dogs and making them bark.

That's where the AITA part comes in. I have dogs too, which have been a problem in the past (6 months to 10 months ago), but I've rearranged my work schedule so either my wife or I are home 24/7, except for up to 10 hours on the weekend where we visit family and have to leave them home. 

Before these people moved in, my dogs were quiet 90% of the time we were gone. Now, whenever neighbors dogs bark my dogs get upset and bark. So whenever we're not home, it must sound like a free-for-all. 

We know this because we have a camera system in place (specifically for the dogs).

So, WIBTA for complaining about their dogs to my apartment complex? 

As far as I know, the apartment will give them a warning and put them ""on probation"" for a noise complaint, which is what happened to us 6 months ago."	4	6

Married for 12 years, but have a long, weird history prior to marriage. When we first got married we were barely getting by but over the years, became pretty comfortable. About 3 years into marriage, my husband got laid off and delivered pizzas for two years while going to school to get an associate’s. He’s now working in his field. 

Up until 3 years ago I was working in a professional role making 6 figures and was the primary income, with about 2x my husband’s salary.  But I was burned out and hated my job. There’s way more to this part, but it’s not really relevant to the question and I’m trying to keep it as brief as possible. Anyway, we discussed it, rearranged our finances, downsized our home and I left my job. Over the past couple or years I’ve been consulting/freelancing and taking over nearly 100% of taking care of the home while he worked full time. Since then, he’s made significant headway with his salary and with my income and the cuts we have made to our budget, we’re in good shape (although not like we were). 

**Current situation:**

I decided to go back to school for an MSW and am working part time at Starbucks. I’ve sundowned my consulting business and gave up an adjunct job (didn’t pay much). What I make working 20-30 hours a week at Starbucks only a little less than what I was making freelancing but it’s steady and dependable income, unlike freelance work. And frankly, I love it. Its fun, stress free, and allows me to interact with a lot of people. It’s also great with school because it’s flexible and I can make it all work and still maintain the house and all the other stuff. 

My husband is really stressed about his job. This is sort of his status quo, though. He likes it whatever he’s doing for a while and then becomes overworked and frustrated that no one else works as hard. He gets overwhelmed, depressed, and disgruntled. He’s said he wants “his turn” and would like to just go work in a bookstore or something but feels obligated to maintain his job for benefits. 

I’m all for him having “his turn” and have told him as much. But I would like to finish my degree and get back into full time work first. We have 20 years before we’re ready to retire so it’s important to me to work in a field that I’m passionate about rather than one that just pays well but sucks the life force out of me. 

He hasn’t said anything directly, but I worry he may resent me being so happy with what I’m doing while he’s feeling forced to keep working a job he’s not happy with. AITA here?"	23	18

She holds this party every year. In year’s past, she’s had full meals out to eat. This year, she said she was just doing appetizers and desserts. I understood because her life has gotten hectic. And as host, she can choose what to provide.

However, the party was held during a meal time. The appetizers were a few anti pasta dishes and the desserts were some cookies. My family was still hungry and I heard other people complaining they were too. No one could leave early however, because we always do a Yankee/white elephant swap and some other activities. So, I ordered some cheese pizzas and had them delivered. It was enough to feed the party and they were happy.

My cousin got upset because it “upstaged” her. She said everyone was aware what she was providing and could eat before/after. To me, it was just making sure people had enough to eat. She said that wasn’t my responsibility. Her husband and surprisingly, my wife backed her up.

My aunt's husband died over 15 years ago. Some time after that she sorted through his things and gave some away. Among these things was his stamp collection - several full big albums.

At that time I was an avid collector of stuff: postcards, coins and notes, calendars, etc. She gave the albums to me saying that she didn't need them, and I had expressed interest in the collection before. Her daughter kept one album with animal stamps. I didn't mind (it was a gift after all), although I would've gladly exchanged the album with Soviet propaganda stamps for the animals.

Anyway, I really liked this collection. I reorganized it, added to it a little, and kept showing it to those who wanted to see it and those who didn't, but were kind enough not to tell me to ef off.

Fast-forward about 15 years.

I receive a message from my aunt asking when she can come and pick up the albums. Not asking me if I was willing to give them up. There wasn't even any sort of polite preface - just ""what's your address and when can I come to pick them up"". I was annoyed by her attitude and told her ""no"".

She then proceeded to explain how she needed them for her grandson (about 6 at that time), how it is a hobby more suitable for a boy (I am female and now an adult), how it would remind her grandson of his granddad (whom he had never met)...

When I said that it was given to me as a present and wasn't it rude to ask me to give it back, she said that it was never meant to be a present. I was just given the albums to keep, as she was renovating her apartment (for over 15 years?) and had no place to store them (has an apartment and a country house).

I kept refusing and was called ungrateful, a bad niece, and how she's done so much for me (not really...) and I'm refusing to do this for her and her grandson (we hardly ever keep in touch). She said that she remembers each stamp her husband bought (which I doubt as there are probably a couple thousand) fondly and would like to see them again, yada yada.

I'm not very confrontational and not very good at saying no firmly. I was 100% sure I wouldn't give the albums back, but I could not say it as firmly. First, I said that there's a mess in my apartment since I've moved (which was true) and it'll take me a while to sort through the boxes - she offered to come and do it for me.

Eventually, I told her that I couldn't find the albums and that they were likely lost when I was moving to the new place (not true). I doubt she believed me but she probably finally understood that I wouldn't be giving the albums back.

Since then, we haven't had any contact for 3-4 years, but I still keep going back to me and wondering if I should have behaved differently.

The collection isn't worth much as most of the stamps aren't rare or not in a very good condition. But it is something that I've loved and considered my property for half of my life.

About two months ago I told a classmate of mine that I liked her over voice message, as I never found a fitting opportunity to do it in person, and she's one of those girls always with her best friend, so no time to speak with her alone.

She didn't reciprocate the feelings, but she didn't outright reject me either. I assumed that was because, even if she had no feelings for me at the moment, she wanted to keep the option open for herself. We started chatting over the fall break, and she messaged me every day for two weeks straight, including texting me at 5am, and like, sending me funny videos over instagram and such. After school began again however, I really felt that she wasn't comfortable whenever I talked to her, and that feeling only grew. Eventually I decided to talk to her about it, and in the conversation she said she only wanted to be friends. That stung a little, but I was happy to finally have certainty on the kind of relationship she wanted to have with me. I told her as much, and that I would be happy to be friends, as I genuinly liked spending time with her.

Things did not get better however, and she still seemed very uncomfortable whenever I was around. After a few weeks of this I decided to talk to her one last time about it, and in that conversation she said she didn't want to be friends and just have a ""good relation in class"", and that I should stop texting her as well, because she never meant for that to be a sign of friendship, and she didn't want to give me false hope.

At that point I decided to stop talking to her, because I felt that I had tried enough and that she clearly didn't want to have anything to do with me. That weekend she wrote me that she felt weird if I ignored her like that. She also said she didn't feel comfortable hanging around with our mutual friends group anymore either.

So one last time I decided to talk to her. She basically just reiterated she wanted to have ""good class relation"" and nothing more. I had enough at that point, and made the decision to longer be in contact with her. I blocked her on her different accounts, so that I wouldn't have the option of messaging her, and I also kicked her from our group chat, because what's the point of her being in it if she didn't want to spend time with anyone, because of me?

The next day I got a message from a person I was not aware existed: Her boyfriend, who told me to leave her alone, and not in a nice way. I showed her the messages and she got mad at me for apparently implying that she had something to do with it.

I haven't spoken to her since and tried avoiding her as much as possible. I don't feel good about it, because I can constantly tell how annoyed she and her best friend are at me, but also I don't exactly want to try and fix the situation, because I tried fixing things enough times IMO.

He didn’t have a job, but promised to get one ASAP and start paying me back for his room (and all its furniture and electronics), which I had taken a loan out for. He was my best friend, and I trusted him. However, after 4 months and no job, the loan money was gone.

RM promised he’d help me find a month-to-month tenant (MTM) if he couldn’t find a job by mid-Nov. RN was basically living at his boyfriend’s (BF) 2 hours away by then, even though he insisted we were still roommates. But that time came, I could not make rent, and when I tried to talk to him about it, he disappeared. When I finally got in contact with him a week later, he was mad. He had been depressed and didn’t want to talk to anyone. By repeatedly reaching out, I was disrespecting his boundaries. He reluctantly helped me write a short craigslist ad. It went nowhere, so I had to borrow money from a friend to make Dec’s rent and posted his room on Airbnb. Thankfully, I live in NYC and was able to get enough guests to pay Jan’s rent.

Airbnb‘s like a second job and I hate it. RM said I should try looking for a MTM again, who we’d get rid of once he had a job. I posted more ads, but everyone I heard from wanted a long term rental.

Then BF’s father died. While BF was out of town, RM and I talked (via Skype, as he hadn’t been in our apartment for a month) about our living situation. I asked if I should be looking for a new RM, but he told me to keep looking for a MTM, and he’d make it work until he could move back in. The shortest renter I could find wanted the room till May. RM was planning on moving in with BF in Aug, meaning he’d only move back in for 3 months, so I asked him his thoughts.

RM was with his BF’s family and refused to discuss this with me. I admit, I got mad. Not the best timing, I know, but I‘d been struggling by myself to make ends meet in a situation of his creation for months. I was frustrated and told him as much. He said I was being disrespectful, emotionally manipulative, and seeking attention; I needed to make this decision myself, without his input. So I did: RM needed to move out by the end of the month, so I could get someone who could pay rent. He declared our friendship over.

RM and BF came to get his stuff 2 days after the funeral. After they left, I got a barrage of texts reading me to filth for making them leave BF’s grieving mother to get RM’s stuff. I knew RM’d be reliant on BF to come up (he doesn’t have a driver’s license) but I thought they’d do so next weekend or ask me to hold it for longer.

While I think I was right in my decision to kick RM out, I feel awful that BF had to get involved while he was dealing with his father’s death.

So tell me, reddit: AITA for giving my roommate a deadline to move his stuff out, knowing that his boyfriend‘s father just died?"	14	38

I’ve had two friend groups for the longest time. Whenever I hang with one of them, they’re always good about making plans ahead of time. Stuff like “wanna grab lunch Thursday” or “how about a game night this weekend?” I’m not talking weeks in advance, just a few days if not a day ahead of time. 

Other group rarely does this and is always just calling me asking if I can do something right then and there and I often feel like they are frustrated when I can’t. Oftentimes, it’s not even that I can’t, it’s just that I’ve sat down to do something personal that I want to do cause I thought I was free that day, then I get a call or text wanting to make spontaneous plans and I get frustrated. 

Here’s where the WIBTA comes in. If I were to make a suggestion to these friends that they try to plan things ahead of time with me, WIBTA? The reason I ask if because I’ve been in the opposite position with other friends before and felt that this suggestion comes off as somewhat arrogant to say “if you want to hang with me, I need to know in advance”. I just find myself frustrated though that all the time I never really know if I’m free because if I’m doing something that day, I’m not asked till right then and there.

That sounds bad, but hear me out 
A bit of background. Last May I (26F) moved back home (I was living in England. We are now in Spain) while 6 months pregnant. So now my fiancé, 4mo baby and yours truly live with my parents (60s) and brother (21M) 
My fiancé is working and we're saving the money to moved to our own place.

The AITA question: my dad's bday is in new year's eve. He's turning 61.
I agreed with him and my mum that I was gonna bake cake and cupcakes for him as a present (not that is something expensive, but takes lot of time and having a baby, time is golden.

My sister (33) want us (our 2 brothers 21&amp;36) and myself to gather money to get our dad a present, 20€ each.
I said no, as can't and basically don't want to.

So AITA for refusing to give her money? 

TL;DR my sister want us (4 siblings) to gather money for my dad's bday present. I can't and don't want to.

EDIT: some info.
We does live in the house rent free, but we contribute in other ways (mostly food and helping around) 
I said ""I don't want to"" not because of my dad, but because of my sister. She's being too pushy about it. 
My dad is way Happy I'm making his favourite cake as I wasn't here last year for his bday.
Here where we live, a pack of 60 nappies cost around 23€ (sometimes less with coupons and/or offers) and last me around 10 days. 
Also, my baby's been in hospital the past 2 weeks. So taking the bus to get there, buying coffee and things to eat while there (yes,I took my flask with hot drink and food most times, but didn't have a place to warm things up. So mornings and lunch time used to buy food there) 
This month's been financially horrible for us. That's why I'm offering to bake"	8	17

For the past two months my husband was hinting on giving me a trip as a christmas present. By hinting I meant he asked me about destinations, wanted to know when can I take leave off work, and one time he even said that he’d “take back the tickets” when we argued.


Long story short, I was super excited. I told about it to all my friends and coworkers, and my friends were acting as if they were on it, hinting that I will be super pleased with my gift and all.


Christmas came and I was opening my presents super excited because the ticket HAD to be in one, right? Well, there wasn’t. I asked my daughter if she knows anything about it and if maybe my husband forgot to put it under the tree and all. She said he didn’t talk with her. I quietly asked him where’s the ticket and he started laughing and said “what ticket?”. 


I thought he was playing with me and I said that I’m sure he has it somewhere and he’s just pulling my leg. Well, he got more serious and said that no, there’s not a ticket. That’s where I started crying. I know I should have kept it quiet, but I was sure he was giving me that trip and it turned out he wasn’t. 


He started saying how he wanted to buy it, but then our common friends didn’t have free time to go with us so he gave up. This made me cry even more and I gotta admit I started telling him how I don’t care for friends and why is their opinion more important than mine and how I always dreamt of getting a trip as a gift (I organize all of the trips usually). 


After that I went to the toilet and stayed there crying for 15 more minutes and then I came back to the table and tried to pretend everything was cool, but it was clear that everyone was uncomfortable. In that time, my husband was on his phone, actually buying me a  trip right then and there because I was so upset before. Clearly, that made me super happy, so I started apologizing to everyone and hugging him and all. Thought all was well.


Well, my daughters said I’m a huge asshole for “making a scene” and that I’m not a little kid to be crying over gifts. They also said that I’m an asshole for making “dad feel bad” because he clearly spent a lot of money and bought me a lot of gifts and I whined about the trip anyway.


I understand that it was bad of me to break down in front of entire family over that trip, but I can’t really control myself when something is so upsetting. I went to the toilet, so they don’t see me crying and all.


AITA here?


Edit: this is getting brought up in the comments a lot, so I’ll clarify. I wasn’t upset because his gifts were less expensive than a trip. I was upset because I always plan everything for us and getting a trip would mean that the finally decided to unburden me and plan something by himself. I understand that my reaction was still assholish though.


Edit 2: this is being brought up in a lot of comments too. I’m definitely an emotional person, but my husband wasn’t “implying”, I “might” get a trip. 


He had money set aside for this purpose (I paid for and organized the last one) and he explicitly asked me about all the details (when I can take time off work, where do I want to go specifically, who should we take etc), so he can get it for me as a “christmas gift”. 


We had countless conversations about how much I wanted him to just plan things and he said he would. He talked to all of our friends (I knew of more details through them), he mentioned the trip to my younger daughter (asking her if she wants to go too), and literally said in an argument that he bought the tickets, but he will now take them back (this is recorded, I didn’t just misheard him). 


I know that I still shouldn’t have been sure that he’d get it, but it wasn’t just implied, he was periodically mentioning it to me and asking me about details."	2683	963

We were at our parent's place for christmas and it was only us in the house.

I had the image of the girl I would talk about boys with and fought with but I have no idea who she really is now. We talked during the holidays but it was kinda awkward and we just didn't interact

When I got home I got a call from my mom saying that she wishes for me and my sister to be closer. I apologized and said ill try harder but the truth is I don't think I want a close relationship with my sister......I don't really know what to do

I said I would not call them that as i found it insensitive (I have previously had a native American partner and am sensitive towards issues surrounding the nations) I explained my reasons. My friend instantly jumped down my throat calling me rude and disrespectful. I did not respond, but simply muted the conversation because I was at work. I proceeded to go about my work day and left the conversation on mute. Two days later I realized that it was still on mute and checked it. My friend had blown up my phone calling me a bad friend and that there was a nickname option (that I found perfectly fine and would have called then with zero issues) she called me transphobic and informed me that they had both decided to not attend my engagement part eventhough my friend was a bridesmaid! I informed her of my mistake and apologized for waiting so long to respond said I would without hesitation call their partner by their chosen nickname, but if they felt that strongly about my beliefs that the name was disrespectful then the choice to not attend was theirs to make. She then said that I was toxic and she didnt need me in her life and that she wished me the best. I'm honestly still extremely hurt and i miss my friend every day.

It has about 15 parking spaces, three of which are accessibility spaces reserved for people with a parking pass. 

I suffered an injury a while back that makes mobility very difficult, and have a temporary disability parking pass for this time while I’m healing.  As far as I know, I’m the only regular patron here with such a pass.  All three spots are regularly occupied by vehicles that don’t display a pass. 

I spoke to the manager, and a notice was issued recently asking people to at least leave the closest spot open.  Today when I arrived, once again, all three spots were occupied, and not a pass in sight.

I complained to management again, they’re going to issue another notice, which I appreciate.  But I was so pissed off, that I decided to also call the municipality to report the problem and ask them to at least investigate.  While this is private property, the municipality may still have the authority to intervene and issue tickets as it relates to handicap spaces.  It’s entirely possible they will do so later today before any parents have seen the second notice from management. 

This abuse of accessible spaces has been happening for more than a year and has always annoyed me, but it wasn’t until I personally needed the spaces that I decided to do something about it.

AITA for involving the authorities before parents can see the second notice?  AITA for not alerting the management, so they can alert parents of the potential for enforcement?  I suspect the scofflaws have been lulled into a false sense of security because until now, no one has asked them not to do this, and the fine here is pretty hefty.  On the other hand, I feel like it shouldn’t matter and if you don’t have a pass, you shouldn’t be parking in such a spot."	9	35

Girl has her baby in the hospital and he invites me over because the house is quiet, shows me around the house: a nursery for the baby, kids room, his room....where’s her room? Oh and they share the main suite bathroom and all her shit is on the vanity?

Soon after she comes home from the hospital, he doesn’t message/ contact at all for 2 days which is really weird, said he was spending time with the oldest child and the kid is asking him why he can’t be dad like old times, and that he’s really confused.

We were supposed to meet this week for lunch, and I had to push the time about an hour. I let him know this weeks in advance, and it was all set. 

The morning of, he texts me and tells me he's decided to go to work that day (he has a set schedule and we planned on a day he always has off). I got upset and told him that I hope it was all worth it. He said lunch with me doesn't pay his bills, work does. That's always his excuse. Always. I work too and I have bills. I work 60+ hours a week to pay all my bills, but I still took the time to spend time with my father. 

I told him I'm really tired of him cancelling on me and if he doesn't want to see me he should say so. I said he hasn't been there for me in 2 years and I've tried very hard to involve him in the important things in my life, and it seems like he couldn't care less. 

He said I expect everyone to roll over for me and do exactly what I want and that I put myself in a bad situation so it's not his fault.

I told him that I havent asked him for anything in 2 years since he wouldn't call me back after finding a dead body and I dont expect anything from him. He's offered things, then backed out and given me the same bullshit excuse, and he should stop acting like he's a saving grace father of the year. 

After that, he stopped fighting with me and agreed to reschedule and keep his day clear so he wouldn't cancel. I truthfully dont believe him but i also agreed to reschedule.

It was sent to both our emails and had the correct wedding date for us, but it was addressed to names that are not ours. I figured it was a typo and said I would email the woman back to double check, but my fiance wanted to call her to ask. I said that I understood his concern and want to solve the issue but I felt like it was a dick move to call so close to midnight. He said it was totally justified since she emailed us at that time. We went back and forth for a while, him saying the time didn't matter since she emailed us, me saying we should still be courteous since she probably sent the emails quickly and assuming she wouldn't get responses til the next morning. While we were arguing, I emailed the woman and got the whole issue sorted out but we haven't spoken since then. I don't want to bring the issue up because I feel like I didn't do anything wrong but I can tell he's still mad. AITA?

Hopefully this makes sense and is okay, if not, sorry y'all."	6	11

A while ago, I was hanging out with Kevin’s wife of 3 years (“Eliza”) and Anna at Anna’s house for lunch. One thing that is important to note is that while Eliza is always sweet to me, Anna has always made passive aggressive comments towards me/my relationship with Jack. Case in point, when he first introduced us, her first comment was that “we probably wouldn’t last” and I was “a fling”, but I’m (slowly) trying to move past that. Back to Anna’s house, where I was attempting to bond. Anna suggested that Eliza and I help her pick out an outfit from her closet for a party she was going to. While we were doing so, Anna pulled out a rather ugly, unflattering dress and made a face at it, saying that she “only wore this one for things she didn’t care about”. Fast forward a couple of months to my bridal shower, and Anna shows up wearing the exact same dress!!! I was absolutely livid. After my friends/family left, I became ballistic and yelled at her for never taking me seriously/making me a joke when I’m actually becoming a member of her family. She was speechless and ran out. When I told my fiancé, he told me bringing up something like that was so petty of me to do. Eliza also agrees, and I’m feeling like I overreacted. AITA?? Just fed up with Anna.	29	21

I had a bold shade of orange in mind for the bridesmaid dresses and the groomsmen’s ties, which I think would look really festive and lively.

I sent a photo of a dress in the color I was looking for to the girls in our group chat and gave them free range to pick any style of dress they wanted, as long as the color was consistent. They sounded really excited and agreed.

Well, my maid of honor just sent me a screenshot of a conversation that took place in a separate group chat they have for planning the bachelorette party. Two of the girls were complaining about the dress color and saying they thought they were going to look really bad, and one of them said verbatim that she was dreading looking like a “f-ing traffic cone.” 

I feel really hurt that they chose to talk about me behind my back instead of approaching me with their concerns. Is orange really that bad a color? AITA?"	701	502

Me and a couple buddies were playing MP6 tonight, as buddies do, and on this particular map to get stars you have to purchase windmills that contain various amounts of said stars. One windmill in the center of the map has 3 stars you can buy.

I hit a bowser space, which gave a multiplayer minigame, where any players who lose would lose all their coins. My friend was 3 spaces away from the 3 star windmill. I intentionally fucked with him and we both lost all our money. He yelled at me and told me to ""focus on myself and my game"" to which I responded ""your 3 spaces away from a 3 star windmill, why the fuck wouldn't I try to make you lose all your money?""

He was pouting the rest of the game. Sure it was greasy as fuck but the point is to get stars and have other people not get stars, so he should quit being a bitch.

I will try to be brief as possible with background info, sorry. And I’m trying to be as diplomatic as possible with the wording so I’m not “playing the victim.”

My ex wants to claim my son on his taxes this year because he needs the money. 

Was with my ex boyfriend for 10 years, we have a 3 year old and I am due with number two in 4 weeks. I was about 5-6 months pregnant when we separated for various reasons.

We both worked last year, I made about twice his income. We both had car notes and insurance, and phones that we payed ourselves. He paid Daycare. I paid rent, utilities, groceries, and toiletries for the three of us. 

I had to quit my job when I moved with my son to stay with family until I get back on my feet. 
I plan on trying to go back to school next year, and I won’t be making anywhere close to the income I was making prior any time soon. 

I’m not going to compare what I’ve been doing to what he’s been doing in the last couple months. Let’s just say that we are both unemployed for reasons, 

I used my last paycheck from my job to catch up my car note/insurance etc. until the month after the baby is born. He gets a monthly stipend from unemployment. He no longer contributes to the kids and left with with about $1000 in debt from the apt we left.

So, I was planning on using my tax returns(should I actually get anything back) to not only survive with my two small children until I can get back into a job, but also to buy what I need for the baby- because I have nothing except my sons old crib right now. 

I have not gotten all my tax documents so I’m not sure what, if anything I’ll get back this year. 
But I don’t want to end up owing either. He has already determined what he would be getting back with and without my son and it’s a substantial difference. He said that he will give me half but he wants to do it now, which would also take a couple hundred dollar chunk out of the refund amount. I told him no. I said his financial contribution to his children was not enough to warrant half of anything and I will be claiming my son myself. 

He’s saying that if I don’t do this, he’s screwed. I told him that while I’m sympathetic to his situation, my kids come first. My answer is no. AITA?"	8	16

She’s 33, I’m 20 and we live 30 minutes away. I work Monday to Friday, 9-5 and honestly my free time is important to me. I feel badly my sister never learned to cook when she still lived with my parents, but I do not want to be responsible for teaching her. I have my own cooking for starters to do among other things. I gave her a recipe book last year filled with tons of family favourite recipes and she has a couple easier cookbooks too. 

I don’t feel like I have time to devote to this since my weekends are so filled doing my own cooking and catching up on errands. 

Additionally I am a vegan and my sister eats meat for all her dinners. I don’t feel comfortable teaching her how to cook with meat even though I know how to cook it (I learned to cook at 15, so I learned to cook meat because I didn’t go vegan until 19). 

She’s very disappointed I won’t help her and has told our mom she feels like I don’t care about her. AITA?

EDIT I thought I’d mention she asked me instead of our mom because she feels like I’m less likely to be annoyed at her lack of kitchen skills and get mad."	78	38

Well, me and 5 friends agreed on a vacation location and were starting to look in to booking it, the vacation was supposed to take place in several months.

Well we had been talking about it amongst our group a lot and this led to the cousin of one of Kate overhearing and showing a lot of interest.

Well I got informed my friend Kate invited her cousin to come along on our vacation.

Now this was supposed to be a friend vacation, no SO's, family etc, just the 6 of us having fun like we used to do(We are all mid 20's, me and Jess are 24, Kate, Jasmine and Aurora are 25 and Jane is 26.) So I was already unhappy about it. Kate's cousin is 21, extremely childish, entitled and pretty much a person you want to avoid, not someone you want to share a vacation house with for 3 weeks, added to that she is lazy and needs to be included in everything, so there is no avoiding her either, she has a tendency to invite herself via Kate.

Now after a day or two of thinking I decided I was not going to waste money on this and uninvited myself without giving a reason other then changing my mind. This had the effect of Jess, Jasmine and Jane also uninviting themselves pretty much using me not going as an excuse, today they came by asking why I uninvited myself and I told them the truth and they said they also didn't want to go but felt bad canceling without a reason, as a result we are now arranging a new vacation with the 4 of us and Aurora seems to want to cancel as well but she is shy so likely wont or will after a while.

Meanwhile Kate has sent me a bunch of angry messages, stating I pretty much dumped her with her cousin and caused everyone to bail so I feel pretty guilty as it was not my intention to get everyone to bail I simply did not want to go on a vacation with her cousin as such excluded myself, I had no idea it would have a domino effect.

So am I the asshole here?"	27	33

(27, even though he’s older I’m the one in charge) For Valentine’s Day my parents are going on an all adult cruise, leaving my brother and i home alone.  We have a wild cat that hangs outside our house, we give it food every night and essentially is our cat at this point. We call her kitty. It sleeps outside in the garage with a space heater and a good amount of food. We would let it inside but i’m allergic to cats. My eyes get super itchy and i become really uncomfortable. We have another indoor cat, Annie, but we have a gate up so she can’t get upstairs where i sleep. If she ever gets upstairs i have a really uncomfortable reaction and my eyes will be puffy for days. (This only happens when the gate is knocked over) However, Kitty is very athletic and can easily get passed the gate because she can just jump over it. The cat has always been outside and likes to hunt, so we kept it that way. Now that my parents are out of town my brother brings kitty in. Kitty then goes up to my room and lays down on my bed, getting fur all over it. She then starts pawing the sheets with her claws and rips them. I ask my brother to please stop bringing her inside because I’m allergic and in response to this I’m called bitchy. I love the cat a ton, I’m actually the one that convinced my dad to feed it, but since i still have to go to school every day he lets the cat roam around the house. Kitty goes upstairs and my room to hide under my beds. I continue to have an allergic reaction and i cant get rid of the cat.

TLDR: my brother keeps bringing in the outdoor cat even though im allergic.(the cat is more then capable of being outside and sleeping in the garage) He refuses to keep her out and I can’t enforce it because i have to go to school everyday."	0	23

He’s staying at my parents house. 

My husband and I picked him up from the airport last weekend at about 9 pm. I was sick and my husband worked all day, but my parents asked us to pick him up for them because my dad has trouble seeing at night. (He does have glasses but ya know, age). So we did them that favor.

It was established last week that my parents were going to pay for his Uber to the airport for his returning flight since it was so early in the morning and it would still be dark out. They live about 30 minutes from the airport.

My husband and I live about 15 minutes from the airport. Last night my mom called me and asked if they could drop my brother at our house on Friday (tonight) so he could Uber to the airport in the morning from us to save money. My mom told me it would be 75 dollars for him to get to the airport from their house. For the record, my husband checked himself and it would actually cost 35 dollars so I’m not sure where my mom got that number. 

If it were any other day it wouldn’t be a problem, but today is Valentine’s Day and my husband and I have plans. He’s cooking a nice dinner at home, I’m making dessert, and ya know-romantic husband and wife time. My brother sleeping over would kind of change the date night mood...

So I apologized but I told her that we had plans. We have other siblings who live in the area and I asked her if any of them could help out. And she acted a little short with me and told me that she and my dad would just take him. 

I feel a little guilty but I’m not going to let that change my mind because things have been hectic lately and my husband and I need the alone time. I also feel bad because I’m just getting over being sick, and we’ve both had work all week so we really didn’t get the opportunity to spend time with my brother. We see him about once a year, he lives states away. My husband says I shouldn’t feel bad but I can’t help it. So reddit, AITA?"	104	24

For months I was THE best friend. Constantly checking in, talking to the rest of her family, getting her other friends to check in, meeting her regularly (she's doesn't live that close), buying her gifts, saying nice things to her over Facebook. Just being as supportive as I possibly can.

Then her partner left her. They weren't happy for a long time. But she DID love him. After that she was saying all the right things. ""I don't want to be with anyone else, I want to be alone for a while"" shit we all say after a break-up.
Except she was doing the exact opposite. 
She immediately got a new boyfriend, called Malcom, who she then sort of cheated on *(with her half sisters ex boyfriend?!)* WTF no.

Then her and Malcom buy TWO new German Sheppard puppies (she's an awful dog ower, they all end up being given away). I wasn't happy so I told her off.

Then she's planning a baby with Malcom whom she's been with less than 3 months. They've already got 4 kids between them. Not long before this, I was supposed to go with her to the doctor to be sterilised..?? Again, I told her off.

THEN, she dumps Malcom! I was like? You've just had your implant taken out to plan a baby with him. You've chosen a name for this child (Luna, it's also my dogs name??). 
*she wants a moon face tattoo, probably more than the baby*

So Malcom looses his shit over text. He's threatening to come to her house, take one of the dogs and sell it to get his half of the money back. 
I don't like Malcom now, although I haven't met him

Another thing is, she's suddenly developed more serve mental health issues, like bulimia and panic attacks. I do feel for her, but I can't help thinking now she's attention from Malcom it's being put on (Or exaggerated a lot). She's saying she can't get a bus, or leave the house

And honestly, I'm SO busy, and feeling shit myself. I've got a lot going on and haven't been good recently. But I assumed she's got malcom and I've done my bit for a long time, I need to take a step back for myself ya know? 
She calls me yesterday. She wanted to see me today (I'm blanking her, I honestly can't mentally deal).
She wants me to stay at her house in a couple weeks, to look after her kids while her and malcom go to a metal music concert (she likes Lewis capaldi?)
 I've never looked after her children for the night, it costs me money to get there, and she apparently can't get a bus without a panic attack, yet can do this?!

 Also, I'm jealous. I feel like she's lied, cheated, manipulated and played a broken little girl, and men throw themselves at her, and everyone else jumps to help her or give her money/ favours.What should I do? I sort of hate her, but she's my only and longest friend"	4	9

Wine was flowing, and it was the best night out I’ve had in a while.

At the end of the night, I agreed I would pay and everyone would pay me back since they had my account number. As we were leaving in a slightly tipsy, celebratory chaos, my fiancé checked that I had indeed paid. I thought I had since I’d had my card on the table, but I also realized I was a bit drunk and wasn’t 100% sure. When I went back in to check, the waiter said the bill for my table was already paid. I made them double-check, even walked with him to the table to point it out and verified the amount (\~250€) and number of guests (6). It was paid in full. So I left, slightly confused.

Two days later, I still haven’t been charged (which is usually instant), and I’m fairly sure there was a mix-up. None of the other guests paid in secret, I double checked with them.

My sister says take the free meal, but I’m not so sure. I have a pic of the bill amount (to go Dutch with the guests), so I could resolve it with an email and still pay. WIBTA if I didn’t pursue this to fix the restaurant’s mistake?  My gut says yes, my maid-of-honor says no.

EDIT for info: In my country (NL), charges to debit cards are instant to the point of alerts on my phone app, so it definitely isn't delayed. Additionally (though maybe not super relevant), tips/mistakes are usually handled with a pooled pot (no single waiter assigned to one table), so it wouldn't come out of anyone's pay-check.

We hit it off and had a lot of the same interests, but due to her living over 4 hours away and attending school, we decided to stay friends.

Up until like 6 months ago i got a really good paying job and was able to save for a more reliable vehicle (which I got 2 weeks ago) as my daily vehicle was made in 1982 and couldn’t travel more than 70 miles without overheating. With this new vehicle came the ability to travel way longer distances and have 3x the mpg and it was reliable. 

So about 2 weeks before I got my new car I tested the water and flirted with her a bit since I knew I was about to get a new car, she would flirted back just as much.

At this point I would like to say that she and her best friend of 6 years got together 1 month prior and I had no idea.

As I got my new car, I was going to ask her out, But my work called and said that they are going to be posting everyone that wanted to work weekends and 12 hour days for overtime (mandatory) as the company was falling behind in product as the new models we are making are 2 months behind schedule due to designs. I happily said of course as I could always use the extra cash.

As I got off of a 12 hour shift, I sent her a Snapchat saying that I just got off work and hope she slept well (I normally work 11pm-7am, but have been working 7pm-7am).

When I get off work I chat with my dad for awhile as he works at the same place from 7am-3pm (no one really works 10 minutes after they arrive and 10 minutes before they leave), and then I head home and go to bed and wake up around 4pm.

She will normally just send a blank picture of herself in bed before she gets up for school. When I wake up I normally ask her how school/was etc. 

Well today I got a picture of her in bed, but her “best friend” was in the bed next to her kissing her head. I immediately asked why he was kissing her head and she said it’s cause they have been dating for 2 months.

This hurt me cause I considered myself good friends with her now boyfriend, and I felt this massive sense of regret and felt really bad. 

I continued to ask her why she would flirt with me and allow me to flirt with her if she had a boyfriend. She said that what she said it was nothing but complements and that she took my messages the same way. (For all those wondering, we would tell each other they “looked sexy” and “you hot as s***”.)

I don’t like conflict, so I just decided that that isn’t something I want in my life. So I blocked her, and messaged her boyfriend that I was sorry for hitting on her while they were in a relationship and didn’t know that they were in one, he responded and asked what I meant. But I told him that it’d probably be best to talk to his girlfriend and he hasn’t responded since. 

I have since received messages from her roommates that she is a mess right now because of me and what I did.

I just don’t know if I was an asshole for this

The street I've been living on for a few years is admittedly very sketchy because one of the bigger homeless encampments starts right across my street (literally). On my corner we have about 7-8 tents and a R/Vs and it goes further down adjacent roads. Just to set the scene. It's dirty and rats are everywhere.

That all being said I've never had or seen a bad experience while living on this street, the worst complaint I have is noise. My neighbor is ""friends"" with some of the homeless people that have been around for a long while and he told my neighbor that the homeless people do the best they can to not disturb the residents of the houses because they don't want the cops coming around as a result. 

Anyway. Last night I got home from a brutul 12 hour shift and didn't want to cook so I ordered food delivery around 8:45ish which arrived 9:30ish. It was dark but I make sure all the outside lights are on and I stand outside with my phone lit up to indicate where I am on the street. The delivery person though started bitching at me for ordering food which means they are walking outside their car in the dark near the homeless encampment. They called me selfish and basically threw the bag at me before literally running back to their car.

I think this person crazy overreacted to this situation and revoked their tip. They weren't going to be bothered in the 5 seconds it takes to get to my door from their car and running back to it was crazy. I told this story to my neighbor and he laughed but said he avoids ordering delivery after dark for this reason. 

AITA for ordering after dark? Tbh I don't think I'm going to stop completely but I want to know what other people think. I feel like putting all the outside lights on and my phone lit up is enough.

Tl:dr food delivery person mad I made them deliver after dark to a sketchy area but I don't think the area is so bad that I should keep people off it at night."	6	18

They're rich as hell (but it's all inherited from my great grandfather), and don't miss an opportunity to tell anyone and everyone that(including myself). Throughout my childhood years they've tried their best to not let me forget how much I owe them for my life by paying for all my clothes/high-school fees and the like. This is in addition to a lot of other unreasonable mandatory restrictions because I was living at their place and whenever I come back 'home'.

Fast forward a few years, and I've thankfully managed to graduate from a great college with a decent job. But now my parents are forcing themselves to pay the student debt loan. Now I know what you're thinking ""geez this guy's crying about having his debt practically waived? What a YTA move"" 
But the thing is if I let them pay I'll never hear the end of it and they'll definitely use it as an avenue of emotional blackmail in the future. I'm tired of them and I'd rather live with debt forever cut off from them. They're very toxic people and it shows why they don't have any friends apart from their siblings/my uncles and aunts.

Anyway, so coming to the judgment situation: We were at a family gathering where my parents were boasting as to how they're going to pay off my loan and how nice they are and have been since I was young and hopefully I'll be a ""good son"" in return and do the needful when they're older. I lost it and said something along the lines of not needing their money and hopefully today's the last day I'm going to see them and if they feel I'm not giving them back I can send them an approximate monthly payment for all the 18 years they've ""painfully"" raised me by using their granddad's money whilst sitting at home and doing nothing. 

Cue the crying and the 'you're being extremely disrespectful' shouting and how I've lost them face in front of other relatives.

Maddie had only met John before and Cody thinks he is a big lady killer but he’s really cringey and a major nice guy. 

Cody starts the whole night by asking Maddie what motivates her in life. First thing this dude has ever said to her. She makes up some crap and tries to avoid him. He keeps trying to flirt with her and I try not to visibly cringe. 

Much later, he asks her what her views on relationships are and she says she isn’t looking for one. 

Him, “Oh yea, me too. I’m just looking for friends.” 

They talk about basketball, she mentions a partner once challenged her to a game and if he won she would go on a date.

Him, “I’ll take that challenge. I know I could beat you.”

Her, “No thanks.”

Him, “how about we play for friends. If I win you have to be my friend.”

She didn’t really respond and started her car to leave soon after. I’m talking to Cody while she sits in the car waiting on Sarah. He says welp I’m gonna go try to get her snap. Walks to the car, opens the door and makes her add him. Twenty minutes after they left he opens Snapchat. She’s not on there. I tell him I don’t have her, he txts Sarah. I do too and she says that Maddie unadded him. 

I tell him he was horrible at flirting and that whole night was awkward for us because of it. He got mad and left before I woke up the next day. Haven’t heard from him in a week.

So about two months ago, I (18f) moved in with my MIL temporarily until my husband and I can get our shit together to get our own place. 

Before moving in with them, I had three guinea pigs. I brought them with me in the move and my SIL (16) loved playing with them and begged her mom to get her own. 

She ended up getting two guinea pigs off of Facebook marketplace and loved them for about a week. 

Since then, she has completely lost all interest in the both of them and she stopped taking care of them. 

Due to me not wanting to watch these two animals suffer, I have taken on the responsibility of feeding them and giving them water. I have bought all of thier food, vitamin supplements, and bedding. I am the one who brushes them, and clips thier nails, and lets them have time outside of the cage to run around. I keep thier cage and food bowls/hidey houses clean. 

My husband and I plan on moving out around July and I was wanting to take her guinea pigs with me. Would I be an asshole for doing so?"	3	13

We weren’t friends before I moved in. I found a room she advertised on a local Facebook housing group. She’s pretty hot and seemed to have a bustling social circle, and since I moved to this new city, I had to get in on that offer. Plus, our birthdays are only two weeks apart. Those things aren’t really important. I just wanted to share. She’s a great roommate and introduced me to some wonderful people. 


All the years I was living with other roommates, I was used to buying and consuming my own groceries by myself. We rarely shared. Maybe something like Sriracha but that’s it. However my new roommate is open to sharing her stuff. She says I can have whatever she has and I don’t need to ask her before having it. I said she could do the same for my stuff. 


Alright, so my peanut butter jar was empty and I’ve been too lazy to go to the store these past few days. I sometimes like to just scoop a big scoopful of peanut butter out of the jar with a spoon and just eat it little by little. I never double dip, even with my own jar. That’s because even a giant spoonful contains around 350 calories already. I don’t think she has seen me eat like that before. Well, I did just that late last night. 


My roommate was in her room. I went to the kitchen, opened her peanut butter jar and got a big spoonful to enjoy. Because I was hungry, I was eating the peanut butter before I closed the lid. I swear I was planning on closing it within 15 seconds. Well, my roommate came out of her room to ask me something. After I answered, she saw her opened peanut butter jar and me holding half of the big scoop of peanut butter on my spoon. 


She asked me if I was eating peanut butter straight out of her jar. I said I do that sometimes. She said that’s gross. She seemed very disgusted. I’m really good-looking for an Asian guy, but I know she’s not into me. I told her that I never double dip so there’s nothing unsanitary about what I’m doing. She said she can’t trust me and told me to stop using her foodstuff. I have no history of being unsanitary. 


Yes she’s a neat freak while I’m a step or two below that, but I’m no slop either. I really don’t know why she’s so aggressive. She never is. I told her that she has to trust me on this that I really wouldn’t violate her peanut butter since I don’t even double spoon dip mine. She said she can’t trust me and to please just stay away from her foodstuff from now on. 


I think she’s scared of contracting that disease everyone’s talking about from me. She sprays the whole house with alcohol every few hours and makes me wash my hands whenever I return home. I forgot once, so she reminds me every time now. She’s a bit high-strung lately. So I told her that I won’t touch her foodstuff anymore, but she needs to know that I’m not that gross. She said “whatever OP, good night.” She seems angry."	52	80

To preface this, I'm a shy person by nature and I tend to show it in my body language. I'll subconsciously cross my arms or legs when I'm anxious and getting a scalpel to my face hole makes me anxious. Anyway, I went to the oral surgeon to get my molars cut out and they were doing the whole check up thing before cutting into my mouth to make sure I wouldn't bleed out or whatever. As I'm sitting there I didn't realize I had my legs crossed, and this assistant lady was going to take my blood pressure. After she put the cuff on me she walked around to my legs and rather rudely grabbed my ankle, moved it, and plopped it down to uncross my legs. I didn't say anything to her about it but I thought it was unprofessional and I got a sense that she was annoyed and taking it out on me or something. She didn't say anything at all during the whole thing. She didn't ask me to uncross my legs before grabbing at me and she didn't say anything else to me afterwards. It just felt unprofessional, but maybe I'm just being a bit sensitive. AITA?	10	17

These are clubs I've been very active in so far and want to get more involved in, plus the leadership roles would be great when applying to grad schools since they are relevant to my major. 

However, I also am planning on studying abroad this spring (2021), which means I could only be in the roles, if I got them, for this summer and then fall. I haven't applied to or gotten the positions yet, nor have I officially been accepted to the study abroad program but it is likely I will be accepted to it since I'm just finishing up paperwork.

Part of my fear is that I don't know for sure if my study abroad program will happen with everything happening right now, since the summer and fall ones have already been cancelled, and if that happened I would still want something meaningful (like an exec position) to put on my resume since I'm applying to grad school right afterwards. Plus, I would like to have a leadership position anyways for that reason, especially in a club I genuinely am passionate about and active in. 

So being totally selfish it would definitely be better for me and my future to apply for these positions anyways, even though I would be leading 2/3 of the way through the term. But of course the club would then have to replace me early- though this year they did that for 2 people (not sure the reasons they left, just that they had early elections) so it's not completely unheard of for that to happen. The roles I'm in wouldn't be huge, instrumental roles, either, and I am a good fit for them so I do think I could contribute a lot for the time I was there. They would also have notice since I could tell them in Fall once I found out if I was going or not, so they would have ample time to replace me and I could work with the next person to help make a smoother transition.

I'm conflicted between my personal interest and what the right thing to do probably is. 

WIBTA if I applied for exec positions even knowing I'll likely be leaving next spring to study abroad?"	4	10

My famale friend was complementing my snapchat memories saying how hot I look etc.. to which I was playfuly saying ''Stop teasing me when you're lying''., to which she writes 'What the fuck you mean I'm being serious, take me seriously for once''.

To which I wrote ''I'm just saying how I feel haha''

Then she proceeds to write a whole paragraph how I never take what she says seriously and that I'm being a bi\*ch as always that I always critisize and never acknowledge her niceness and I ruin the nice vibe between us with my petiness and random reasons to create an argument.

Then says stop acting like a guy on period and fix how you approach to life/m

To which I write ''I'm not trying to make any arguments at all, you and your dad always bully me only your mom is nice to me (Jokingly) I didn't realise that she was being serious as I was really confused to what made her write all that for literally not much of a reason imo..

she then says ''I'm not talking to you bye''

I say don't you think your overexagerrating a bit? You're acting like I treat you like shit or something.

She then airs it, and we haven't spoken in few days, think its better this way, I don't know what kinda friend that is, she always lashes out at me for this and that, ''You don't message me enough'', ''I'm the one who messages always'', ''You never call me''...

About 2 months ago I (25F) was hanging out with my boyfriend (27M) in my apartment. We had sex and then I got in the shower. While I was in the shower my roommate (24M) came home. He knocked on the bathroom door, said he had to pee, and I told him that it was safe to come in (I was still in the shower and was behind a curtain). He peed and left. When I got out of the shower my boyfriend asked what all of that was about. I was confused and asked him what he meant. He was really upset that I allowed my roommate to come in while I was showering. He said that I was naked and my roommate had his dick out so he could have done something. I said, ""You think he was going to do something inappropriate? We have lived together for almost 3 years and I've known him since we were freshman in college. He's had way better opportunities to make a move than when I'm in the shower and my boyfriend is sitting in the next room."" He asked how often this happens and I told him that it doesn't happen often but does happen sometimes. When we first moved in together we always made sure to ask the other person if they needed to use the bathroom before we hopped in the shower. Now that we know each other's usual shower times we don't always ask. To us it really isn't a big deal if someone is peeing or brushing their teeth while the other person is showering. We argued about it for a while and then dropped it. Or so I thought.

I was FaceTiming my boyfriend yesterday and my roommate came home from work (essential employee). He picked up some dinner and put it on the table before walking away. I asked if he was going to eat now and he said that he was going to hop in the shower first but that I didn't have to wait for him and could eat now if I wanted. I told my boyfriend that I was going to call him back after I ate. He said ""Yeah, okay."" I asked what was wrong and he asked if I was really going to eat or if I was going to sit in the bathroom with my roommate and wait until he's done. I told him that I was just going to eat and he said, ""I don't know. You guys obviously can't take showers alone so maybe you should just join him in case he gets scared or something."" I realized that this was all about theo whole bathroom incident that happens 2 fucking months ago. I told him he was being ridiculous and he hung up and called me a bitch.

Am I missing something here. Was what we did that inappropriate? I grew up in a house with one bathroom and 3 siblings so we were always sharing the bathroom. I thought this was normal and my roommate clearly doesn't mind. AITA for not thinking this is a big deal even though I have a boyfriend?"	31	50

So, my friend has been decorating her house during quarantine, which is great! She has lived there for a few months and just now found the time to make it homey. She has been hemming and hawing over rugs, finally found one on Amazon, and purchased it. Cool!

They advised at time of purchase that there would be delays in shipping due to the Covid situation and trying to prioritize essential groceries, ok. She got frustrated after the tracker said out for delivery a couple of times and didn't come through. I told her there was probably a delay because it's a huge freaking rug. She didn't care and decided to cancel and get a refund. She gets her refund.

Lo and behold, it was still in transit and she gets the rug delivered finally. She plans on keeping it. I asked if she is going to reach back out to the merchant to complete payment again since she did end up getting the item. She said no. I said that feels wrong, she said sorry it feels wrong.

I've gone back into grocery stores to pay for an item if it was missed. I don't think of it as a jackpot. If it was just straight up Amazon, I don't even think I would feel as bad from how huge of a Corp they are. But smaller stores and merchants also use Amazon to get their products out there. A $300 rug seems steep to lose out on. The merchant is at a loss, not Amazon.

CONTEXT

Her - she works at a hospital, she has 2 younger brothers at home and her parents are in the danger age group*. Her parents also work full time in factory/assembly line jobs. 

Me - I work at a grocery store, 4 other siblings, 2 w/ asthma. 3 adults in the danger zone(age)* 1 not, total 4 adults. Only 3 of the 4 adults are working. My mother.  Step father, and step mother. Father is staying home due to an unknown(he knows I don't) heart issue. 

Location - Colder climate rn, the county we are in has a death toll that breached 1,000. And confirmed cases in the 10s of thousands. 

* Corona virus effects adults over a certain age group more severely, thus danger group.*

EOC
----------------------------
DILEMMA

She brings up us seeing each other.  Suggesting to break the quarantine. 

Her - Let's just go to a park I would like to see you I miss you
Her - Have a small picnic in the morning don't have to all morning just a picnic. 

Me - -REDACTED- it's very dangerous to do that rn 
Me - We could be carrying it rn and we would never know 

Her - I know sorry just a suggestion 

Me - Ik babe I miss you very very much ♥️ but we have to be smart about it ♥️♥️

Her - We FaceTime I love it don't get me wrong but I haven't seen you, how are okay with that ?

Me - -REDACTED- i want to see you more than anything ♥️ but it's not just me.  I am not a closed system.  My brothers are asthmatic, my step dad is old and your parents are old. 
Me - I am not ok with it babe 
Me - I hate it so much 

Her - You're right, I'm really sorry I'm just being selfish. 

Me - What you are feeling is 100% fine babe ♥️ don't be sorry 
Me - I don't want you to think that I don't care because I do. I can't tell you how many strangers I've told at work how much I miss you. And my employees ears I've made bleed taking about you.  
Me -  I'm not upset babe ♥️ I am very much in love with you. Its just very inconvenient and lonely that I cannot see you rn 😢.

OPINION
 People of Reddit. I feel like a huge butthead for turning her offer down, I would love to just throw away the rules and Romeo and Juliet this thing and meet up with her. But I have to think of my family. And I care about her family too. Grocery retail isn't the safest rn either. I could spread it to her or vice versa.

Since today happens to be my country's Reunification Day, I thought about this incident that happened between me and a Vietnam vet earlier this year. I do that believe that I am not an ass here; however, I am looking for thoughts from strangers on the Internet, especially those from the US to see if there's something that I failed to take into consideration. 

  
The Vietnam veteran mentioned is my friend's father. We were having a casual hangout when the topic of wars came up. The friend and I were talking about my upbringing as a Vietnamese. We then talked about a time back in our college years when there was a voluntary event on Veterans Day and it was about writing thank you cards to the veterans. I chose not to participate because my cards may be sent to Vietnam veterans, which to me as a Vietnamese, was not right. I maintained that I would not be thanking any Vietnam veterans for their service. His dad overheard then got offended by that statement so he came over to tell me that he was a Vietnam veteran and that he was disappointed in my attitude.  

  
His argument was that I am too young to understand what happened back then and that it was a difficult time for both sides of that war. That he was fighting for his country and deserved some respect for doing so. And that he, among others, still suffer from it. I was seeing red at this point. I told him that I would not thank him for killing my people and that no matter how he put it, it was my country that suffered the most. That I didn't need need to grow up during that time to grasp the severity of such impact. I also told him that if he wanted to talk about suffering then he should know all the shitty things the US military did to my country then still affect Vietnamese families to this day, namely the Orange Agent. 

  
He was fuming and so was I. The friend was definitely regretting talking about it at all. We are cool but no so much between me and the dad ..."	1	2	1.0

Slowly but steadily. Over that time I’ve been taking it more and more seriously to increase the quality of my uploads as I feel that’s just what I’m supposed to do in such a situation.
Enter my Toxic Friend (TF) who can do a somewhat good impression of the character Super Mario. I mentioned how I wanted to do a Mario themed video to celebrate reaching 10k subs and had found a really good VA who could also do an impression of the character.
I didn’t know TF could do an impression and even if I had known I still wouldn’t put TF in my videos because of his rampant toxicity.
Constant name calling and degrading of me and our other friends during our game sessions coupled with a serious try hard attitude in all situations has pretty much made me want him as far away from my YT videos as I possibly can make him. I keep bringing up his toxic behaviour and he continually uses his Aspergers as an excuse to treat me and the others like garbage.
The problem is now he’s claiming I won’t give my money to him because of his aspergers and is threatening to cancel me on social media if I don’t hire him to do the Mario voice instead of the actor I contacted already.
I’m not worried about being cancelled but I am worried if I’m being ignorant of his mental condition as I just don’t think having aspergers is an excuse to treat a friend so badly."	5	11	0.73

This in itself isn’t a problem. I could care less his preference for drink temperature.

I  on the other hand hate drinking warm or room temperature drinks of any sort and always refrigerate my drinks prior to consuming them. I typically put 3-4 cans of soda in the fridge which would last me 2-3 days. Any time I do this my boyfriend drinks several/all of them in a day.

He now leaves me a single can, he will give me a big grin and say “I didn’t drink them all, you can replace them since you’re drinking the last one.” And it’s honestly upsetting to me because it’s him basically acknowledging that he is drinking them all but taking zero responsibility.

The only thing worse is when he drinks everything and tells me it’s “not a big deal” to drink warm sodas. I have tried to bring it up with him that if he finds it no different he either needs to drink the sodas that aren’t refrigerated, or replace the chilled ones as he is drinking them.  He then tells me cold ones are better and I am being selfish by expecting to replace him to replace mine.

He often flat out denies/gaslights that he is the one taking them but it’s just the two of us living together, he denies it even when there are empty cans are sitting on his desk. Telling me I didn’t fill it up etc, when I do just about every day before I leave for work. 

Today I had a mental breakdown when I got home because he began gaslighting me again telling me I hadn’t put the cans into the fridge even though I had texted him in the morning about it. He never admits that he is gaslighting until I show him proof of the thing he is denying, and when I did today he was smiling the whole time and started laughing, saying it’s ok you can just drink a warm one or one of the waters you put in there.


I feel like I am going insane and I broke down crying and sobbing, begging him not to do it anymore and that I feel awful when he acts the way He does when I’m mildly upset or annoyed. When I bring up that he is gaslighting me he says “I’m obviously joking” and what he does isn’t gaslighting, but it doesn’t feel like a joke and I honestly feel nuts because I doubt myself and feel like I need to write everything down or check back in my messages to make sure I did do something, or to prove to him that it did happen.

If I get mad and demand for him to go to the fridge and restock it with the ones he has drank he tells me I am insane and need to get a grip on my life because it’s “just a can of soda” but it’s less to do with not having a can of cold soda but rather the constant lack of respect or willingness to understand or empathize that this is an issue that is frustrating to me because it’s such a small thing and I’m not asking him to even do anything extra for me, just maintain the effort I have put into something.

My wifes family, or more to the point my MIL is very strict and rigid Mormon, my wife after feeling bullied in church still follows being Morman to an extent but in a far more relaxed way.

When we had our first child now 6 both me and my wife sat down to discuss how we would approach religion with our kids as I am not religious in any way however she is a practicing Mormon.

My personal view is that children under 8-10 shouldn't be involved in the church scene, this is because a standard is set in a child's routine that church is something they have to go to. However if this is how people choose to raise there children that is their choice and I keep my nose out of it but would hope the same courtesy is given to me and mine.

My personal view that I explained to my wife is that until the kids are old enough to understand religion being explained to them (any religion not just LDS) that we would sit them down and talk through religion with them and if they chose to visit or partake in any religion we would support it. I had said at maybe age 6, but my wife said we should wait till their each 8 as they would understand it better by then, we were both in agreement so she told her family about our choice.

The conversation with her family went fine with her dad and her sister, however things have not gone so well with the MIL. Early on if the kids were spending time at her house, so long as her husband wasn't around she would be making my kids pray before being allowed food. I know I'm the arsehole when I complain to my wife about it but it's less drama for her if I moan to her rather than her mother or she gets an earful for weeks.

The MIL has drilled it into our oldest so much that even when he hadn't seen his grandmother for a couple of weeks (Covid-19 an all that) suddenly at a meal he start spouting a prayer. I asked him straight away what it meant, he said he didn't know but had to say it to eat.

Me and my wife both made sure he knew food was never contingent on any prayer or prerequisite, that food is always there when he needs it no strings attached.

No matter how often we revisit this with my MIL she backs off for a week or two then starts forcing religion back on my kids again and the cycle goes on.

Ex husbands girlfriend.	https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/gqm91u/aita_ex_husbands_girlfriend/	"Ok so a little back story, my exhusband has been with his girlfriend for a little bit now, he and i have a 2 year old daughter together. Last month I had To have surgery and my exhusband said he would take off work for 3 days to keep our daughter. Long story short the morning of my surgery he said he wasn’t taking off and was leaving my daughter with his girlfriend. At this point I had no choice I had to let her keep my daughter.

So the past few times when we meet for my daughter he brings her now and before he hands her to me he takes our daughter around the car to give his girlfriend kisses. Tonight I said can you please do that before you guys leave the house or before I get here so I don’t have to see another woman kissing on my daughter. I was very polite about it. I even said it’s nothing against Her, it bothers me to see another mother figure in my place kissing on my kid. I should add that my daughter was snoring she was so dead asleep so it wasn’t her choice, that would have been different.

He went off saying what she is good enough for you to make her watch her but not good enough to give her a kiss? I explained the situation that it just hurt me to see to please just not do it in front of me.

We have a pretty great relationship, we’ve never really argued over anything and it’s all pretty chill. Up until just now, where I’ve found myself upset by the stupidest thing.

My girlfriend keeps buying me gifts. They’re not necessarily expensive, but in the last month, she’s bought me a personalised picture frame of us both and now a personalised mug. I do appreciate the gifts but I literally don’t know where to store them. Also, I’m not an overly affectionate person and I find these gifts kind of awkward, especially as I still live with my parents as I’m saving to move out. I don’t do decorations with love quotes or any of that cheesy stuff. 

I have asked before if she would stop buying me gifts. It makes me uncomfortable, probably because it makes me realise I’m not as thoughtful as she is. I think the problem may lie in the fact that this is her first long-term relationship and I’m more over that ‘honeymoon phase’? Another issue is that my parents aren’t completely okay with my sexuality, so I feel that I can’t confidently display these items - internalised homophobia, I know. 

When I found out about the mug tonight, I felt exasperated. I tried to politely convey my frustration that I’ve already told her numerous times that I wish that she would stop buying me things and surprising me like this. I have already mentioned that I hate surprises due to my anxiety which she has somewhat taken into account, but the random gifts continue. I feel like an ungrateful asshole, but I really don’t want these gifts. I’m not angry anymore, I just hope I haven’t hurt her feelings.

My dad sobered up years ago and has long since remarried and we have a decent relationship. However, my mom never did. She had 2 other kids that were also taken away years after me. I was raised by other relatives and have since moved from the USA to the UK.

My mother never once made an effort to meet me, and to this day i've never met her in person, nor have i met my siblings or even know where they are. Over the course of my life i made numerous attempts to make contact with her and she backed out at the last second every time, up until i moved. She made the effort for once and i turned her down because i was fed up with her at that point and didn't care to know her.

Skip to now, i have a 9 month old son and am happily married to a sweet and silly Welsh man and my dad thinks i'm in the wrong for saying i dont want my mother in my son's life and that she has the right to know her grandson. He's giving me hell for it and really making me feel bad saying ""she's changed give her a chance"" and to not ""judge her based on her poor decisions when she was my age because she's better and wiser now"". I know for a fact she hasn't changed. I simply said if my son wants to have a connection with her when he's older that's up to him and i won't mind, but since she made no effort with me i'm making no effort with her. I dont send her photos, dont talk to her, none of that and she makes minimal effort still if any at all. She's a bad influence in my opinion and tries too hard to be ""cool"", from what i've seen and heard and is still on drugs despite claiming being sober.

But the Bible says to love others and not to judge, so when my best friend came out to me in high-school and told me he was gay, I told him I was here for him.

And I really was. I was there when he came out to his parents and they kicked him out the house; I was there when he needed a place to stay and I let him crash at my house for the rest of senior year; I was there to console him when he went through various break-ups with different boyfriends; etc.

Through all this, he knew my stance on homosexuality. I never forced my views onhim, but whenever he would catch me reading my Bible, he would teasingly ask me if I thought homosexuality was a sin and that he was going to hell. I would tell him, ""I don't know where you're going or where I'm going. Ultimately, that's for God to decide. As far as homosexuality, I don't think you can help who you're attracted to. But I do think you can choose who you sleep with. So, yes, I think it's a sin. But we're all sinners.""

The reason why I mentioned that is because it was never a secret to him that I didn't approve of his lifestyle. It's been twenty years now, and my stance has been the same: I don't approve of some of the things you do, but I still love you for who you are. 

I recently got a call from him  (we haven't since each other since Covid, but we talk reguarly) and he said he had something to tell me. I said, ""Sure, go ahead."" He sounded excited and I was curious. He took a deep breath and then said he had recently got engaged to his boyfriend (a guy we both knew). I said, ""Hey, man, as long as you're happy, I'm happy for you."" And I was genuinely happy for him.

Then he says, ""I have to tell you something else. I want you to be my best man.""

Dead silence. 

Long story short, I tell him that I really wish I could, but I can't. He gets angry and hangs up. I try to call him back - straight to voicemail. I text him - no reply.

Look, I can understand why he's upset, but I can't budge on this. This is too far for me. Weddings to me are literally symbolic ceremonies of approval. The families and friends all come together and the pastor asks, ""If anyone has any objections speak now or forever hold your peace.""

And my friend knows me. For the twenty plus years we've known each other I've never hid the fact that I. don't. approve. I have no problem visiting him after the wedding is over, or sending him a gift, but I can't in all good conscience stand there in silence when the pastor asks, ""Does anyone object?""

I just can't. I'm not going. And I'm going to keep reaching out to my friend (unless he makes it absolutely clear that he's done with me). One of my worries as a Christian has always been am I being too strict, too traditional? But on this one, I just can't. 

WIBTA if I don't go to the wedding?

**Edit 1 (Thank Yous)**: Thank you for all the comments below. I'm reading every single one. There were several comments and criticisms that really cut me to the core but I purposely refrained from answering anyone because I felt it would comes across as me trying to justify my actions or beliefs.  I just wanted people's honest perspective and opinions. 

For the people that reached out to me behind the scenes, thank you for the kind words, the support, and the advice. There are too many to respond to, and I will try my best to get back to you, but if I don't, just know that I am humbly grateful for both your concern and the correction alike.

Many people were asking me for updates, so:

**Edit 2 (Update)**: My best friend didn't answer any of my calls today, so I'm thinking about leaving him a text tomorrow basically saying: **""I know how much this had to have hurt you and I apologize for not communicating with you more about this earlier on to avoid all of this. But in my heart, I genuinely consider you my best friend, but I feel my absence in this situation is necessary. And I hope that one day doesn't invalidate the 20 years of friendship we've had.""**  I've been tweaking it here and there, but I'll be posting it in another thread to ask for suggestions on ways to make it better. I feel like it's missing something. But this is my last comment.

**Edit 3 (Final Words)**: Whoops! Okay, not my last comment, apparently. Many people in the chats were requesting me to keep them updated on future developments if any, and there are too many requests to personally message individually so I'll just post them here. 

**Edit 4 (Answer to a Question)**: Someone messaged me, asking ""Why are you making this so public? Stop being an attention seeker!"" This is a paraphrased, less-explicitive filled version of what they actually said, but to address it:

**1)** Well, for one I wasn't expecting the overwhelmomg amount of responses I recieved. I didn't know this was going to blow up like it did. I was just expecting a few answers and that was it, but f there was a way I could show you all the stories people - religious, nonreligious, homosexual, nonhomosexual - have messaged me about the things they've been through, and the sacrifices they've had to make, there's many that are heart-warming and many that are heart-wrenching.

**2)** Once I saw the responses pouring in, and the different perspectives everyone had on both sides of the spectrum, and the true emotions underlying it all, I realized that this could be beneficial in some way to any people who come across these comments in the future and are struggling with reconciling their religion, their beliefs, and their convictions to their relationship with others who it may effect. Someone may one day find this post, read one of your comments, and find something that they can apply to themselves."	147	430	0.7

It took a while but I finally completed the application and received my first payment. 

So my mum asks if I had received it and starts lecturing me on what I should and shouldn't spend it on. Most of it was well intentioned advice i.e. set some aside for emergency savings ect. But then it took a weird turn. She started criticising me for buying fruit and exercise equipment (from before I received the payment) and not trainers and clothes. I just thought we had a difference in priorities and my mum could be a bit pushy on what she thinks is right. then she said ""even though I told you about it you couldn't even offer me £10"" I knew she wasn't being serious so I jokingly said ""so because you told me about it you want me to pay you"".

My mum got a bit defensive about this and I replied ""but that's literally what you said. Because you told me about the benefit scheme I should at least offer you some of the money"". Then she started to explain her reasoning in longer terms saying stuff like without her I wouldn't have known about it and that I should show some appreciation. I don't necessarily disagree with this and I know that she didn't seriously want money from me but in literal terms she said because she let me know about it I should at least offer her some of the money. 

So this is fun... Midway through writing this post she called me over for a ""conversation"" consisting of me remaining silent and my mum speaking about a bunch of unrelated topics lumping them together as ""her duty as a mother"". She even started crying (idk why I literally didn't say anything). After she was done and I was allowed to speak I said "" first of all I allowed you to speak for a long time without interruption will you allow me to do the same?"" To which she replied ""that was an unnecessary statement, i called you over to have a conversation why are you making it sound like I won't let you"" so I said ""then say yes you will"" to which she said ""I don't have to bow down and obey you to say yes"". So I left.

(Didnt know I'd grow that fast, I didnt with my other kids) my moms running around talking to everyone, so I call her in to help me zip up. 

She thinks that would be the perfect time to launch on me that she wanted my step dad to walk me down the aisle. I told her no, that my pepaw was going to walk me down the aisle, as I had already talked to him about it. My mom tells me that my pepaw had called her and told her that he didnt feel good, and he wouldnt be coming. I dont blame him, hes in his 60's, and he is watching over my great grandparents as they are in their 90's now. 

My mother then says since my pepaw isnt coming that my step dad could walk me down the aisle. Now I'm pregnant,  I'm uncomfortable since I never wear dresses, nor do I like having alot of people in a small room.  The idea me and my husband agreed on, was having my mom and his parents come over, have my pastor cousin do a small ceremony,  us sign the papers and be done but my mother threw a fit, so i agreed on a small ceremony,  consisting of my husbands parents, his aunt and uncle their 2 kids, and my mom and step dad, my uncle his wife and their two kids. 

But anyway, I'm getting off subject, I'm sorry, I'm scatterbrained. 

I told my mom no, that I would just walk by myself. She pouted and says that I was going to break his heart. They havnt been married long. They only met 6 years ago, and hes spent 3 of those in jail. 

So AITA for not letting my stepdad walk me down the aisle?"	3	17	0.62

As doctors did not know what to do it was up to me to care for her for three weeks. I would be up at six A.M. leave for my internship or school and then come back in the evening around 6 P.M. if I was lucky. From 6 P.M to 7 P.M I would cook dinner, bring it to my mom, check her health, make sure she drank enough, ensured that she did not need me to help her around the house and then rush downstairs to eat my own dinner before that got cold. I would start cleaning the house, do the dishes by hand and try to relax for about 15 minutes before I needed to help her again and ensure that she was alive. Basically I was a young carer without a support system. Around the time I was done, I would need to destress and get ready for school or the internship for the next day and go to sleep.

I was burning out and fast. I asked my mom mutiple times to let others help me take care of her and the household as I also had homework and could not do it because the health of my parent was more important then my grades. Her reaction: ‘We will be fine together, we always have done it together, so we will manage.’ Or in other words OP will manage and just do her job in taking care of her parent. I did this for a whole three weeks, I actually broke my promise to my mom to speak with my school in order to ensure that I would not have to drop out since I could not finish homework and exams were approaching. After three weeks I finally had enough and asked one family member to help, they did not want to.

Proceeding to the situation. Not that long ago my mom approached me and started telling me that she.  ‘Felt like she had no daughter for she had not been visiting her in the hospital for two weeks in total. As if I had forgotten her.’ Those two weeks were seperate from each other, and the first of the two was me trying to push myself through exams while being exhausted from all the stress and being depressed. The second week I needed to finish some papers, and could not focus upon my mom while she was safe in the hospital. I thought since she finally was somewhere they could treat her illness at, that it would  be a good time to ensure my own future. Was I in the wrong here? She also proceeds to still talk about it as if it was a nightmare, but believes that for me it was just like walking upon a frigging rainbow and that I have not done enough for her. That I have not made the right decisions in ensuring my own future instead of spending time with her."	20	34	0.9

Apologies in advance for editing, on mobile. 

So me (26f) and 3 friends (Kyle 28m, John 30m and Emma 28f) went on holiday to somewhere considerably hotter than our home country. Being Scottish, sun cream is fairly vital. 

Emma and I went out to the beach before the guys and slathered ourselves up before tanning and swimming. We headed into the water as the guys came down so they could mind our stuff but after 5 minutes Kyle waves at us to come in. I came back up and asked what he wanted. He said John refused to help put sun cream on his back because touching another guy would be gay. The thought process behind that is just too bizarre as none of us are gay, and why on earth would that even remotely matter anyway?! I was pissed - both for getting me out the water and for being a homophobic moron! I ended up getting into a slightly heated conversation with John because wtf right?! 

I helped Kyle out with his back and John then asked if I could do his. I thought this was bold considering I’d just been pretty nippy with him. I asked him if Kyle could do his back and he said no. Again just totally fucked up mentality! So I said ok, but instead of using the sun cream I grabbed aloe lotion (no sunblock at all). 

John ended up lying out for a long time and the next day he had fairly bad burns all over his back. He was pretty laid up for the rest of the trip and spent a lot of time inside or in a tshirt. 

Kyle thought it was hilarious, obviously John thinks I’m a total asshole and Emma is slightly leaning towards me being an asshole. So AITA?"	24	25	0.84

My dad runs his own business and has ever since I was young. My mom used to help him run the paperwork side of it. This business has created a lot of stress and tension in our family. I have always helped my dad when I could, even with very physically demanding tasks. 

I am currently working most every day of the week, 8 hour shifts. I am also taking online classes right now so that I can finish my degree on time. So, when I am not at work I am doing schooling. My sisters (15F and 19F) are not working currently. My dad has needed help recently because he can't really find employees, so they have been helping him. 

My mother is a stay at home mom. I understand that this is a job and it can be very demanding. BUT! She doesn't exactly do anything at all. She sits around, spends the money that my dad works hard for, and complains. She is a good person and I love her, but this is something that I can't stand. She stopped helping my dad with his business a while ago because it was taxing on her I guess. Anytime my dad needs help and asks her, she acts as if something simple is such a chore and how dare he ask her of anything business related. 

I have an off day and my sisters are going to help my father with work. I tell them I am not going (as I am doing homework) and my sisters and mother get furious with me. I have recently helped him with what I could and will do so in the future, but right now I am busy.

Every summer me and my parents go to visit some of my parents in Turkey, Istanbul. Let's call my relative Sally. Sally has been teasing me (20M at the time) for not having a girlfriend. Sally has 2 kids and she's married to a military veteran. 

Her teasing has always been kinda friendly nothing serious. But that year however she kinda decided to delve deeper into it.  The teasing was more often and more serious. She was telling me that it's embarrassing for me to not have a girlfriend at this age.

It got to a point where I was pretty much a time-bomb, ready to explode at her, which I eventually did. 

For a little context she saw her husband like twice before they both decided to get married. He's currently constantly working and his own kids barely get any  time with him.

So this is what she told me which kind of got me to snap. ""It's a very bad look for a young man like you, at this point you're embarrassing both yourself and your family"". 

I really wouldn't have snapped at her and I really could've ignored what she said like the multiple times before. But what enraged me was that she brought it when we were talking about something completely unrelated and everyone including my own family agreed with her. 

This is what I said : ""I'd rather be single at this age than marry someone who I've seen only twice! Have two children who can barely see their own father and to have myself and my kids live in a perpetual fear of whether he's going to ever come back!"" 

I stood up and shouted all of the above and then went to a room, put on my headphones and I listened to music for the rest of the night.

My parents told me in the morning that I shouldn't have said that and they were kinda pissed of at me.

Here's the thing. I love Sally, she's an amazing person. She has always been kind and helpful to me. We shared some common interests. I feel bad for telling her this and this my point of view.

He’s always been pretty rude to mom, as a result I’m a lot closer to mom. 

My brother is very shy, he’s always been into gaming. Through his teenage head he’s formed what I now assume is a gaming addiction. He plays all day and night, and has really no life outside of the game.

To set things into perspective, we went to the same middle schools in 7-8th grade. I was in charge of his report cards, letters, teacher conferences, translating, all the good stuff. It was stressful because I sometimes couldn’t even keep up with my stuff. I’d get shit for doing something wrong.

He was literally failing science in 8th grade and I had to beg his teacher to give him extra work (he was also my teacher) so he wouldn’t fail the year. As a freshman he for MONTHS skipped school to play games. Mom literally got a letter saying she’d have to go to court if this continues. We only found he skipped because mom caught him one day. She didn’t even punish him either, because “he’ll get bored and have morning  to do” the second time she only took the damn thing for 2 days. 

Here we are again, going to the same school. Due to covid we did online schooling. You can guess where that went. He’d turn in things that weren’t done so mom would se he turned in work. As a result he got summer school and I had to literally email his teacher when he needed help because, as my mom says “he won’t do it right”

I constantly feel like the pressure is on me. It’s not like i haven’t even tried to do something about it. I proposed she take the xbox away so he can focus but she never did. 

Until today.. I was so done, so stressed, I’m going through a rough patch myself. I literally saw red when mom began yelling at him, then me. I just stood up, I swear all noise was shut down. I unplugged his brand new xbox and threw it out our balcony (we live on the third floor) I ended up smashing his TV as well. 

He’s demanding I pay him back, and mom is mad at me because as she says it wasn’t my place to do that. I feel like I’m always the one who ends up suffering, all because of this damn game. So AITA?"	4	20	0.67

She makes them for the holidays and family gatherings and people always request that she brings them. I asked for the recipe once and she laughed and said no - that it was ""hers"" and she doesn't give it out to anyone. I dropped it and never asked again.

I started baking a LOT during the pandemic. It's been fun for me in my downtime. I decided with my free time to try to recreate the cookie bars my boyfriend's mom makes. I pulled up recipes that sounded similar from online blogs and started baking and tweaking. It took about 5 recipes and batches but I finally nailed it down (her secret recipe ended up essentially being a cookie bar known as a Carmelita).

I then decided to make it ""my own"" and improve it to my tastes. I used higher quality chocolate, made sauce with local homemade caramels, used flakey sea salt on top, vanilla bean paste instead of extract, added a pinch of this fantastic organic cinnamon I had on hand. The results were over the top delicious. My boyfriend declared they are better than his mom's and he finished off half a pan in 2 days.

He was Facetiming with his mom Saturday and eating one. She asked what it was and he said ""One of your caramel bars. Jo found a recipe online but made it even better."" SHE LOST IT. She started yelling about how awful I was for making ""her"" cookies and how I had no right. He told her that she was overreacting and quickly ended the call.

She started blowing up my phone with nasty texts about what an asshole I am. I explained to her that I found the recipe I used online where it was very public, I had actually tweaked that to make it more my own, and that I wasn't ever planning on bringing them to an event she's at so I did not see what the big deal was. She didn't care. She called me names and told me I was wrong for baking a recipe that I knew was similar to hers. She isn't speaking to me or her son.

While I don't think my boyfriend should have made the comment about how I ""made it even better"" to his mom...taking that out of the equation she thinks I'm an asshole for even making them to begin with. I disagree, but from the texts from her and a couple other family members of hers, they think I crossed a line. AITA for recreating this recipe?

\*\*Edit to add this, since people are asking - and edit to correct that I make my caramel sauce WITH homemade caramels from a local shop:

I used the recipe below for the ""base"" for my bars, but then made the tweaks I mentioned above. I used high quality chocolate, homemade caramels from a local candy place, I add 1Tbs of vanilla bean paste into my caramel when I melt it, and a pinch (probably 1/4 tsp. or less) of a very mild organic cinnamon into the oatmeal mixture. I top it with flakey sea salt. They are GREAT the regular way though, because the tweaks I made to my last batch (the batch that got me in trouble because they were declared better than the inspiration) add up in price quickly.

She keeps on going so I say ""alright im busting out the headphones."" Not to only dull out her noise, but to show that what she's doing is annoying.

I (22f) have known Matt (22m) my entire life, ever since we were babies. We went to school together, we went on holidays together, our families are very close and I've always considered Matt my brother.

Matt also considers me his sister and best friend, and even though we didn't go to the same college, we still kept in touch as he lives 5 minutes away from me, so we always hang out, play games, go to concerts together etc.

His girlfriend (Jessica, 20f) *hates* me. They've only been together for three months, but she made it clear she does not approve of our 'relationship', as she believes I'm in love with Matt and she wants him to stop talking to me for good. Matt dismissed her, he explained I'm family to him and he won't stop talking to me ever, even if it makes her uncomfortable. 

I can hear her talk shit in the background every time we play games, as they live together now because she didn't want to go back home when the pandemic happened. Matt wasn't planning on moving in with her this soon, but he felt bad for her, as she had nowhere to stay. Every time I visit Matt, she rolls her eyes and acts very bitchy. Sometimes she refuses to even open the door. I was silent about everything as I didn't want to cause a fight, but that changed last night.

Yesterday, Matt invited a few friends over, since we haven't seen each other in a while. Jessica was there as well, of course. She seemed very angry I was invited too, but I tried to ignore her, since it's obvious she hates my guts. We were drinking and playing card games, generally having a good time. One of our friends suggested we start planning our next trip and that's when Jessica lost it. She said it's creepy how desperate I am to hang out with her boyfriend, that I probably want to go on this trip so I can get him drunk and fuck him, and that I'm not welcome in her house.  Everyone was sort of speechless, I believe they thought she was joking, but I was furious. Matt was getting angry too, as he has told Jessica multiple times he considers me his sister. One of the guys tried to lighten up the mood and made a joke about her being too drunk, but she wouldn't stop. 

I admit I lost it. I was drunk too, I know that's not an excuse, but I am sick and tired of this girl's attitude towards me. I simply told her 'You're mental. This is not your house, if you have a problem with me, why don't you just fuck off?' She started crying and cursing Matt for not siding with her, then she went and locked herself in 'her' room.

I woke up with a massive hungover and dozens of texts from our friends telling me I went a bit too far. Jessica still refuses to talk to Matt, Matt wants to break up with her because of the disgusting things she said, on top of that I got a message on Facebook from Jessica's best friend, telling me it's my fault Jessica will be homeless. I'm livid. I don't know if I am the asshole here, so I need your judgement."	191	41	0.97

However, my labor with her was traumatic, physically and mentally. I won't go into graphic details but I required two additional surgeries. This was especially hard right after she was born because of postpartum hormones, and the stress of new parenting. I went through months of depression and though I am much better, I still deal with at least minor physical repercussions on an almost daily basis.  
I am pretty open with how I talk about my labor, especially with close female friends and relatives. I don’t feel like my needs were totally met by the medical community during or after labor and I think talking about it openly can help destigmatize birth trauma and injury so women aren’t afraid to bring up these issues for themselves. It’s also cathartic for me. I have talked about it to a therapist but I’m sure I could use more therapy.  
The other night my husband and I somehow got to talking about this topic. I told him that it bothered me that sometimes I would be talking about my labor and he would interrupt to correct some minor detail. The example I brought up is that I’ll say I was in labor for almost 24 hours and he’ll say “It wasn’t that long”. It was literally 23 hours plus an hour of surgery. And he’ll say other things that imply he doesn’t think it was that bad. It makes me feel dismissed and like he’s trying to minimize what I went through. We talked about it more and he said that he worries that even though I don’t say these things in front of our daughter, that it could get back to her someday and make her feel guilty or unwanted. He brought up how his siblings would always tease him for being an “oops” baby and how bad that made him feel.  
In general, my husband doesn’t like talking about the negative aspects of life. I think he feels that lingering on traumatic things is unhealthy or invites negativity. I on the other hand, like getting everything out in the open, getting other people’s thoughts and opinions. It makes me feel comforted and I think it gives me more confidence in my own feelings, if that makes sense.

I feel like I have a right to talk about what I went through and I would never say anything around my daughter to make her feel like it was her fault or that I resent her. I see the experience of labor and her birth as completely separate and in my mind the two aren’t related at all. But, I can see when she’s older finding out these things could make her feel bad. So, reddit, am I the asshole for not keeping this experience between me and my therapist?

While we’re gone, my MIL drops by to visit my mom, who’s staying with my sister from out of town (my mom and MIL are friends). I’m not sure how it happened, but they decided it would be a great “anniversary surprise” to freshen up our house. 

The house was by no means dirty or even particularly messy before leaving, but they dusted, rearranged things in our kitchen, cleaned out the fridge and bathtubs, etc. My mom convinced MIL not to go into our bedroom and my office, and tried multiple times to stop her from going into my husband’s office, but she went in and tidied/rearranged all of his things. 

When we came home, we felt pretty violated, as we are private people and we had things arranged to our preference. My husband especially felt violated because a) he’s had conversations about boundaries with his mom in the past and b) he works and relaxes in his office and it is his safe space.. we even closed the door to his office before we left and thought that would be a good indication for people to not go in there.

Anyway, it basically put a damper on the rest of the day and we had a chat with our moms about respecting our boundaries, etc. They apologized, but are we the AHs for getting upset? Our moms are so good to us (they even gave us some cash towards a nice dinner for our anniversary), and we appreciate the gesture.. but we just feel disrespected and violated. It’s not that hard to text/call and ASK first, IMO.

Edit: My mom is my landlord, my husband and I pay her rent for the top floor, and my sister pays her rent for the basement apartment. I told my mom and sister it was okay for them to hang out if needed while we were gone, as we were in the middle of a heat wave and we have AC. My sister was under the impression that they were just going up to take our recycling to the depot because that is what they told her."	227	38	0.96

\---

The day starts normally, I get up, do everything necessary and get out to work.

Now I work at a restaurant as the dishwasher guy, that means that I don't have constant work. I get a wave of dishes and then I have a few minutes free until the next wave.

I do my work and now the few minutes start, I open my phone to see what's going on and oh-oh a discussion about a guy who has been racist, sexist, and homophobic started on a discord server. Now I joined the discussion since I knew something about the situation and started chatting. Now this is normal at my job, the cooks use their phones and everyone does in their free time.

I was using my phone more than usual that day because of the discussion.

A few minutes after I got into the discussion one cook said ""You're using your phone too much, it's demotivating and rude, why don't you wipe the ceiling?"" (The ceiling is pretty low, It's too tall for me in some spots)

Now I didn't do this, I thought it's plain stupid to tell a 14 year old kid who works 10 hours a day that he's on his phone too much even though the phone usage doesn't affect anything about his work and he still does his work as intended and then command him to wipe the ceiling which doesn't even makes sense or a difference.

I started using my phone less often that day but still more than normal, the discussion ended in everyone rebelling against the guy btw.

anyways I have some notes:

The cook himself uses his phone aswell and pretty often, however I saw that instead of being in a discussion or chatting with someone he reads *articles*.

I think the cook has something against me, he always tells me that I need to do something when I have free time in the kitchen and most of the time even tells me to clean his part of the kitchen.

The cook probably just wanted me off of my phone as if he has a break he doesn't wipe the ceiling but reads articles.

**I didn't say anything in my defense, I was quiet and let him bash me as I was afraid of being yelled at since he is the one who is the most vocal about his opinions in the work place.**

**TL;DR** I got commanded to wipe the ceiling of a kitchen because I was too much on the phone discussing stuff like racism, homophobia and sexism. furthermore the guy knows I'm 14 and working 10 hours a day.

so, AITA For using my phone too much at work?

The apartment has those faux-wooden floors - great for keeping clean but they appear to act like a drum skin!

My housemate cares about his look - he dresses well all the time which is actually a bit of an inspiration. Jeans, nice shirts, nice jackets. He styles his hair, trendy glasses - its a good look!

But the boots! 

He wears boots. RM Williams boots. ALL THE TIME. As soon as he wakes he gets dressed in the whole outfit - boots and all, and stays thus until bed. The boots are very loud on our floors - you all know what it sounds like. I've been woken by him just walking around on multiple (easily dozens of) occasions.

On a normal work day I get it. But every single day? Even days where we don't leave the house? (we're on lockdown so that's every day). Even when he stays up chatting to mates and decides to have toast at 2am? Or gets up early on a Sunday and clip clops around cooking breakfast and making coffee?

AITA for asking that he wear quieter shoes late at night/early morning/if he is not leaving the house at all?

N.b. I have already asked something very similar to ""I know this may sound petty but would you mind swapping your shoes when were home? They are so loud"". His response was ""No. I am wearing my boots. I always wear my boots"""	1	4	0.67

Im really torn right now so... internet

I am a nanny for a small and local agency. Their clients are mainly doctors/lawyers/CEOs etc. I take care of a 15 year old boy (he doesn't need a sitter just someone to make sure he is held accountable for his chores, meds, school, and other things) and I normally chill with him and read NatGeo, read books, or watch Netflix. But I make sure he is happy, fed, and entertained.

This afternoon I had to drop him off to swim practice and he wasn't allowed inside yet so I stayed in my car for about 5 minutes watching him to make sure he is safe and gets to his practice. The problem was that he didn't want me to but I told him I will watch him until he goes through the doors. I was not about to abandon him with people I don't know and go home.

After a few minutes I got a call from the dad saying why I didn't follow his sons request. I told him his son is my responsibility when I am working and that I do not feel comfortable simply leaving him. I told him safety is my priority but the dad didn't want to listen. He said he wasn't going to pay my final 5 minutes and he was going to complain to the agency.

I told my mother about this and she just sighed and said that he knows his son best and to just listen. My father said the same thing. Then I asked my sister and she said I should have left and not put effort into a shitty job. I love my job so much because it saved me from Starbucks and I do everything to go above and beyond for my clients. But I felt this was basic responsibility

Aita?

TL:DR; stayed 5 minutes to make sure client's son got to swim practice safely. Everyone's saying i shouldn't have bit I felt it was the right thing"	4	28	0.61

Yesterday I(22f) saw a tweet which said ‘if I let u suck my nipples, I expect a mother’s day gift.’ I found it funny and showed it to my bf(22m). My bf found this amusing too and laughed loudly and said yeah sure don’t worry. 

We were with our friends, and they were curious as to what was so funny. So I read them the tweet. Everyone found this funny except my friend, Jane(23f). Jane had a miscarriage 2 months ago and was offended by the tweet. She went on a rant on how disrespectful was this to her because she lost her child. 

I understand her pain, and I was there to support her during that time, but it wasn’t my intention to hurt her. I genuinely found it funny and shared it with my friends.

My sister (I’ll call her Nina) is a college student, but my dad is paying her rent and she has money from a personal injury lawsuit (she had minor scrapes and bruises). My mom used to be a lawyer and did a lot of legal work to get her that money. I know she has spent $12,000 of it on stuff like expensive purses and other stuff for her, but she still has a lot left. She also just got a job. Last Christmas, before she got her money from the lawsuit, she asked my mom and I to buy airfare tickets for her friend to join her for the holidays and said she’d pay us back. I knew her friend was going through a rough time so mom and I each paid $400 for it and didn’t push Nina to pay us back. (Nor did I say that she didn’t have to pay me back...I just let it drop.)  
Last night was my mom and sister Maria’s birthday, and we took them out to eat at PF Chang’s. The bill was $136 for 6 people. My brother’s girlfriend (bro is in the military now) and I jumped at the check, not wanting my mom to have to pay for her own birthday dinner. I said “Bro's gf and I got it. Nina’s pitching in too, right Nina?” Nina said, “Uhh...” I assumed she was joking and the party went on. I paid, bro's gf venmo'd me, and we all went our separate ways.  
Later that night, I texted Nina. Word for word:  
“No pressure but if you wanna pitch in for dinner your third is $45 and my Venmo is x”  
Nina: “If you didn't want to pay the whole check maybe then don't offer. Don’t rely on other people for the choices you make.”  
Me: “I just said if you wanted to and no pressure lol. I know you’re a poor college student tho so don’t worry about it.” I was ready to let it drop at this point.

Then she says: “I already said no.”

I replied, ""In that case you can just pay me the $400 I spent for your friend's flight."" 

Nina venmo'd me $415 with the comment ""Flight and my dinner"". I found out the next day that she had called both my mom and Maria crying last night that I made her pay $400 because she wouldn't pitch in for dinner. I didn't tell them about the whole debacle because it was their birthday and I wanted them to just have a good time and not worry about the check. Maria thinks I'm TA, mom thinks Nina is. New info I learned this morning: Nina thought Mom was paying for the flights and that she didn't ever have to pay us back. AITA?

The bus driver called me last week and asked for a copy of the schedule. I sent it on and thought nothing of it.

I didn't reach out to the driver, but since I had the info handy when he called, it just seemed sensible and efficient to forward it on to him instead of saying ""sorry you'll have to ask the kids father, I'm not allowed to speak to you.""

Well everyone, a lot has happened in the last few weeks. Nicole's cousin and fiance have announced their wedding date...two weeks after ours. 

It came down to a comment I made in front of Nicole's twin sister (Brittany). Amber had announced their engagement, and said that they were getting married in October, but no specific date. The three of us were chatting about things when Brittany brought up the announcement and mentioned how it seemed they were trying to steal the spotlight again, and I muttered about them even stealing the wedding day. Nicole had said she talked to Brittany about it, and she had, but didn't tell her they were doing it on the same day.

Brittany lost her mind about it. She three-way called Amber and Amber's mom and read them the riot act. It was both glorious, and extremely uncomfortable to listen to. There's a lot of...stuff...between those parts of the families. Brittany told them they had a week to figure out when in October they were getting married other than our wedding day, or she would tell everyone in the family what they were trying to do.

Amber's mom tried to downplay it all, but Brittany wasn't having any of it. Even though she's about 5 minutes older than Nicole, she was acting like she was a much older protective sister. It was a long phone call, but in the end they figured the jig was up. A few days later they announced the date, but since Amber's fiance lost his job, and their families can't afford a traditional wedding, they're only inviting a small portion of their original guest list, and having a zoom wedding.

Luckily, we don't get back from our honeymoon until the day after their wedding. Shucks!"	24792	417	0.98

My dad married Jane when I (18f) was 14 and my stepsister, Lucy (18f), was 15. Lucy and I were born only a couple months apart, but she was born after the school age cutoff, so she's been in my grade. We got along great when we were younger. We'd talked about going to college together, being roommates, etc.

When J&amp;L moved in with us, Lucy moved into a much more competitive school district. We both went to a magnet school, and Lucy took a while to adjust to the different teaching style and school culture. I was always helping her out because our parents pushed me to because ""she was my sister."" We both dreamed of going to C University, a highly competitive private university.

Background: I'm a swimmer. I was #1 in the district, #15 in the state, and hold a few national titles in my swimming events. I was 12/280 in my graduating class and had &gt;100 volunteering hours in HS, and I did really well on my SAT (1550+). Lucy wasn't a bad student, but was only doing well because I was helping her. She was in academic honor societies, had \~75 volunteering hours, and scored 1470-1500 on her SAT. We were both very competitive applicants to CU.

In senior year, I signed to swim at CU, and my family was really happy for me. Lucy applied to CU but got waitlisted and then rejected. Then, her tune changed. She went around telling everyone that the only reason I got into CU was because I was a good swimmer whenever anyone spoke about college and on social media. I tried to just let it go because she was sad, but once I heard her telling her friends that I was a ""dumb bitch who wouldn't have made it without swim."" I lost it because in the Ivy League, even to swim there you have to be smart, and she was discounting my academic merit.

Here is why I think I'm TA: I essentially told her (in front of her friends) that the only reason she was doing well in school was because I was helping her, and that I should've just let her suffer on her own. I also said that it's not my fault that she was too stupid to get in on her own. My parents heard and were very angry with me for ""bullying my sister.""

I admit, I was being a bit bitchy, but I just got really mad abt the things she was saying about me. Lucy is going to another really good school (one of the best in the US for her major), but still hasn't apologized and has been quite standoffish, and idk what to do because she's my sister and I still want to have a relationship with her.

AITA+help on what to do?

Edit: for people telling me to be the bigger person and apologize, I've already tried multiple times. I've tried to talk face to face, call her, text her, write her a letter, and make her a gift basket, but she keeps rejecting/ignoring my apology. I know I hurt her, and I'm sorry, but idk how to show her that and let her know that what she kept saying was hurtful."	1687	168	0.96

OK so he then wanted to shut down the conversation - and I pointed out -  'well you know i tend to look at other perspectives, so this will always happen, and if you do the wrong thing i'm not going to be 'on your side' about it'. by which time he is yelling at me for being an arsehole and not letting it go and shutting up when he had enough.

Whenever one of us fell sick and couldn't go to school, the healthy one would send him everything done in school in that time. We've managed it that way for years.

However thus summer, this was different. We just returned to school after quarantine and had hybrid learning. Meaning our class was split in half and one group had presence lessons for one week while the other had home schooling. 

On the first week of presence lessons, I got sick with an upset stomach. I missed three days because of it. Since this ""friend"" was the only one I trusted in my group, I asked him immediately after I returned from the doctor if he could send me everything they do in this three days, to which he agreed.

The three days were over and I asked for the stuff. At first, I only got some worksheets from the English lessons. For the stuff of the German lessons, I had to ask specifically since we had to do a test on the next day and I was missing something. But for 2 subjects, I got nothing. He just said that we hadn't done anything important, so I didn't ask further.

But on the next lessons of this two subjects, I didn't understand anything. They had begun a completely new topic and I missed the start. He asked me for help there, but obviously I didn't know either.

Turns out, he had slept on this lessons and didn't tell me. We had to send an assignment away on that day, so he probably worked into the night and didn't get enough sleep like I did. We had a test on the next week on one of this lessons and I have to write an exam on the other one next year, so I needed this stuff.

I ended up asking my teacher to give me the missing stuff and luckily got it, but I'm kinda angry at him. I would have been okay if he told me that he was too exhausted on that day and that I needed to get this stuff elsewhere. But he did nothing, he not even apologized.

So three days ago, he got sick. He will probably ask me for the stuff, but I'm thinking of not helping him this time. He clearly doesn't care about me, even though I've helped him so many times in school (by tutoring, doing more stuff on group assignments and of course the stuff).

My brother (14m) has always been quite feminine. He's always wanted to be a hair dresser, liked playing with make up and spent a lot of his younger years playing with dolls - especially since his mum (same dad, different mums) walked out on him when he was 5. We're not the type of family where ""dolls and makeup are for girls, trucks and cars are for boys"", we've always encouraged each other to pursue our individual interests.

We live in a white area, which means him being mixed raced has meant he's faced a few issues with other kids - especially with current events and being on the receiving end of some racist comments. Since coming out as gay last year, he's also had the occasional mean comment from some people in school and I've been working with my dad/the school to put an end to all of that.

When he started high school, he got a new group of friends, stopped playing with dolls and started getting into stuff that was typical for kids his age. But when his friend from next door (12f) started the same school last September, he began only hanging around with her and stopped being interested in anything except dolls. He doesn't go out anymore (pre-pandemic), just sits in his room playing with his dolls. When he does, it's only to go round next door and swap/play dolls with her.

Our dad works a lot (single dad of 4) so I've been spending time at the weekend with him and my other brother (11m). I've tried gently to get him into new things, to come out and try a new activity with me and our other brother and even tried encouraging him to get involved in things he's shown an interest in, but then he changes his mind and refuses - sticking with the dolls. He even stopped doing school work during isolation because he was playing with his dolls, which resulted in him getting in trouble. I'm worried that him playing with the dolls will just encourage more bullying and the fact he's isolating himself from all his friends is really starting to worry me.

I've tried being gentle with this, but I feel me and my dad have no other option than to tell him he's too old to be playing with dolls. I feel so guilty for it and I know it will upset him, but is there any other way? WIBTA if I told my brother he's too old to be playing with dolls?

**Edit:** Not much of an update but I want to say thank you for the advice. Most of you were really helpful, others were just plain hurtful with their accusations. I absolutely love my brother to bits and just want him to be happy.

So I asked him if he was ok and honestly asked him why he had gotten back into the dolls. It turns out that he never stopped liking them. When he started secondary school, our dad made him throw away all his dolls, including the huge house I bought them and the ones his mum got him - he says he not bothered about those ones, but it's obvious he is. He also told me that he was feeling brave and decided to message his mum and tell her how her actions had made him feel (I won't say everything she did). She got angry with him, called him a disappointment and blocked him.

So, we talked about that and I reassured him that while his mum sucks, he's always got me. From that convo, it seems like the dolls are a comfort thing that reminds him of his parents. His mum doesn't care and our dad works nights and weekends so he barely sees or spends time with him. I'm not going to tell him to stop playing with them as it's clear he needs them to cope with home life right now. He's also promised me that he'll try harder to keep up with school work as our dad came down really hard on him for that too. I did ask if he needed to speak to someone about this, like a councillor, and he said no, he's happy doing his own thing and for now I respect that. But I said to him if it keeps affecting him he needs to tell me so we can work through his feelings.

On a more positive note, he's also started costume design for his dolls during his lockdown, which are huge improvement on the ones they came with. He wants to do hairdressing when he grows up, as I feel like its what he thinks will please our dad, but he's really getting into clothes making lately as he's made nearly 100 custom pieces for his dolls!  So, we're going out this weekend to buy material for his dolls so he can make their outfits and get some practise for his textiles GCSE - which he starts this year."	93	63	0.85

My gift request for a recent anniversary was a pair of mid-priced over-ear headphones. To my surprise, I unboxed a fancy, pricey pair. My partner explained cost didn't matter because he intended to share them. I was a little confused, but overall nbd.


This has been fine... with one exception: My partner wears these in the gym. I've politely said that I wish he wouldn't due to potential damage or misplacing them. I have also offered a decent in-ear alternative for him to use. However, I always gave in after he puppydog-eyed me.


It turns out his parents will be gifting him a pair of the same or nicer headphones for his bday. I'll hold onto these headphones then.


I feel the entire thing was kinda weirdly self-centered. He obligates me to share something, refuses my requests to not wear them while lifting, and then I can have them once he decides he has another option. From a practical side, I am stuck with a pair I perceive to be at-risk for hidden damage or a quicker lifespan - my original intention was to keep headphones in basically mint condition.

AITA for being annoyed and feeling the way I do? He probably thinks more like ""sharing is caring, I would do this for you""."	40	21	0.9

Last weekend I, my twin sister Nicky and 4 other friends of ours (3F 3M, age 16-17) went to an amusement park. When we reached there it was more crowded than expected despite the pandemic, so we decided to upgrade our tickets to VIP. With the upgrade we were given VIP wristbands to enter a separate queue from the normal, longer queue for the rides and attractions.

One of our friends, Jake, was unwilling to spend extra money on the VIP upgrade. He said that he had no extra money and would just join the normal queue or skip the attractions instead if the queue was too long. Nicky, who has a crush on Jake, offered him her wristband after suggested by Jake’s friend. The agreement was to share the wristband and take turns to join the VIP queue with the others. I was against this idea but Nicky insisted that it was her choice. 

Jake did not return the wristband nor bothered with taking turns, and Nicky did not ask it back. I wanted to ask it back for her because I felt that he was just taking advantage of her, wanting to enjoy the VIP benefits without paying for it. However, whenever I tried to protest, Nicky would just pull me to a side and demand that I shut up because it would have made her look bad in front of Jake. 

Later on Nicky asked me to lend her my wristband so that she could have a few turns to ride with us as she was feeling left out. By that time, I was rather fed up with her too, so I told her that if she wanted to join us she would have to ask for her wristband, the one she paid in full, back from Jake. I paid for my VIP wristband, so why should I lend it to her when she was too spineless to get her own back and refused my help?

Nicky was rather miserable by the end of the day because she did not get to hang out with Jake, even though later on we split up with the boys and only then did Jake returned the wristband to her. She has been angry at me since then and even my mother said that I should at least share my wristband with her when she was being nice to share it with a friend who could not afford it.

I don't exactly see what I did wrong considered that I did wanted to help her to get her wristband back but she did not want me to, so I respected her wishes. Shouldn't it be normal to not want to share something I paid for when she could get the exact thing back if only she wanted to?"	17	21	0.87

anyways, I was driving my partner and his brother to pick up weed

the whole ride there, and the ride back up until i asked to play one song, their music was playing, and i was fine with it, and i figured maybe i could take a risk as the driver and ask

my partner got frustrated, asked me 3 times for the name of the song, said he couldnt find it, and said he was just annoyed cause it used his data, and then when i said he could use my phone and play it off spotify, he got annoyed by the password even though he knows its his name

eventually the song plays, and he puts his seat all the way back to talk to his brother while im listening and trying to enjoy my song

over halfway through the song, he was still doing this, so i said he could play what he wanted to

once we were home for a bit, he kept bringing it up over and over

then we both left upset and he said over text that hes sick of the attitudes i give him and all the drama and fighting, so i apologized and said its not gonna happen again, because we do have mutual likes when it comes to music, and he still hasnt responded or came home.

am i the asshole? in hindsight i think i might be because he was trying to subtly tell me he didnt like my music, but i didnt get it"	11	31	0.92

Over the years I developed a bit of anxiety about playing it. I was allowed to play whenever I wanted, but there was always a lingering fear that I was being a nuisance to everyone around by doing so. Having that thought in my mind while still growing up and trying to understand social cues made me stressed out and abandon the instrument.

Salvation came to me when planning a gift for my friend’s birthday. They loved violins so I figured, why not give them mine? I asked a hypothetical question a while before their birthday and they said that both they and their guardians were on board with the idea.

I still want to play the violin, of course, and I discovered, in my present hunting research, that silent violins existed and I was sold. I planned on buying one with the money I earned doing my side-job, so there’d be a bit more satisfaction in having earned it.

When I brought the idea up to my parents they were initially supportive of me wanting to send a present, but then as I told them I was going to send my violin, my mother wouldn’t have it.

Mom: Do you know how much that thing cost? 

Me: Yes, but I physically can’t play so what is the problem?

Mom: Don’t go sending something so expensive to just anybody. (note that my friend and I have been friends for 4 years)

Me: What would I use it for when I can’t even play it?

She can’t seem to come to terms with the fact that I suffer from clinical depression on a normal basis, so it didn’t surprise me when she refused to understand why I had to send it to alleviate the burden from my shoulders.

My violin instructor also had a word with me and said a good quality violin would usually be $500 and above, but I estimated this one to be a little over $100, which is still a lot of money, but not as much as she’s blowing it out of proportion to be.

She wouldn’t budge, and even got my sister on her side to gang up on me.

I haven’t sent it yet, and plan on doing so soon, but I needed to get this off my chest.

TL;DR Would I be the asshole if I sent an old violin my mother bought for me, that I can no longer play due to my mental health, as a birthday present to a close friend behind her back?"	6	16	0.81

At the beginning of October, she invited me to a Halloween party on October 31st at her &amp; her boyfriend's place. She really wanted me to be there especially since back in 2016, I ended our friendship and we never once celebrated Halloween nor her birthday in November together. This year, I oblige and say that I will be there. Weeks go by and she doesn't bring up the party. I receive no text or email for details so I assume she is either no longer having it or that the party is still scheduled as planned. Throughout the month, I rearranged everything around the party and even picked out a costume which isn't typical for me because I NEVER CELEBRATE HALLOWEEN! 

Last night (October 29th) she texts and we talk about everything besides the party and just as I'm about to ask how the party planning is going, she says ""did you figure out your costume for tomorrow night?"". I'm a bit thrown by this because I was under the impression that it was on Halloween day. So I ask if she means tomorrow (friday) or (saturday) halloween? She says Friday at 8:30 pm which is in less than 24 hours. After talking some more, apparently, they changed the date of the party up to Friday because of her boyfriend's work schedule and she did not inform me AT ALL. 

She apologized and told me I didn't have to rearrange my weekend for it but I already rearranged my whole month for it and bought a costume that I wouldn't have otherwise because again I DON'T CELEBRATE HALLOWEEN! Here's the kicker, I was actually excited to see her and dress up this year but I would have to rush and move everything around to be there. I would have to spend over $100 on lyft there and back because I gave my friend my car to get to work because I work from home. I have no other party to go to because hello covid and I'm thinking about canceling and just sitting at home in my costume for the next two days with a bottle of wine to drown out my wasted money and time. 

She said even if I literally only stopped by to say hi and bye, she will still be grateful and would make me some food to go for the drive. AITA for canceling and not bending over backward to be there, because I sure feel like it."	3	13	0.72

He's a pretty hygienic guy in general - he showers everyday, uses deodorants and aftershaves, cleans up after himself, washes his clothes regularly.... But he doesn't brush his teeth. 

I didn't notice this for the first year that we didn't live together, I don't know how his breath didn't stink but it just didn't. When we moved in together, I noticed that while I was brushing twice a day - he didn't even bring his toothbrush from his mother's house. I bought him one as kind of a hint, but I noticed he very rarely used it. 

For the first year or so that we were living together, I still didn't feel that comfortable or that it was my place to say anything - we were still getting used to living together and I didn't want to embarrass him or be pushy. However, his breath has really starting stinking and his teeth are looking more and more yellow. More than anything, I'm concerned they're going to rot/fall out! 

He also openly admits he doesn't brush his teeth, which is strange. So I've been hinting over the past couple of months in what I thought was a subtle way, like when he's in the shower I'll go in the bathroom to brush my teeth and ask him if he wants his, or just casually saying 'Don't forget to brush' when he's getting ready. To be honest, he does do it when I say something - so I guess I've been doing it more and more. 

Today however, he snapped at me. He said I'm treating him like he's my son and I don't need to be constantly telling him to brush his teeth. I genuinely have only been doing it nicely and in his best interests, but I feel bad that I may have embarrassed him. I also don't really know what to do now because he's probably going to stop brushing again altogether. AITA?"	28	21	0.87

Also this happened in 2019 September. I currently live in Canada.

Little backstory: My parents (65 both) have two kids,me(39M) and my brother (19M). My brother was a pre menopause miracle and I was at med school,in a different city when he got to the world so he was raised like a single kid and my parents were really orbiting around him(they still are actually). My brother have started to cry about everything at age 3,if a street vendor screamed,he would cry, if loud music played,he would cry. This was not normal and they got to my town,I called my professor in pediatrics and after his evaluation,he directly referred him to an ENT and also a child and adolescent psychiatrist for evaluation.

He was clean for ENT but you can see the result,he was diagnosed with ASD. Therapies started early but his auditory hypersensitivity did not get better but in the other aspects,he did really well so he was assigned private tutors and if he is in public,he can only go out with earmuffs or noice cancelling headphones. 

I have got married to my long time girlfriend because I was offered a fellowship in Canada and it would be more easier for us to move in the same time if we were married(we are together for 15 years). Since we decided to get married,we said ""Let's give a rager!"" and we planned a wedding party with drinks,a rock band and also some good old strippers(we wanted some drama to be honest at the party) after the ceremony.

I did not invite my brother to the party and I explained my reasonings way before hand for him not to get jealous. He understood and was delighted about the fact he was not invited. 

Well,neither my parents took this news well,nor my-in laws.All of our cousins and our similar age group is invited to the party and they said my brother would be more excluded from them(he does not like big family gatherings and they usually had to hire a nanny or leave him to me for longer trips.) and would look like a total creep. This is true unfortunately,my brother rarely knows any people and has only a handful of friends. Most of his friends are online and even in university,he would take the lessons online(university allowed it) if it did not need a lab work(he is studying computer engineering) and always chose jobs WFH(mostly data entry stuff) in his high school or jobs had really.low human interactions(he was a wildlife guard one summer and it was him and another dude only in a cabin,for a month,in the wilderness without any settlements in 15 km). I could have easily arranged a calm dinner with few people's and then move on to the rager but it was our night,we wanted to rage and get stupid drunk and wake up in a hangover with some comedic drama. Luckily they did not pushed us in that time but they bring this topic every time we.do Zoom or Skype with them. My brother is really happy that he saw our ceremony.

So,AITA dear folks?"	3	22	0.72

I can hear everything my upstairs neighbor does. Ex: turning on their kitchen sink (loud pipes + thin walls). They also happen to just be really noisy. Almost every night, at least 5 nights a week, it sounds like elephants are bowling. At times I think they must have fallen over from how loud the crashes are. They also keep their TV volume loud. To the point that I can tell what they’re watching because I can hear the theme song and dialogue. Our complex has quiet hours that start at 10 PM. Although this has been a daily struggle for the past 6 months, I’ve only knocked on their door to ask them to quiet down twice. Both times were well after 10:30 PM, and the noise was excessive enough to where I couldn’t study or fall asleep. The rest of the times I’ve just sucked it up, because I know the ceilings are thin if I can hear them turn their faucet on. I don’t want to be TA by constantly telling them to be quiet, especially when it’s not during quiet hours.

Recently, I can tell they’ve been smoking inside. That’s fine, I really don’t care. However, I can hear them coughing to the point of gagging everyday. It’s disgusting, and I don’t want to have to listen to that in my home. Tonight, I woke up to the fire alarm sounding once, then abruptly stopping... at 4:20 AM *eyeroll.* I then proceeded to lay in bed and listen to them hacking and gagging. Yes smoking *cough cough* is illegal where I live, but I believe people should be able to do what they want in their homes as long as they’re not harming anyone. I want to report them to the apartment complex for 1) being excessively noisy in general and 2) setting off the smoke alarm in the middle of the night from doing something against the lease. If they were cooking or whatever, I’d be annoyed, but shit happens and I’d let it go.

I’m concerned about being the AH, because smoking illicit substances is against the lease, and they’re very quick to give people notices of eviction. Being too loud is also against the lease, but it’s not an eviction worthy offense. I don’t want to report them for setting off the alarm in the middle of the night if it means they’ll get evicted, but I’m a medical student. I’m exhausted. I also struggle with depression and anxiety that gives me insomnia. I’m so angry that they woke me up. I’m so freaking tired, but I can’t go back to sleep.
So WIBTA for reporting them for setting off the alarm in the middle of the night, knowing it could potentially get them evicted?"	7	10	1.0

Our views on social media have never been hidden. We asked our family not to post online about our engagement, we have minimal pictures of our wedding etc.

When we told our families we were expecting we explicitly said no social media. We were extremely clear.

Fast forward to one week after I gave birth to our child. I found out through a family friend that my MIL had made a FB group and had posted photos/updates about our child. I was livid. 

My husband and I asked her about it to which she said we told her she could. I expressed that I was very upset that she went behind our backs to do this.

She then asked my husband to come over ti her house without myself or our child and listed all the things she was upset with me over.

i’m home from school, and had finals all week. for the first few days home, i did the dishes, did some laundry, shoveled the deck, cleaned up every night. after the first few nights after dinner i said “(brothers name), it’s your turn for the dishes tonight” and my mom would look at me and gesture to “cut it out” and to drop it. 
i let it go the first night, but last night i said it again and she told me to drop it, this time a little more intense. i stopped in the middle of cleaning the stove and went into the other room. 
my mom asked me why i wasn’t helping, and i said “if you don’t make him help when everyone else is helping, clearly you have it under control. why does he get special treatment?” and she flipped out. i still help with laundry and clean up my own messes, but i refuse to do the dishes after dinner because of how she caters to my brother. sure he’s busy with school, but i have exams and i still find time to help. 
i know what im doing is petty and childish, but it’s infuriating that everyone is expected to help but him. we walk on eggshells to pander to his mood swings, and he gets whatever he wants. im tired of the double standard. i was expected to help at his age, and it’s ridiculous he doesn’t. am i the asshole?

edit: i think he is depressed. i’m gonna try and cut him some slack, it’s how i wish i was treated when i was depressed at his age too. thank you."	986	100	0.97

It is a holiday tradition in his family of origin to wrap Christmas gifts on Christmas Eve. Last night I spent 2 hours driving to get him a gift he really wants (not going to say what it is in case he sees this post), 4 hrs taking apart, cleaning out, and rebuilding a Wii for him, and another 1.5 hours cleaning out another surprise device. After that, I was feeling the holiday spirit, so i started wrapping his gifts. After I finished his, I decided to wrap my parents gifts as well, since I was having fun. 

He is very upset with me about this. He thinks that I ruined Christmas because I wrapped gifts without him. I told him I would be okay with redoing all the gifts together, except for a collection of books and a teddy bear for my mom (which I intended to be from me, and are sentimental) and a signed picture I gave each of them, which are secured in cardboard and ribbon to make sure the photos aren’t bent, which would be a pain to redo. He told me he wanted some space and to let him know when I woke up (I have been up most of the night working on cleaning the presents I got him). 

Am I the asshole for wrapping these gifts without him? I tried to compromise and re wrap most of them (there are only 5-6 for each of my parents). I didn’t mean to upset him and we have more gifts to wrap today together. I was just having fun wrapping presents."	18	17	0.91

Icy Reception	https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/kny2f3/aita_icy_reception/	"So I ride a motorbike, and have done for many years. This morning I was attempting to ride to McDonalds (because breakfast ❤) but it was super icy.

I figured that the roads would be fine as they would have been gritted, so just drove slowly to the main-ish road and soon found out that my assumption wasn't correct. Even this road was the proverbial ice rink. I continued my journey slowly (around 5mph) and it was okay for about 500m and the first thing I noticed was a cyclist who had been on the curb standing up and beginning to wheel his bike. Then I hit the black ice that had been his downfall and I hit the deck. A couple of people came to help me (people are generally nice to bikers who come off) and during the time it took me to decide to abandon my breakfast plans I saw a delivery van coming up the hill and when it got to the top it also hit the same black ice and smashed into the back of a parked car.

I decided to try to ride home slowly as I was only a couple of blocks away. I put both feet on the ground to stabilise myself and slowly made my way back towards my house.

On the way back I noticed another cyclist (this one in the road) and she was absolutely speeding her way towards the black ice that had already taken 3 of us out. When she came alongside me I waved my hand in the universal sign to slow down (as I knew that as soon as she hit the same ice that had taken me out she would come off, and possibly even collide with the crashed van that was still parked up with hazard lights flashing) or even hit the hill at speed (this hill leads down to a major road) and not be able to stop and go into oncoming traffic.

Anyway. She saw my hand signals and must not have comprehended what I meant and put her brakes on sharply and she ended up falling off and hitting the floor.

She was shouting after me and asking me what I wanted. Screaming that she had been fine and when I told her about the black ice she just said something like ""right""

It wasn't safe for me to stop. I would have come off as well again if I had attempted, plus a passer by was helping her, and all the while she was screaming at me that she had been fine going along as she had been (she was doing around 10mph)

I haven't been able to stop thinking about it ever since and feel pretty terrible

She takes things very personally and is easily angered, and after 18 years I realized I don’t have to cower in the corner and let her berate me when she’s having a bad day. 
Yesterday, my mom came to me and told me I needed to clean my room and she would help me if I needed it. I told her I’d clean it myself and that was that. I got to work but shortly after she came in from shoveling snow (we had a snowstorm) and passive-aggressively told my little brother (11) that she had two young kids who should be doing this instead of her. That bothered me, since she could’ve asked me to stop what I was doing and I would’ve helped shovel. The day continued to escalate as she made digs at me and my brother as we cleaned our rooms. I don’t like anyone in my room (I have a lot of personal stuff and my mother used to snoop through my things so I don’t trust her), but she came in anyway and started putting away the laundry I was already putting away. I got testy with her, told her I didn’t need help, and she just said (sarcastically) she knows she’s a bad mom. Then she left and she hasn’t talked to me since. She’s been slamming doors all day and ignoring me as I enter a room. 
So, AITA? Should I just suck it up and apologize? We’ve had fights that lasted in her giving me the silent treatment for days and I can’t stand doing that again since we’re in lockdown.
// UPDATE: (sorry if the formatting is weird, i’m on mobile) i apologized to my mom - it was uncomfortable but she ended up apologizing too. things are tense in my home but i do love my family so if i have to suck up my pride once in a while to apologize, i will. it just makes lockdown easier. thanks for the NTAs, i didn’t expect as many as i got. the ESHs are totally valid, too."	15	18	0.89

She will leave without  doing dishes after dinner and the one chore she does have is putting away dishes after they are dry which she either doesn't do or asks me to help her while she is slowly doing it while watching youtube and leaves me to do all the heavy lifting. I don't really have a bone to pick with her at all since she is just a teenager and still learning.

I DO however don't understand when I tell my mom to leave it for her today she blows up at me and tells me to get out of her face. I worked 12 hours today, watched both my baby siblings on and off every moment I could, vacuumed and deep cleaned the kitchen, washed the dog and turtle tank (Which is both again my sister's responsibility but I get that things happen and she's got school and work) and I did everyone's laundry. So today I thought, my sister hasn't touched a dish in a week it should be fine that I leave it to her. But no my mom yells at me and I just stare at my sister who is watching tv and wondering why its on me to do everything.

This has happened before too where on my birthday I did dishes and cleaned while everyone slept and the next day instead of doing dishes i went up stairs to finish laundry because I thought since I didn't get a break on my birthday at least my sister could do dishes but no. I get screamed at for leaving it for someone else. I don't know what to say as my mom takes anything said back to her as attitude. I don't give attitude and generally am the happier or cheerful one of the family but I get extremely frustrated when small things like this makes her blow up while my sister doesn't try and fails classes and no one bats an eye. Again I don't blame her because she is a teenager but it just makes me feel so much more weight on me.

I think I shouldn't have told my mom what to do since I am living in her house. I don't know if I could have handled the situation better. "	18	17	0.91

I (29F) had a group of girlfriends. We were very close to each other and before COVID we used to hang out almost every week. 
When I got married last year they all were my bridesmaids. In my country isn't very common to have them but they all wanted to be so we were in a happy place. I never asked them to look certain way or buy expensive things (or anything at all). It was all good (I thought). When COVID started I have to say I entered in survival mood: locked myself down and not visiting anyone, including family. They all wanted to meet but I refused several times. Turns out one of my friends was pregnant and they wanted to meet at the baby shower. I didn't attend and I thought no one would because we were in the highest risk and she was pregnant. I politely zoom called the mom-to-be and she was fine. We even picked the name of the baby together. (Gosh I was the first one to meet the baby via Zoom the night she was born!! ) 
They attended the baby shower and I recognized I lashed at them for being so careless... From then I feel all spiraled down. I talked to them individually and I apologized if I had done something wrong and asked them several times to please tell me if I had done something wrong and how to fix it..they all said it was all ok. But suddenly I find out they left our group chat and blocked me in social media. They keep hanging out without me now. 
I felt I was a good friend.  I was there for funerals and birthdays. The good and the bad. It breaks my heart not knowing what I did wrong. 
Please be blunt!!

The reason why I might be the asshole here is because I could be really harsh on people. If someone ask for my opinion I'll give it. I won't judge but I won't budge either and my friends could see it as just being hard.

I was my parents ONLY child they had but my mother had been married previously &amp; had two kids(F&amp;M) makes them my half siblings but they have no tie to my father. I have never been close to my mother, sister or brother my father got full custody of me during the divorce but that is a whole other story another time. Bottom line my father doesn't like her nor does she like him (her kids really don't like him).

So on with the story.

My sister is expecting &amp; is due sometime this yr, I am not close to her you can guess I have little to do w/ anything. Today I received a text from my mother asking me an odd question asking if My Father &amp; I are still members to a club I've been there many times growing up so many of the older staff know me &amp; the newer staff know me through my father, however I am not a member; my father is.

So her question, she just calls or texts me when she wants something. I'll get random calls from her begging me to take care of her dog because she's at some sort of outing &amp; can't get the dog inside &amp; fed. Or I'm asked to come over &amp; do XYZ. The list goes on &amp; on, more or less she only contacts me when I can do something for her never to say hi, or ask how I'm doing &amp; this has been going on basically my whole life.

The question she was asking was in concern of my sister, she wanted to use my fathers account for my sisters baby shower. I just sat there looking at my phone re-reading the text before responding w/ I do not know let me check with my dad. A bit of time goes on &amp; I get off the phone w/ my father &amp; I text her back saying. 'I am not technically a member of club I can only go there because the staff &amp; other members know I am my dads kid but I don't abuse it.'

Not even a minute passes after I send that &amp; she response back saying my sister knows XYZ &amp; was using their membership &amp; that my sisters step mom (very sweet women she's my hair dresser), was using some one else's membership. I was floored, if they had those people to help them or gave them access why did she need my fathers account? Turns out to hold a baby shower or an event like that its free to members, so once again its a text/call of you can do something for me!

I didn't out right tell her no but I did tell her 'If you want to use the club you can either talk to the people you just told me of or call my father directly'. I haven't gotten a response back, but I'm really upset by this...as I said its not the first time she's asked something like this."	29	27	0.85

We are both young workers who just started their careers, neither of us earn much at all. Her parents are quite wealthy and have bought her a house outright. Due to covid, we decided to move in together 4 months into our relationship to make sure we can still see each other.

Now the lockdown end is insight, her parents started discussing how much rent I should pay them when the lockdown ends. They are being considerate with the price of it, as they are asking only 250-300 a month, when houses around us go for 500-600.

However, I think rent is a huge waste of money into the void and my whole life I was planning to save up enough for a mortgage whilst living with my parents. My parents only charge me 200 for mortgage we have going and that's pretty much it which gives me an opportunity to save up. I don't pay any other bills there.

Here, I pay for half the shopping, half the bills, sometimes I buy stuff for the house as well to contribute toward it. Making me pay rent on top of it will just set me back in life more, I want to put that money towards my future, which I can do if I move back.

I would rather move back to live with my parents, but I think that will hinder my relationship a lot. If I don't live here, my girlfriend won't get a tenant and will just live alone and it just ends up being inconvenient for us and they still won't get their rent.

Am I the asshole here for not wanting to pay rent?

Edit: Some common questions/more info;

1. She doesn't pay rent.
2. I do pay half of every cost in the house, including bills, tax, purchases of new appliances and maintinance of the house.
3. Parents do NOT contribute any costs towards the house and haven't for 4 years.
4. House was purchased for her, but it's still in her dad's name."	85	159	0.77

I (30m) am coming to Reddit because I honestly need help to see if what I'm doing very wrong and need a stranger's perspective of the situation in order to get validation or advice. I have two sisters (32f and 28f) and our parents (57m and 56f) have been divorced for 5 years. My dad divorced mom because he found out that during their engagement she slept with another man. My mom swears that while she cheated before they were married, that she's been faithful during the marriage and that it was a long time ago. To my dad, however, this was all new information and he felt as if his right to choose was taken away and that he no longer trusted my mom.

While I love my mom I understood why my dad was divorcing her and didn't hesitate when he asked for a DNA test. My sisters' were hurt that he would ask and initially refused until they found out that I was doing it. They tried to pressure me to change my mind but I was completely on my dad's side and also wanted to know myself for health reasons. When all three tests came back that we were all his bio children my mom and sisters tried to use this as a way to convince dad to stay reiterating that it was a long time ago. They even resulted to trying to emotionally manipulate my dad, which he took pretty badly and cut contact with my sisters until the divorce was finalized. My uncle, his best friend, and I were the only ones completely on his side during the divorce and because of that my relationship got a lot stronger.

Eventually, my dad and sisters were able to re-establish some type of relationship but there was this difference that you could feel. My dad stopped sharing deeply personal information with them and last year my dad asked me if I was willing to be his POA and Emergency Contact in case he was unable to make decisions for himself, I agreed. Now my sisters have found out and are upset that they are not listed as a potential POA or EC in anyway. In terms of inheritance, we're still to split things evenly but they don't like the fact that they don't get to make any decisions or wouldn't be directly contacted by his job or the hospital.

They confronted my dad about this and he tried to brush them off but in the end he admitted that he just trusted me more because I was the only child that he felt was truly on his side. My sisters are hurt and saying that he's being sexist. They want me to convince dad to put them on but I am refusing and now that are calling me TA, but I don't see it that way. Am I?

Edit: Spelling/Grammar Errors

ETA: In order to keep myself to writing the same thing over and over I'm just gonna say this....

1. I am the sole POA for everything for my dad, but if anything were to happen to me there is a ""line of succession"": Me, my uncle (dad's younger brother), my uncle's sons (older first and then the younger), and them my dad's Goddaughter.
2. Who said anything about my dad abandoning us if we weren't biologically his? My dad just didn't want to live with the doubt, it's one of the reasons why he divorced my mom, and I agreed to it because I didn't want to end up having sex with someone who I didn't know was my secret half sibling at the time.
3. Again my mom SAYS she never cheated again and while my sisters and I believe her that wasn't good enough for dad, which is reasonable. She also didn't do herself any favors by using the ""it was a long time ago"" line."	588	122	0.96

I graduate from college this May (I am 21F). As long as weather is permitting, it will be held outside and each student is allow six (6) guests. Naturally, I want my 6 guests to be my most immediate family members. 4 of these spots are going to my mom, dad, and grandma and grandpa on my dads side. I no longer have grandparents on my moms side so that’s not relevant here. For my 5th and 6th guests, I invited my aunt and uncle. As of right now, they don’t think they’ll be able to make it. My dad has already asked me if his girlfriend can come if they can’t make it. 

Here’s some backstory: My parents separated in 2019 and finalized the divorce soon after. Since then, my mom has had one steady boyfriend, but my dad has had 3+ girlfriends (I’ve met 3 of them, he may have had more). He’s been with his current girlfriend since early November. I’ve met her a few times and she seems nice enough. I don’t have any problems with her. 

Here’s my issue: My dad has never respected my boundaries when it came to his girlfriends. When I moved to my first apartment, he came to help me and brought along his girlfriend at that time without discussing it with me beforehand. He was already on the road when he called me and said he was bringing someone. I haven’t had any alone time with him in 2 years because he always has another girl with him. My mom, on the other hand, has never forced me to have a relationship with her boyfriend and has always allowed things to be on my terms. She doesn’t bring him to things unless I specifically ask her to. She has overall respected me and my boundaries when it comes to their relationships. 

Overall, it’s not that I don’t WANT my dads girlfriend to come to the graduation ceremony. I would rather just have family. But I don’t want to feel forced by my dad to invite her either. And at the same time, if she came then I would want my moms boyfriend to come, but my dad would freak out and get mad at me if I even suggest that. They will already be coming up the day before to spend time with me. She would just have to sit in the hotel room for a couple hours while the ceremony is happening. 

So Reddit, WIBTA if I didn’t allow my dads girlfriend to come to my graduation ceremony and only kept 4 guests?"	22	16	0.87

When I sent that picture I didn't think much of it, I was just letting my gf know what I was doing, Regina was leaving the states and wanted to see me and Ray, as we had been friends for about a decade by this point.

Regina and I had a relationship, but it didn't work out between us so we broke it off. That was about a year or year and half before I met my gf. When my gf asked who Regina was, I simply answered that she was just our friend who was leaving the states.

Now, we recently had a nasty argument over this, because she straight up asked if I and Regina had something and i confirmed that we did. Ever since then, my gf feels like I have lied to Her and that she can't trust me anymore. Whereas my stance is that I did not lie to her, because Regina is in fact my friend, it had been a while after we had broken up and I just didn't think it was necessary to add possible unnecessary stress at the time.

I'm assuming her take is that I lied by omission. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole?


Tldr: I failed to mention to my gf that my friend who was hanging out with me and our other childhood friend, was also my ex. Did I lie?

Edit: Thank you to everyone who has commented and helping me feel just how royally I have fucked up. I especially want to thank all of you who took a little bit more time to explain to me how I did. I see now that I have much more to learn and many issues to deal with. I appreciate every one of you.

Okay, about 4 years ago my parents split up and my dad (Tom) quickly found a new girlfriend (Lucy). After a few months, we started to go round there and sleep over as she lived quite far away. Whenever we did, me and my siblings would always have to share rooms with her children as there were no spare rooms. I have one brother and there are 3 of them to clarify.

As the sleepovers became more common, we expressed how we didn't like sharing and Tom didn't seem to care that much.

Fast forward to June 2020, and Tom moves in with Lucy meaning I now live at Lucy's House about 30% of the time (with my mum the other 70%). There was a clear problem with rooms. They cleared out an office so there was one spare but it is tiny and not really fit for purpose. After a few months, I had had enough and told my dad that I wanted my own space. 

My justification was that the oldest step brother (Harry) was at university after lockdown and that I should take his room, and my little brother can have the spare room, with Harry using the spare when he is home. Tom and Lucy took some convincing but eventually agreed. However, it is clear that Lucy isn't happy with this, I haven't seen Harry since Lucy told him so I don't know how he feels either.

I know there is no perfect solution either. Someone has to stay in the spare room anyway, which I've said isn't fit for purpose and we're trying to split 4 bedrooms (3 step siblings and the spare) 5 ways.

AITA for taking my step brothers room?

Edit: Thanks for all your responses, all saying I'm NTA. But I would like to reiterate that I am only at Lucy's for 30% of the time, and Harry has had the room for 18 years. It's all very complex but thanks for trying to understand. 😅"	12	11	0.81

She wasn't really liked for some reasons which don't have anything to do with this post. I learnt by a few people that she didn't wear a bra at that meetup, I didn't (and still don't) see that as a problem and that was that, until she left the guild later and then the guys regularly joked about that fact since she wasn't here to see it anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

So I get that they don't like her, I didn't either, and if it was about her personality or things she did which didn't have to do with her appearance, I wouldn't have a problem with it but the only thing they criticize about her (not in private at least) is that she didn't wear a bra in a meetup full of guy even a year later, and of course she was the only one who was criticized, not one man was. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now they're starting to talk about another meetup soon if the situation allows it, and I would be invited if it happens. I would be the only woman there. So I actually like most of those people, it's just that I've seen how they keep criticizing the only woman who went there almost one year later (not that often, but it still happens) and I don't want it to happen to me. I know people would say just go don't worry about others, just do you, but it's not something I can do yet (working on it) as I have low self esteem and it would be really hard on me if I learnt they did something like that about me. I'm not saying all of them would do it, actually not a lot but it's obviously those who talk the most who happens to be the ones like that. 

&amp;#x200B;

It actually wouldn't be the only reason I wouldn't go, but it's part of it. I told of them this and he didn't say much, but he said it to another one who took badly the fact that I think they would judge me and said it's only because they don't like her that they're doing it.

Cassie, his girlfriend/my ex girlfriend is 22F, I’m 23M. 

I dated “Cassie” for two years, right after graduating. We had been close friends throughout high school. Her and my brother had met a handful of times but he joined the military at 18 so he was only home when he was on leave. 

Two years ago, my brother was staying home for a few weeks after a deployment and i caught Cassie cheating on me with him. We broke up and she almost immediately began dating my brother. After a few months they moved in together and my mom and the rest of my family basically just ignored the fact that Cassie and I had ever dated. My mom gave me shit every time I wouldn’t come to a dinner or something they were at. I’ve since moved on, but it’s still weird whenever I see them together so I try to avoid it.

Not long ago they announced they were having a baby. Which is great, I wish them and their kid the best. They’re having a baby shower/gender reveal today that the whole family was invited to and my mom just called me to ask when I’ll be there and I told her I wasn’t going. She told me if I don’t have a legitimate reason not to go I’m being an asshole because this is my niece or nephew and in a few years I’ll regret not letting everything be water under the bridge. 

Like I said I wish the best for them but I don’t really care to be a part of their lives, which is I guess why I think I might be the AH because the kid is technically family.

Everyone always says their dogs are sweet and would never do such a thing, but the owners of the dog that bit me said the same thing and they were shocked when it happened. 

My finance (35m) and I (40f, we're getting married this week) have been together for roughly 2 years and living together for a year and a half. I absolutely adore him. We have a lot in common and generally get along really well. There is just one point of contention... Dogs.  

He has two small, older dogs which he has had since they were puppies. When we first started dating, I hadn't had much exposure to dogs since I was a kid and didn't realize how much my childhood experience had traumatized me. I really tried to spend time with them and let them sit with me on the couch, etc. I helped to feed them and brush them in hopes that my anxiety around them would subside in time and kept telling myself I just needed to grow up and get over it. We've now all been living together for a year and a half, and I can say with certainty that I cannot get over it. I am miserable living with these dogs, and am constantly struggling with anxiety. They bark constantly, and snap and growl at each other and the TV, etc., and I really struggle being in the same room with them. I've tried anxiety meds, CBD, and even therapy to try to deal with my fear but nothing has helped much. So I usually spend most of my time in my home office in our detached garage since I don't feel comfortable in the house with them. Despite all of this, I have not and will not ask him to re-home the dogs. That's not what this is about. I still help feed them, I take them out every day when needed, I take them to the vet when my fiance can't, etc. I'm doing what I can to power through as best I can and be a good dog mom to them while they live out what's left of their happy existence. 

The problem, and the argument we keep having, is what will happen after these two cross over the rainbow bridge. I have made it clear that I do not want to go through this again. I don't want any more dogs. My fiance, however, keeps saying that he ""won't make any promises."" I feel like this is the same as telling someone with a clown phobia, ""too bad, meet your new roommate Chuckles."" He sees how much I struggle with every aspect of dog parenthood, and usually tries to empathize and do what he can to minimize their contact with me, but I feel like if he wants to put me through this again for another 10-15 years with a new dog he is ultimately disregarding my struggle. It's not like we don't have other animals either. We have three cats that he loves so it's not like he's starved for animal companionship. Anyway, I want him to be happy, of course, but not at the expense of my own mental health. Am I the asshole?"	23	31	0.77

Except for the kids, we are all adults. This is how we have all stated in multiple ways and shapes that we want to live, up until the pandemic started last year literally as my youngest was born.  This is when we all noticed a very direct change in my MIL

Three days ago, I was doing my usual chicken routine and got done, brought in eggs etc. my MIL immediately comes behind me and asks if I check a specific chicken who is in a pen alone. I said yes. I did check. She goes out, grabs his food, and comes back to me screaming that I did not, or I would’ve noticed the giant chunks in his food. 

It has been intensely raining where I live, so the food does clump, but the food itself was full and there were plenty of spots said chicken could eat out of. 

MIL proceeds to tell me to ‘get your fatass out there and take care of them or your rent goes up $25 if I start taking care of them.’ She proceeds to call me an ungrateful bitch when I try to show her how he can still eat out of it, and then tells me I (who have lived here for 4 years now as both her sons housewife and mother to my own kids) was not her family, and wasn’t allowed to talk to her that way. 

This is the normal occupancy about once a month. She finds a tiny issue, picks at it till it becomes a fight, and then tells us we are ungrateful slobs, threatens to raise rent, and tells us to get lost from her home. And I told her, ‘you know what, I have the $25 to spare a month on top of the $970 I already pay. You can take care of them now.’

She then proceeds to tell me to buy our own groceries(we somewhat do? Though it’s mostly to contribute to the house- not ourselves specifically) and she wanted us to fuck off. 

But I am at my wits end. I’m about to tell my FIL(who is the only one who will talk and not scream) that I will pay half the bills, buy our own food and cook it, clean only our things, I will even go to a laundromat, but I will not be partaking in anything my MIL needs anymore. As before- I was cleaning her house either her and for her, cooking dinners for everyone as she rarely cooks because it ‘overwhelms’ her, and I would frequently go to the grocery and pharmacy for her(though I did have her money or card in hand)

I will admit that this is not as high powered of an airhorn as the ones that you usually see (you manually pump air into this one), but nevertheless, it's an airhorn, its sole purpose is to make noise. After he blows out my eardrums (this is an exaggeration but I was using noise cancelling headphones at the time and it was still loud to me so I know it was loud to my friends), I quickly disconnected my headset and aggressively asked him what his problem was.

He proceeds to tell me that I need to chill out and that I'm an asshole for disconnecting my mic whenever anyone walks into my room because I will feel embarrassed if they hear anything ""normal."" I will admit that I do pull out my microphone whenever I hear someone walk in and I may be a little overly cautious about it, but it is exactly for just in case reasons like this. My brother often walks in and does ""funny"" things like this that he knows I hate and whenever he tells me that I need to chill, I always find it comparable to those asshole friends who will do weird shit and say, ""it's just a prank bro."" I used to keep my mic connected whenever I knew I would just have a brief and normal conversation (I would always disconnect it in the case of a long conversation since it doesn't concern my friends and I feel like they don't want to hear that stuff when they're trying to play), but he's started to do this so often that I disconnect my mic every time someone enters. So AITA for putting my friends and self-esteem before my family? Do you have any other perspective on this? Let me know if you need me to clarify anything!

Edit: Thanks for all the nice comments! It's really nice to be able to get an outside and less biased perspective on this so that I understand my situation better.

Edit 2: Someone asked how old he is. He is turning 18 in two months and heading off to college soon. I am about 2 1/2 years younger than him and out of shape so there is not much that I can do about it personally. I just hope he grows out of it during college and doesn't treat his roommates the same way."	74	37	0.94

It was there idea for me to attend a school near my house so I could stay at home instead of staying away from my house for various, semi-legit reasons as well as my mom can be a bit of a control freak of sorts.

So, where I live it has been a very consistent level of hot, around 30 degrees Celsius or just a tad lower. I am a bigger guy and get very hot very easily, coupled with living on the top floor of our house. The basement on one hand is fairly chilled, the main floor is hot but the top floor is the worst.

I asked my parents to turn on the AC to which they reply they won’t because the weather isn’t consistent enough (even though it is fairly consistent)  to turn the  ac on and it won’t be going on until July. I explained to them how unbearable my room is and they just prompted me with either opening a window or sleeping on the floor in the basement. 

Neither of these options really seemed to tempting so I took it upon myself to go out and buy myself a portable AC unit that just plugs into the wall and it has worked wonderfully.

I came home from a long day of work (which was outside all day from 6:30-6) hoping to be able to sit in my nice beautifully conditioned room only to find my unit was gone. I asked my parents and they told me they took it because it was so disrespectful of me after they said no AC to go out and get one without there permission. 

This just led to an argument where I said just because you’re willing to sit and suffer in the heat doesn’t mean I am, and my mom just said how rude and entitled I was and now both my parents have had an attitude around me and been making off handed comments."	58	75	0.92

For background, last year my car died and i had to sell it, so since then  we had been using my partner's car until it died in March. I have a car  we can use, albeit not too much since it isn't ours, and have been  shopping around for a new car. I found one that needs the A/C repaired  and the car dealership is taking care of that as I type this, but it's  been about 3 weeks of this repair, and looking around, I can't find a  different car that is as nice as this one for the price.

She's been  getting more irate as of late, saying that she wants to be able to go  out and do errands, understandably, which we can do, but then brings up  going further than just doing errands as her complaint when I bring up  that we can easily go to the store and do other small trips in our area,  as we have done many times before with this car. It's gotten to the  point that I'm renting cars so we can go places further away, just to  keep her happy, and that isn't good enough for her. By the way, she's  the one with a job as I'm finishing school and doing job searching these  next few weeks. The only thing I can think of is she's stressed about  wedding planning?

Needless to say, I just want to know, am I in the wrong for waiting 3 weeks or more for this specific car repair? By the way, as  a note, the car place has taken it to 2 repair places, one of which had  it for a week and didn't even touch it, and the repair was a faulty A/C control Module."	12	18	0.87

At the beginning of this year, my parents (whom I live with currently) gave me (22F) a notice that they’ll be moving to Kentucky by the middle or end of the year. I had the option of moving with them or finding a place to live here in my home state. I really like the new job I got last year so I decided I would stay. I first started looking for apartments and then my mom gave me the idea of applying for a house loan. 

Around this same time, my best friend (22F) was having issues with her fiancé: financial and relationship. He was laid off until Spring for his job and she was working what she could to keep the place while his unemployment checks came in. They were behind on a lot of bills and she accumulated some credit card debt to pay rent/buy groceries/take care of their pets. Things didn’t end up working out for them so he moved into his parents house one day while she wasn’t home and left her with the responsibility of paying for the accumulated bills. 

For a while she manages to keep the apartment, but ultimately she moves out to live with her Grandma while she gets back on her feet. I didn’t want to live with her at first because we hadn’t worked out well the first time I had a place with her so when she asked me to be a roommate after he left, I declined. After all this though, I have a home loan and began looking for places in my price range. I felt bad and wanted to help her out. I offered for her to live with me when I get a house and she’d only have to pay a little of the rent so she could get back on her feet. 

She was excited about this and accepted, saying,” I only need a place to stay anyway until the end of the year because I want to move to Florida.” I was fine with this and began looking. Since this interaction, I’ve noticed I’m more wary of her spending habits. She eats out a lot and ends up wasting most of the food cause she can’t eat it all, bought a ticket to Florida with what money she had to take a little vacation (she just got a new job and is taking time off to go on a trip???), got a fresh set of nails for this trip, and has told me about purchases she’s made while down there.

She already owes me money for gas, food, and other stuff she “needed”. I don’t know if she intends to pay me back since she’s spending the money she does get from work on stuff like this. I don’t want her to live with me anymore and don’t know how she’ll take it when I tell her. I’ve already found a house I’m in contract with, but if she can’t pay me now, how can I trust her to help with bills if she would move in?"	24	11	0.9

I (21 F) am originally from the States but have been going to uni in the United Kingdom for the past 3 years. After my first year of uni my parents began to comment on my accent changing and sounding less American. I did start to pick up a bit of a british accent but only in the way in which I would pronounce certain words, but it is not a full blown accent. Most people from hearing my voice are not able to really tell where I am from as I have been told that my accent sounds like a mix of both British and American English dialects. I have not done this intentionally but I have just unconsciously begun to mimick the voices of those who I talk to. When I visit the US my accent quickly falls back into an American accent and when I go back to the U.K. It changes after a few weeks. The biggest change I have noticed is my vocabulary for instance I am more inclined to use “lovely” over “nice” and I use the word “quite” a lot before adjectives.
The other day I was calling my mother and I was talking about my day and referred to my roommate as my flatmate and said I had a “bit of a lie in today” rather than saying “I slept in today”. My mother got really mad and went on a rant about how I am being very fake and need to work on being more authentic and kept reminding me that I am not British and am an American. She also said I was being very offensive to British people and that they probably find it weird and rude when they hear my accent. I truly am not faking my accent it has just kinda happened at the end of my first year at uni and had continued but I definitely do not have a full british accent, just a slight one when I say certain words and my vocabulary is resembles more of a British dialect.

Background: I've been friends with, we'll call them R, for 10+ years but I haven't actually been able to see them in person in the last 3-4 years due to work/life/etc (we live a good 5-6 hours away from each other). They made a big deal about not being able to go to the nearest large city to me to see others unless they see me first because they would feel 'too guilty'. It never bothered me. Go where you want in life, ya know?

Now for the issue that brought this on: Since a holiday weekend is coming up they decided it was the perfect time to visit and acted all excited about it. I was happy because I really do miss my friend and I was happy to get to spend time together again. Well not long after making plans (within a week) they cancelled because suddenly (as in it wasn't mentioned before) their SO's family has plans. Today I finally messaged R and told them how they made me feel. How I was tired of always getting my hopes up to hang out (this isn't the first time they've cancelled. It's quite common and now most people we know expect it to happen). And how I really only felt like a friend when they wanted something. (Normally I let it all slide because I know R suffers from some anxiety/depression just like I do but for some reason this really got to me and I couldn't keep quiet.) R responded by sending me multiple messages, all containing promises and excuses as to why they do this. All things they've said before when ""called out"" by their behavior. They want to talk tomorrow (supposedly) and I don't even know if it's worth it at this point. AITA for feeling this way and handling it this way?

Extra: I kept the SO and family out of the messages to R because it's not about the SO and family I understand when family/SO things pop up sometimes. It's about a lack of respect for my time and feelings over and over again."	6	10	0.88

I have recently moved to a new house in a good neighborhood. Every week, I take the garbage bins outside and the next day, I have to bring them back in once the garbage truck empties them. But my neighbor's dog always gets really aggressive and starts barking crazily whenever I do this. It's a big dog and I can hear it scratching at our shared fence and barking whenever I move the garbage bins. I have talked to my neighbor about this and she said that her dog is a rescue and has trauma when it comes to loud noises (the bin's wheels are loud), so that is why it is so aggressive. 

She wanted me to stop triggering her dog's trauma and suggested that I take out and put in the bins when she takes her dog for a walk. So every week for the past few months she texts me when she takes out her dog and I go and put out/bring in the bins. But yesterday I had to go somewhere and I couldn't wait for her to take the dog out, so when I put out the bins the dog got aggressive again. She came out and got upset at me for ""purposefully triggering her dog's trauma."" I really don't want to cause mental pain for her dog, but I don't think I can keep waiting for her to take the dog out every single week for the rest of my life, because it's annoying to spend my whole day watching for her texts and constantly remembering that I have to take out/bring in the bins, when doing it first thing in the morning will just get it over with. I don't know anymore, I asked my mom and she told me that ""it's the least you can do for the poor dog."" Am I being selfish?

TLDR: Neighbor's dog gets triggered whenever I move my garbage cans so I have to move them while she's taken it for a walk. It is an inconvenience for me, especially when I have to go out and can't wait for them. But I also don't want to harm the dog."	71	73	0.89

So on Friday night there were plans to go as a group of coworkers/friends to go to a bar in town for a few drinks. This is something we used to do pre pandemic but since the pandemic and some colleagues leaving (and not being replaced by management) as well as a few others having families the group that regularly attends is much smaller with a few that come when they're free. This Friday the only people that were free due to a lot of last minute self isolating was me (24M) and my colleague Ash (about the same age F). Me and Ash are decent friends and being 2 of the youngest people in the office without kids tend to stay out after everyone else has gone home leaving just the two of us. This time however, knowing it would just be me and Ash all night I cancelled and instead went out with some of the lads I used to go to school with.


Going to work today made the usual chat with everyone, weathers boiling, how was your weekend etc, when Ash asked what I'd been up to so I said I went out with some old friends and asked what she'd done over the weekend. This seemed to have made her really annoyed as she went off on me for cancelling last minute and leaving her with no plans Friday, when she had no other plans to go out the rest of the weekend and felt it was wasted. I apologised for the last minute notice but honestly I wasn't that sorry.


Anyway Ash ignored me all day, I invited her to get lunch with me and two of the other staff but she refused and went on her own to the cafe and at lunch my colleagues told me it was pretty harsh to waste her evening.


I thought it would just be a more enjoyable night and didnt think about what other plans were available for Ash. AITA?"	10	33	0.6

I got a new mattress, and I haven’t let him on it yet. I was considering letting him back on and talked to my mom for advice. 

We talked about it for a little while- she was concerned about keeping the bed clean, and I told her that I could keep it clean and also that being allowed on the bed helps him to do his job much better (he is an ESA), helping me function much better by extension. 

She didn’t buy the bed or the mattress, I am the only one who uses that bed, and my dog would only be on my bed, so the decision really only affects me. So when she said she’d think about letting me let him on my bed, I was confused and said that it’s really my decision since he won’t be on any other furniture. She got frustrated and ended the conversation. 

I meant no disrespect, but my relationship with my mom is such that sometimes I have to set boundaries over the things that she can control. Is this not one of those times? AITA?

ETA: my parents didn’t buy the mattress, but I didn’t buy it either- it was a gift from a family friend who is moving into my room with me, because I needed a new bed so that hers would fit in the room"	5	34	0.61

I had hoped that she would find other friends where she moved, but she became super depressed, as she could never leave home and didn’t make friends. In April, our mutual friends and I offered to buy her a ticket so she could come to visit us during Easter. I’ve never been well off in terms of money so that mutual friend decided to pay for the entire 200$ ticket since she was better off financially. While she was here, she stayed at our houses and we paid for the majority of her food. Flash forward 2 months. She was supposed to come back down to where we live for about a month, but her parents weren’t able to pay for her to come down here, so her trip was canceled. The plane tickets are about 400-600$ and none of us want to pay for it, as we are all high schoolers who work minimum wage jobs. For the next few weeks, she complains about not being able to leave home, missing parties, and having to stay in her awful household with nothing to do. To make her happy, 5 of us plan to split a ticket, excluding her, of &gt;400$ to fly her down. The plan was for all of us to send her about 100$ so she could buy a plane ticket down here and stay for two weeks. I found a ticket for 20$ less online, and I offered to buy it, as long as everyone else chipped in as promised. The time comes to buy the ticket, and all 4 people back out on buying it. I had already told my friend I'd buy her the ticket and she was holding me to it. However, I didn't have the money in my bank account to buy it in full, so I borrowed 255$ from a friend to purchase the ticket. I found a coupon offline and got her a ticket for about 380$. Flash forward 2 weeks, she arrives in our hometown. She has &lt;100$ to spend for the 2 weeks she’ll be here. I don't get to see her much because of my strict parents, however, I do bring her to work with me, when she asks to go. I work at a snow cone stand, family-owned. Because she doesn't have much money, I end up paying for her, and the two other guys I work with most days. The price for each meal I buy is about 30$ for all of us, and I typically buy them lunch and dinner. I dropped way below my comfort limit in my checking account. So, I told her and the other two guys I work with that I will not be buying meals for all of them anymore. One of our mutual friends said to buy my friend lunch since she didn't have any money. I said ""No, I've already spent at least 600$ on her since she got here. She can either buy her own lunch or eat at home."" My friend responded, ""I didn't ask you to do all of that for me."" But she did. This friend often asks for things. A few weeks prior to me buying her plane ticket, she asked me to buy her a 100$ dress, as well as other items. Asked me to pay for half of a 20$ dress. She often asks for people to send her money and buy things for her, and usually gets what she wants. If she doesn't she gets upset about it.

I've been dealing with a lot this year and it's my final days here and I'm just chilling with my lady eating some flavored ice. All is well. Out of nowhere these two lady's come by on the rented bikes from around the trees, but they aren't on the path, they're on the grass; one almost hits me, the other wobbles to the right and gets on the sidewalk. Like we're under this big tree and like you literally gotta be cutting through the grass to get to where we were, they were probably coming from the Barefoot Cafe.

The lady, this horribly tanned blond shouts at me to watch where I'm going and calls me an asshole. Granted, I did almost back into her, but while standing under the tree well away from any path or sidewalk I'm not expecting a bike, little less a person.

Thing is, it's hard to shake my mood here on the island so I just say and 'Good Effin Day to you too.'.

I think it's over, but we notice a little handbag. Like i guess, like one of those big lady wallets on the ground. Amy picks it up and asks if I think it's the lady's and we open it up and it was hers. Though she pale as snow in the picture, it's unmistakable. Amy asks if I think I can catch them, and I said I didn't know. But she insist I try, even though they were rude. So I jog over to the little kiosk, get a bike and race down the street trying to find this lady.

I almost give up after 20 minutes, cause I can't really find them and I know at my speed I should have caught them. Riding back I just happened to be on the other side of the street I see them in this Cheeseburger Spot, it's called Paradise or something. I hop off my bike and approach and say excuse me, as they are sitting like right at the bar. The lady ignores me at first, but I stand next to her and say 'excuse me you dropped this'.

What follows is about 5 minutes of this woman assuming I'm either hitting on her, a waiter, or begging for money. She's super rude and won't let me get a word in edgewise. I have the damn bag in my hand, but she doesn't seem to notice it. Then her friend recognizes me, and I think things will get normal and civil and she goes, what an apology, because your clumsy. And I'm like... speechless cause this doesn't seem like real life. I make the mistake of asking is she okay, because none of this seems warranted at all and she cusses me out for 3 more minutes before a staff asks if I'm bothering her and if I was there to eat. I said no, I just needed to talk to her. I still have the thing in my hand, and I wave it at her ass, but she's doesn't notice scoffing and turning away. So I leave.

So embarrassed and pretty pissed, I decide to just chuck her shit in the trash and ride back to my wife. When I tell her what happen, she says I was petty. I could have just left the lady's bag on the counter. I told my mom and she somehow agrees. Somehow I'm the asshole here. AITA?"	1678	401	0.92

He’s been dating his girlfriend “GF” for about 2 years now, but she honestly earns probably 10% of what my brother makes. However, they split costs evenly on everything which would of course be fine except that my brother wants her to move in with him and pay rent.

I’ve become pretty good friends with GF, and she told me she was upset because my brother wants her to pay half the mortgage and utilities, etc. which she absolutely cannot afford. It’s a very expensive house. This isn’t a one time issue either, my brother has developed “champagne tastes” but expects her to pay half the costs of these tastes she literally cannot afford. They both then came to me about it together because I think they felt I was a “neutral party” in some ways. 

Basically, I was blunt with them. I said they need to discuss financials and that any healthy couple would have to confront how to approach earnings if they want to continue long term. Either (a) my brother needs to shoulder more cost or (b) they need to spend less, including on housing. My brother made clear those were not options he would accept. So I said the simplest solution is to not move in together, but they’ll need to address this issue at some point or accept they’re not actually expecting to be together long term. 

Basically, GF took the last point to heart and felt that my brother wasn’t serious about a relationship if he couldn’t compromise on the issue. My brother is furious with me and told our family I broke them up by telling GF to date a guy who will spend money on her.

My family is now pissed at me too and brother calls GF and me a gold digger (I’m a lawyer and earn the same as husband for context). Here’s especially where I think I’m TA. I told brother the only one who cares about marrying someone with money is him, and he’s the “greedy gold digger” who will never be happy because he cares more about money than the people he  loves. I hate that I said that because my point with GF wasn’t even the money, it was that brother created an impossible situation for GF and refused to compromise or be flexible which is necessary for a lasting relationship.

Family is demanding an apology for everything, so now I’d really appreciate a third party opinion on whether I’m TA or if I have a warped view on relationships and finances."	5638	420	0.98

So. I (20nonbinay) was seeing this guy (not dating just talking). Over the time we were talking he had bought me a few things as well as paid for a portion of my phone bill. To make it clear I never asked him to do any of that. I mentioned that I was going to buy these things myself once I was able to and he ended up buying a few things for me. As well as I told him my phone was going to be cut off temporarily so I wouldn’t be able to message him as much when I wasn’t on wifi, he offered to pay it, I denied multiple times, when he continued to push it I accepted. There were a lot of reasons I decided to end things, he was getting possessive, accusing me of lying almost daily, and insulted me a few times. I decided it would be best to break the news in person. I pick him up, he asks if we can drive a bit down the road from his place (maybe 15 min) I ask if we can stay there, he insists. We hang out for a bit but when he asked when we would do it again I break the news. He flips out. He’s yelling and screaming at me and accuses me of using him for money. He yells at me for so long that I have a panic attack in my car. I tell him I want to leave and go home. I tell him to let me drive him home so I can go home. He says ‘I’m never getting in your car bitch’. I leave and I have my eyes locked on the road, I don’t look at him while I’m leaving because I’m trying to calm down and I’m scared. I get somewhere with wifi when I stop for gas (my phone ended up getting shut down despite him helping me while my bill) and he’s spammed me with texts and calls. Hes mad i left him on the side of the road. I offer to drive back and pick him up and drive him home but he gets nasty with me so I hung up. By the time I get home it’s worse. I feel guilty I left him there as well as for accepting money. He also blamed me for losing his job because he called out sick ‘to hang out with me’ but our plans didn’t start until after his shift ended so I take no responsibility for that. 
Am i the asshole here? He seems to think so and I feel bad.

Edit: Thank you for everyone’s input. I did block him very soon after but he did find ways to reach me for the next few months. It ended when he decided to spam call my phone while I was highly agitated due to a death in my immediate family and I REALLY drove the point home I wasn’t interested. The reason I didn’t mention that is because it was much later and well deserved.
 I felt guilty about the money because I did accept it when I should have known better from being financially abused in the past. And I felt guilty for leaving him on the side of the road because I drove him out there. Thank you everyone because I don’t feel guilty anymore and I do feel justified."	5	20	0.78

A chain auto store near my house advertises a service where they run a diagnosis to see what the problem with the engine is. I went to said store, but unfortunately their system was down and they could not run the diagnosis. So the employee helping me called their other location in my town to ask if their system was working. After getting confirmation that it was, he told them I was coming and sent me to the other store.

Well, when I got to the second location, I was told that they were not offering this diagnosis service due to Covid. I said that I had been sent by the other store, and that they hadn't said anything about the service not being offered. The guy just kept shrugging his shoulders and saying it wasn't allowed. Then he asked me if I knew how to do it. Because apparently he can give me the tools to do it, but can't do it himself? This was the last straw for me, and I yelled, ""No I don't know how, that's your job! You're useless!"" Then I stormed out.

If its their policy not to offer this service due to covid, so be it. But why was one location able to do it, but not the other? Why would the second location tell the first to send me there if they couldn't do it? There was no signs in the store, nor anything on their website saying this service wasn't available.

So, AITA for yelling at this guy. And, WIBTA if I filed a complaint?

Edit: I called the first store. The person I talked to said that there was no policy about not offering diagnosis services that he was aware of.

Edit 2: I decided to take my chances and called the second store. I asked to speak with a manager. I explained the situation. He told me that due to covid, he had been allowing his employees to decide for themselves what services they were comfortable doing. I can accept I was the asshole for yelling at the guy now that I've calmed down, but according to the manager, the employee was in the wrong too, as he should have called an an employee who was willing to do the test over."	10	27	0.71

It started off when I got home right after school. I cleaned myself off, changed my clothes and asked my dad for permission if I could play since it’s his day off. He usually doesn’t use the tv much unless it’s his day off.  I didn’t know the day we were going to play together was his day off as his work schedule has changed recently. He told me it was fine and I turned on my console. After taking a piss, I get back to the living room and see him change the screen and lay on the couch with some snack. I grab my stuff, and give him a look. To me, he acted aloof like he forgot I was going to use it but that could just be because I got a bit mad.

He asked me, “Oh we’re you going to use it?” I reply with “No you’re fine”. I still had around an hour and 20 minutes until we were supposed to get on. 40 minutes pass by and I tell him that I need to get on soon, I’m going to play with a friend. He gives me a thumbs up and I got back to my room. 40 minutes pass again and I ask him if I can use the tv, he says he’s in the middle of a movie and after that I can use it. I stare at him and walk away. Calmed down for a few minutes which then turn to half an hour. I ask him again and he gets slightly angry and tells me to wait.

Another what feels like 15 minutes passes by and at this point I won’t take no for an answer.  I walk over to the living room again, find him snoring and ask him again if I could use the tv. He gets frustrated and angry and said he’s watching something. I tell him he was sleeping and snoring which he retorts with “watching with his eyes closed”. I inform him how I was planning to play with my friend about an hour ago. He gets up and complains about how all I want to do is interrupt him while he watches and let’s me get on. I get on a just about what I expected, they’re not there anymore. I let him know he can use the tv since my friend is offline and head back to my room. My brother seems to catch onto this or just wants to use the tv so he starts watching his shows I assume that my dad won’t be able to watch his.

I recognize I could be TA for not being a bit more firmer in the beginning and not telling him my plans. I could also be TA for disturbing him even when I knew that my friend probably wouldn’t be online anymore. I was just hoping. I also missed out on chances where I could have used it, when he was sleeping I could have grabbed the tv remote.

So my redditor judges, AITA?

Now, here is the issue. While I know said grandma and aunt well, I DO NOT know the eight year old grandchild. I don't know what she looks like, what she likes, I literally only know her name. And because my mother has kicked me out of my room in the past so someone else can sleep in there, I asked her how the sleeping arrangement would be. And she said I'd be sleeping in my brother's former room (he's moved out already) ON THE COUCH WITH MY GRANDMA and my aunt and her granddaughter (I don't even know in what way she's related to me) would be sleeping in MY room. And I said no. I said that, under no certain circumstances, I'd be letting an eight year old child I don't know sleep in MY room with all my valuables, consoles and posters, I'm not keen on having something destroyed. I generally refuse to be kicked out of my room again in favor of others. It's MY room. My Mom said I shouldn't be making such a fuss about it and that it's just for the night and that she wouldn't be staying in there all the time, but how would she wanna know if the kid stays in there or not if my room is suddenly treated like a guest room? So would I be the asshole if I put my foot down and stay adamant about her NOT being allowed to sleep in my room and that I won't let myself be kicked out of it again? She can stay in my brother's room, since it isn't occupied. I mean, the kid will be supervised as the aunt is supposed to sleep in the same room, but still.

We don’t hang out as much anymore, but try to get together 2 or 3 times a year to catch up. 

One friend has been completely silent on the group for almost a year. Ignoring plans to meet up, not even feigning an excuse, just totally mute. They have always been a bit more peripheral than some of us which is cool, live your life. 

This is also the main reason no one really asked them what was up for a while, it wasn’t unusual for them to be less responsive and then I guess it just got awkward. One of the people in the WhatsApp group had mentioned they’d been in hospital recently and they didn’t even reply to that to ask how they were which is a bit strange. The radio silence continued until a couple of weeks ago, when they popped up to invite us all to their birthday as if they hadn’t been AWOL for a year. 

This is someone who likes to throw big parties for their birthday, and has confided in the past that they get anxious about not enough people showing up to them. I feel kind of confused that they haven’t been interested in hanging out with us or even speaking to us, but now want us to show up for their birthday - it feels a bit like they just want us there as “padding” for the party. As I said they are a peripheral friend and have their own main friend group. 

This person has hung out with other mutual friends and is ostensibly fine, my partner knows their partner so we know there has been no major life event and that they’re ok etc. WIBTA if I didnt show up and didn’t give an excuse? Like, I don’t want to be set decoration for your life, if you don’t want to be friends anymore then don’t be, you can’t have it both ways!"	9	17	0.8

Since then my dad has always been overprotective and smothering. We were always to young to do something ( it was a whole thing when I came out as bi) and when we started dating he had to meet each person before we could go out with them and no girl or guy has been good enough for him and he doesn't let us date.

I've been secretly dating my bf ""Jensen"" for a few months now and he's incredibly kind and sweet to me and always super gentleman like. My sister knows about him and helps me keep him a secret from my dad and will sometimes drive me around to meet him under the guise of us hanging out while she spends time with her own secret bf.

Jensen had given me a cute note last week and I forgot it in my jeans, which my dad found Sunday and he was pissed. He confronted me and  told me he had to meet Jensen or we had to break up and that i was grounded for going behind his back. I told him I wasn't going to break up with Jensen just to appease him and he got even more pissed and now he's making me wait till next year to take my drivers test (something that was scheduled this week).

I've had this watch for a few years, and I have never worn it nor do I plan to. As such I decided that if I could get enough money by selling it, that I would pay the medical bill outright and be done with it (The bill was slightly under $300. For reference, the watch sells for about $600 so I thought I had a good shot of getting half of that). I found a local jeweler and set up an appointment with him (\~65M). The entire interaction was pretty uncomfortable, but NOT in a creepy way. He was just unprofessional: he rescheduled the day of the appointment after we had decided on a date/time, was late to the rescheduled appointment, and the whole time, I felt like I was being rushed through. 

He tested the watch to ensure that it was real gold, weighed the watch, and then did math on his phone to make an offer. At the end, I sold the watch for slightly over $300, walked out, and immediately did a mobile deposit before paying the medical bill online.  Two days later, I got an email asking for me to give him over $100 back because of a mistake that he made during the calculations. I understand that he was buying for the gold content and apparently messed up that calculation, but the watch also had 2  diamonds which add to the value as well as the watch mechanism itself (again, it is at minimum a $600 watch). Even if I wanted to, I no longer have the money.  I think I may be the AH because even though he has contacted me 3 times asking for the money, I chose to not respond. It feels wrong that a) he's asking me to give him money back even though we did a legitimate transaction b) he has messaged me more than once, getting slightly aggressive and c) based on him asking for money back, I don't think he would take it well that I am unwilling to do so"	1518	117	0.97

However, since then she has complained about it, saying that the time commitment to the job has forced her to quit cheer, and that she has to eat all the unhealthy food there as an employee and has been gaining weight as a result. She also thinks I’m reducing her free time that she spends with her friends.

I was packing up my car while my wife was at work, and my MIL drove up, blocked my car with hers so I couldnt leave, and proceeded to call me a psycho among other names, and even tried to get my cell phone from me so (I assume) I wouldnt be able to reach anyone. In hindsight, Im not sure why I didnt call the police. The experience left me traumatized, and I vowed then and there that I wouldnt see her again, EVER.

My wife and I then got back together a few months later, and after explaining what happened, she told me that she understood why I felt the way I did. However, her tune has changed over time, and now we are getting into fights over MIL. My wife wants us all to get along for the sake of the family as a whole, especially since her mom is apart of holidays, family events, etc. Ive changed my mind slightly and have agreed to be cordial for ""family's sake"", but I refuse to be friendly. I also told my wife that if MIL gets too friendly with me, as my wife, she should shut it down. Ive kept my foot down on this boundary, but my wife isnt too happy about it. She keeps telling me that we should all be a family, that MIL is a friendly person, that she wont do that again, qnd that Im an adult and should let it go. I told her that this is my boundary, and she should be by my side and respect my wishes in this matter. I also said that her loyalty should be to me first and foremost. She now is telling me that I am not respecting HER wishes for me to just ""be nice"" and I said back that MIL should be lucky that she even gets a ""hello"" from me. 

I hate that my wife and I are fighting about MIL because in the grand scheme of things, its DUMB. I just want my.wife to respect my boundary, she wants bygones to be bygones. AITA for my stance in this?

Edit: Some of you have been asking whether MIL has ever lashed out like this before, and Id like to address it. Let me start from the beginning. MIL has a history of abusive and controlling behavior, specifically toward my wife. When we met, MIL had control over everything. My wife didnt have a bank account, didnt know how to get one (or apply for a credit card). She lived on her own, granted, but it was on family-owned property, and she worked with her mom. Im sure you can all guess where the paychecks went. 

My wife had no idea that this wasnt normal behavior for a family, and although this sounds self-grandizing, I basically had to tell her how to ""be an adult."" She got a job away from MIL, got her own bank account, and went directly to her aunt (who owns the house) for bills instead of going through MIL like before. The lack of control seems to have made things worse for her and MIL. She would call at all hours, making my wife go.out and do things for her, then would yell and scream at her. I was powerless to stop all this, as I cant tell my wife who to have in her life and who not to, but if it were up to me, we would be NC.

The relationship between my wife and I broke apart at the time because my wife was abusing drugs. I didnt know how bad it was until I decided to leave. The problem had been going on for a long time, and I regret to say that I was an enabler even though I thought I was helping. The night I decided to leave, my wife asked MIL to drive by to see if I was packing up. JUST DRIVE BY. This is not what happened, as the original post says. When I later told wife what happened, she was furious and became LC with MIL for about a year, with MIL being on best behavior. My wife has also gotten the help she needs and has been sober for over two years now (when we got back together). I too have gotten the counceling I need for this situation, but my relationship with MIL (I feel) has been damaged to the point of no return. Im not quite sure why my wife wants her mom in her life still, but again, Im not gonna tell her who she can and cant have in her life. I, however, can choose to have who I want in MY life, and MIL is not really one of them. I want to support my.wife by being cordial, but this is all. I think I have a damn good reason."	1395	115	0.97

1of her cousins got her a job and everyone helped her get health insurance and get settled in so she could start her life over. 4 months ago she told one of my nieces a very big lie about her uncle all hell broke lose and she ended up in the er for a psych eval and spent the next month in a locked unit. While she was in there my family decided she needed to go to a long term facility or she would not be allowed back in the apartment. The hospital told her she didn't qualify for a long term progm they recommend a outptnt progrm they released her they did kick her out of her apartment so I am letting her stay with me. She did complete the outpatient program &amp; she also got a job &amp; has been working every day &amp; doing well.

My family is mad at me for letting her stay with me since she didn't go to an inpatient program. I say its not her fault they decided outpatient however she was in the inpatient program for a month &amp; got help and is doing well.

My roommate and I are both white dudes, his friend is a black woman who is a kind hearted, gracious individual. Both my roommate and his friend are big time activists. Not the insufferable armchair sjw kind. They’re both heavily involved with climate and social justice organizations. 

We were all chatting and my roommate was joking around with me. He always does this same bit over and over where he asks me “who am I thinking of?” and I always say “who?” and after some stupid back and forth he’ll finally say “MY ROOMMATE!!”

He literally does this several times a day, everyday. I usually humor him, but there are times where I’m slightly annoyed because it gets old and tiresome after a while. 

Today was no exception. So he’s doing his usual bit of asking “who he’s thinking of???” and I’m getting tired of it so I answer “you know I know.” 

He responds “Say it! Say their name!!”

So I try to quickly think of some sarcastic answer and I just say “Breonna Taylor” 

My roommate abruptly stops and says “That’s not funny. I don’t like what you said.” 

So now I feel like a racist asshole and I leave the room. I was pretty sure I heard his friend laugh at my “joke” but he quickly changes the subject as I leave. He told me after that what I said was inappropriate and offensive. 

My immediate reaction is defensiveness. I wasn’t trying to make light of a serious topic, just an attempt at a sarcasm to an annoying daily bit that’s gone on for far too long. I was coming in with the mindset that they’re both activists who think about social justice often so the “name” he was thinking of was Breonna Taylor. Though I understand making jokes about serious events can be offensive. 

As for his friend, idk what she thinks about it. It could’ve been (and it sounded like) a genuine laugh, but it could’ve been a laugh of discomfort maybe?

I’ve been back and forth in my head about this and it’s been bugging me. If I was in the wrong, I want to let go of my ego and just own what I said and apologize.

We became friends through other mutual friends and will occasionally grab a beer during lunch, but won't really hang out together unless it's an-involved bigger group activity (like bowling). He's a nice guy, likes good music and *The Yankees* but isn't weird about it since he knows I don't know shit about baseball. 

Anyway last year, my SO and I were invited to his wedding and got a *Save the Date* in the mail. Due to the pandemic, the wedding was postponed and they had to reschedule for this year. 

They sent out revised *Save The Dates* and the wedding falls on a weekend that my SO and I are planning to move. We couldn't do it any other weekend, and since Brett is only a casual friend I figured he wouldn't be heartbroken if we couldn't make it to his big day...especially considering the circumstances. Moving is hella stressful. At some point they mailed us an RSVP, but the house is in such chaos right now I'm almost positive I threw it away by accident. 

I figured it was no big deal, I was meeting Brett for lunch anyway (this was last week) and I'd just let him know in-person that we weren't able to make it, but we'd still get him a gift off his wedding registry. I was aiming for the *Kitchen Aid* toaster.

Brett and I met for a beer and it was a good lunch, we chatted about work and video games, etc. and of course the topic of the wedding came up. He asked me if I got my RSVP and I told him we received it. I explained the situation, said it was unavoidable but we were going to be moving that weekend and wouldn't be able to make it. He seemed only mildly disappointed, but totally understood. But then that's where the problem came up. 

He asked me to just mail back in the RSVP with ""no"" in the box. I asked why, since I was telling him in-person. He was insistent that I send him back a physical copy. I asked if I could just text him a reminder so he could write it down. He said he gets a lot of texts per day. I asked maybe an email reminder? he refused, said he gets a lot of work emails.  

Me: “Why do I need to mail back the card? I just told you I’m not coming?”

Brett: “I’ll forget... The cards are the only way for me to keep track.”

Me: “Well, I may have already thrown it out.”

Brett: “What? Why?!”

Me: “I knew we were meeting! And, well, I'm pretty sure it didn’t have pre-paid postage!”

Brett: “Oh, so that’s it, huh? Can’t spare the extra 47¢?”

Me: “It’s 2021! Who even has stamps?! I’d need to find out where a post office is, then do I walk? Take an Uber? And once I’m there, do I buy a single stamp or a full sheet? Maybe one of those rolls? It’s just all too much.”

Brett: “Maybe it’s better that you don’t come.”

Me: “I wasn't coming anyway!”

I offered to write down my RSVP on a napkin for him but the lunch was pretty much over.

I'm still getting him a toaster.

AITA?

**EDIT**

Not that it really matters but Brett is still getting an $80 toaster out of this

We met and started dating when I was an intern for the same company he works at. We didn't break any rules because although he was higher than me in the company we were on different teams and he had no say in my job. Well in January I started working there remotely full time. Even though we were still on different teams and he had no say in my job or day to day work I wanted to tell HR about us just to cover our bases. However we ended up not saying anything because my mom and boyfriend convinced me it wasn't a smart move. 

My office in mid January announced that those employees who were vaccinated had the choice to work in office or continue working from home. Excited I flew in from Texas because, I wanted to experience what it's like to work in a corporate office, and I also needed to start looking for a place to live. I booked an apartment with airbnb for the two weeks I was supposed to be up there but, a couple of days before I was supposed to come home Texas froze and all flights were canceled. I asked the host for a week extension and in the end they were able to accommodate. However, since the hosts had someone booked after me it took them a couple of days to figure out everything on their end and get back to me. I texted my boyfriend the situation and asked him if I could stay with him since I was desperate. He told me no because his roommate/childhood friend (26m) who also works for the same company as us is a big gossip and that he would tell the entire office about us. I also knew the roommate was a big gossip and that was the only reason as to why I got the airbnb and instead of staying with him.

I was pissed and hurt but I let it go. We got into an argument recently about how I don't think he makes me a priority or appreciates me and I brought this up as one of the examples. He got upset and said that I know that there was nothing he could do and that I was just being being ridiculous and hurtful for bringing it up. I don't think I was being ridiculous and that I had a valid point. AITA?

Edit: His family and close friends do know about me. The roommate only knows that my boyfriend has a long distance girlfriend but not who I am.  Boyfriend has said in the past that he can't trust his roommate with any secrets.

I called my dad and asked him to dig a hole before the ground freezes. I used my brother's cat as a size reference only. I live 2.5 hrs from him and only visit a few times a year. So he hasn't seen my cat in a while. 
Last week, my brother's cat, who had been very healthy, suddenly gets sick. The local vet found nothing however, three days later the cat was struggling to breath. He was rushed to the ER vet and they discovered he was in full blown congestive heart failure with fluid on his lungs. There wasn't anything that could be done.
My brother blames me, saying I jinxed his cat, and now refuses to speak to me."	89	34	0.91

Now one thing about ana is that she is obsessed with her birthday, every year she wantes her birthday to be a day when everyone just does everything the way she likes, she even celebrates birthday month where you are supposed to be good to her the entire month.


 This year we did not have much work so at the starting of theyear shr made a plan of going on a trip for her birthday with our friends. I was in for the trip from the starting and was okay from the start, nothing was finalized but the idea was always seen in a positive light. We generally do not celebrate birthdays THAT extravagantly but this was supposed to be an exception. 


Now her birthday is in around 20 days and a week ago i got to know that the exam that i need to pass for my further studies have been preponed by 2 months, i lost 30percent of my prep time and it is something that is stressing me out alot,it is a very important exam for me and i cant afford to not pass, so i cancelled all of my partying and social obligations including her birthday. 


She got really angry and has given me the ultimatum that she would never talk to meif i wont go, is calling me names, and a bad friend for doing that. 


I understand that she is sad but i think that is a bit extreme, i am firm on my decision to not go, so, AITA for ditching my friend's party plans at the last moment?"	10	45	0.78

My (20sF) father passed away when I was 7. A couple years later, when I was 10, my mom got remarried to my current stepdad. I’ll admit, I was less that ecstatic (to the point where I locked myself in the venue bathroom to cry) but to his face I think I was quite polite. He works in science and I was a super inquisitive kid, so I used to ask him lots of stuff.

He was an alright stepdad. We had family outings twice a month that he’d pay for, and he always got me and my younger brother little gifts whenever he was out.

As I got older I had some personal issues occur and declining mental health (on top of normal teenage angst), so I got quite irritated with him at times but it wasn’t anything particular to him. I honestly got more upset with my mom and other relatives. 

Around 15-16, my stepdad straight up stopped talking to me. He was always quiet but I mean like literally he would not say hello when he walked into a room with me in it. Or if somebody else was there, he’d specifically greet them and ignore me. He’d only communicate with me if my mom told me I have to ask him something or made him do it. Eventually, I just started doing the same back and ignoring him even if we were the only two people in a room.

This continued into present day, where I’m now in my early 20’s. Whenever I came home for college it was still the same, zero acknowledgement unless specifically forced to speak. I got really irritated with it when my brother and I were watching a movie one day and he greeted him and just went upstairs without even looking at me. When I asked my mom about it, she said it’s because when I was 15 I once “told him to stop talking to me” and that I know how weird he can be, and if anything I’m being an AH by not going out of my way to initiate conversation with him and fix things.

There’s other factors that make me not want to talk to him too, like how I once overheard him telling my moms friends that I was abusive because when I was 12 I kicked the back of his car seat when he was driving (???).

I’m obviously biased because to me, It’s ridiculous that he’s holding something I said as an angry teen against me and remembers all these random little things I did. But maybe I just need to get over it and be the bigger person.

So am I the AH here?

Edit: The line about “how weird he can be” was said by my mom, not me"	126	42	0.91

Throwaway because several people I know use Reddit. 

I am a 27 year old transwoman. I came out at fourteen, and over the years I've gotten a wonderful group of friends, just about all of which are LGBT and supportive. It's become a club of sorts, and occasionally we get new members.

It's pretty much customary in our particular circle to introduce ourselves with our pronouns. We have several non-binary members, so this is very important to us.

Recently, a friend of mine introduced a new member, who we'll call D (25, NB). After everyone introduced themselves, D told us their preferred pronouns were it/its.

I immediately got uncomfortable and didn't really refer to them for the rest of the evening. It wasn't that D was unpleasant, in fact they were wonderful and very funny.

I have a little bit of history with being referred to as it, especially since I went through bullying in high school that used it as an insult. So I find it demeaning to refer to myself and other people that way. 

I felt bad for not respecting D's pronouns, so I took them aside and explained the issue I had with their chosen pronouns and asked if they had an alternative I could use. They didn't really give me an answer, just got angry and left. 

Later, the friend that brought D along sent me a message saying that D was very hurt by my refusal to use their pronouns and that they've been talking to other people in my friend group about it.

No one has really made a stink about it, but I'm starting to feel much more guilty about it. AITA?"	7086	1052	0.87

I asked for a chest binder and she basically said no because she thinks they are “Unsafe” and they will “Ruin my body” Even though I told her I have done my research about binding safely and such, She said she has to ask my doctor.

 (Which this added to my anger because she always does this when I try to tell her what I know she just denies it and has to ask a professional every time. Or facebook) 

So maybe a month later after this I keep asking her if she called the doctor, Her response is “I forgot” Or “I’ll do it later” When she has free time and isn’t even doing anything, And when I come back a few hours later and ask again she’ll get mad and say “Just leave me alone” Which made me very angry because I told her how much getting a binder means to me and it feels like she doesn’t even care. 

And she always puts off my opinions and feelings so this isn’t new behavior, So yesterday I asked again and she said she would call them. And surprise surprise! She forgot yet again! Now this time I just exploded on her. She can remember everything else just fine but not me? I understand the being unsure about being transgender but she never respects my pronouns, My new name or anything! And She tells everyone about it without asking if I’m okay with it!

I also get the feedback that i'm good to work with and confident infront of the camera.
There is a known photographer at our university who's always open for collabs.
A friend of mine(21,f) and me were both interested into working with him.
We both texted him and he answered me and told me i was fitting his style. We got to know each other and i'm a really confident extrovert, what made me attractive in his eyes.
But he didn't want to work with my friend. Tbh i see why. Her photography style is completly different then his and you really can see that she's not that confident infront of a camera, being a photographer is more her thing than a model.
Now she's mad at both of us. At him, because the reasons why he wants to work with me are in other words why he probably didn't want to work with her, that she isn't ""attractive enough"" in his eyes him.
And at me,  because he wants to work with me and i still want to shoot with him. I really admire his photography and it's a honor for me to shoot with him. I don't want to decline because of her.

AITA?

Edit: I get that u all are pissed from the attractive part but that's the point she's pissed of. She is pissed that he thinks that i'm attractive. He never gave her a reason why he declined. Also: Nobody said one freaking word about LOOKS, it's all about confidence.
I also tried to be understanding but she's always so annoyed and pissed when that topic is coming up or someone just says his name.

Also: I'm sorry but confidence is key. She is way better to work with as a photographer. But this wasn't a photography job. Everybody has something they are good at and i don't think i am an ass for pointing out that i'm good at modeling because photography &amp; modeling is a passion for me.

For context, he’s a painter, and we’ve had terrible weather so his boss texted last night and said that work today (monday) would be cancelled due to the rain and wind. 

Here’s where it gets frustrating for me.. 
He’s already had two naps today and it’s only 3:30pm, usually i would be okay with him napping on weekends but I said to him that on days where he’s supposed to be working, and isn’t, for whatever reason (unless he’s sick) he should help me with our son because i’m a SAHM 24/7 but he only works 7.5 hours 5 days a week and don’t get me wrong, i know that working full time is difficult, and can be physically draining, but so is staying at home with a baby, especially as i have PPD and also am anaemic (had multiple iron infusions, nothing works) 

i’m so so tired too, but i can’t just take a nap because my son needs me. 

i just feel so alone in this, and he’s the one who wanted a baby, when i found out i was pregnant my first thought was a termination or adoption but he promised that he would support me in parenting and that i wouldn’t be alone. 

He’s mad at me for being upset and telling him i would rather he help out than nap right now as he’s supposed to be working today, but he isn’t.

I (M, 21) am a college student who takes college courses online (way before the pandemic came along) and I watch my autistic sister who's practically a baby, so I'm home almost all the time while my mother works part time for 4 hours from 9am - 1pm.

My neighbors recently moved to another town about 20 minutes away from where I lived. I'm not close with them, but my mother is... kind of. Let's just say that she doesn't really like them per se in a sense that she can't be bothered to try and initiate a convo with them first versus them coming to her first.

Anyway a week ago, the neighbor called my mom and asked if it's okay for me to pick up his 9 y/o daughter from school since he and his wife would still be at work. For a quick rundown, her school is about a 5 minute walk from my house so she knows exactly where to go. No turns, no crossing the street, basically I just have to let her in the house when she knocks at the door. In an hour or two, her 17 y/o brother comes to pick her up.

My mom said yes and told me, well, what I just told you. Although I didn't consent to actually willing to watch his kid, I didn't have a problem with it since by the time she gets to my house, I'm already done with most of my HW and such. The daughter is an angel and usually keeps to herself, so she doesn't give me any trouble.

Now here's the problem: The first day she came by, everything was okay. She wasn't a bother, she stayed to herself, stuck around for an hour or two before her brother picked her up, it was fine.

The next day I didn't get a call from her dad, so my mom and I assumed that it was a one day deal. An hour after my mom settled in, however, I hear knocking at the door. I scrambled to get dress, went to the door, and saw that the daughter was there.

Again, the usual happened: she stuck to herself, did homework, bro picked her up, all is done.

Now, my mom was ANNOYED when this happened. I know she wasn't specifically upset with me, but I can tell she was frustrated. It was almost as if she didn't want the daughter to come over in the first place. She kept telling me, ""Make up an excuse, say you have an exam"".

I was kind of shocked, considering she was the one that didn't even consult to me to see if I was okay with any of this in the first place. I told her, ""Since YOU were the one that said yes, YOU talk to him about it.""

This repeated until eventually yesterday, I had to break the news to her father that I couldn't watch his daughter anymore (for my mother's sake) and he was chill about it. Again, I had no problem watching his kid. My mother, on the other hand, is upset with me that I placed the blame on her and called me selfish for not taking responsibility even though I wasn't bothered.

So... AITA for telling my mom it's her fault I had to watch our neighbor's kid?"	77	12	0.89

Apologies for the formatting  I’m on mobile  




I(f18) have a best friend J(f18) and she has a little sister (12). I’ve been best friends with  J for almost 8 years now and have met and spoken to her sister quite a lot as a result of that. She’s bit of a geek and is into anime and manga, knowing that I share the same interests are her she would come and sit with me to talk about her favorite shows and characters. About a month ago J texted me asking if it was okay to give V my Instagram, as she had just set up an account and wanted to talk to me about anime. I told her that I didn’t mind and to go ahead and give her my @. V started texting me almost immediately after I accepted her request and she was just super excited to talk to me since I’m the only person she knows who shares her interests. Soon enough the texting about anime turned into her telling me about her day in school and asking for advice on issues with her friends. I found it strange that she was asking me for this as J is by no means a bad sister and she’s very protective over V but I just chalked it up to pre-teen angst and payed it no mind. I have a little sister myself so none of this was new to me. Now to where the concerning behavior started, a few days ago she texted me complaining about a stomach ache, I asked her if she’d eaten anything bad and she said no, I told to tell to me what she had at school in case of it being poisoning from the school food and she said she didn’t have anything at school. I asked her to elaborate and she gave me a rundown on what what she eats on a normal day. I added it up and it’s barely a 1000 calories. She’s a growing girl and needs the calories to Stay health so I gave her some advice and told her to maybe eat more calorie dense food if she felt her stomach couldn’t hold down more food than she was actually eating, that way she’s still be getting the calories in and not getting weak. I don’t know if this is this anything serious but as a person who used to have an earring disorder it’s been gnawing  away at my brain. Part of me really wants to tell her, but I’m also afraid that if this is in fact an eating disorder and word got back to V that I told she might not talk to me again and effectively alienate herself from her family and that would be incredibly very detrimental to her mental health."	6	8	0.74

Continuing on his current path will help set him up in his career in a massive way. I’ve been extremely supportive of this move ever since he asked his boss if this was a potential, and we were both extremely excited when he got the opportunity. We’ve had discussions previous to this move even being an idea and had come to the understanding that we knew there would be times we’d be long distance for our careers. For history, we’ve been together for over 5 years and lives together for 3 until this move. 


Now that he’s in a different country, he’s struggling to adjust, and it frustrates me. I personally don’t think he’s given the opportunity a chance (he only just moved into his apartment) and believe if he allowed himself fo settle he’ll be able to make the most of it. His emotions also flip every other week. One week, it’s the best decision in the world, the next he’s telling me he’s booking a flight home. 


The distance is already hard enough, but it makes me angry that he seems like he’s just giving up. I’m worried about all the fall out as well if he does move home - things will be different if he moves home between us (disappointment and frustration vs possible resentment), and he’ll have to pay his company back all the money they spent moving him over there. He wouldn’t have a job to come back to either. He’d come home jobless and depressed. I’ve got my own busy career and don’t have the time energy or mental capacity to take care of him. I know it’s not fair of me but I just want him to get over himself. 


Recently I know I have not been able to mentally support him through these lows, and it’s been making me more blunt with my communication, even mean and I know it’s not ok so I try to pull back communication but that just makes things worse. And then when I do talk to him he just gets more upset. I just don’t know what to do. I don’t think it’s time for him to move back. I won’t eat to live with him if he does.

Our relationship was pretty serious pretty young! 

To start it all off I want to give a back story! My husband got together when he and his mom moved into the apartment next to me and my parents!  
We ended starting to date and a few months into the relationship I found out I was pregnant. Yes 16 and pregnant! That’s how my husband and I got our 1st son. This is where I start with my mother in law. She wanted an abortion when I 1st found out. I didn’t agree with her and went on. Then she try to set up adoption parent for my unborn child. Which I didn’t agree with. Then I went into labor and she convince my boyfriend that our baby wasn’t his. He believed her at the time. She is what I call narcissistic. Well I had my son time went on and we had no Contact with my son dad or anyone in his family! 
Fast forward a couple months my sons showed to my work saying he was kick out his mother house and he thinks it was sign for to be part of our sons life. He still wanted a DNA test which I didn’t care cause he was the dad. We got back together and had no contact at all with his mother for a year! 

He joined the army  him and his mom where on good terms and  she did ask about my son if it was really his and he said. “yes we had a DNA test done!”After that we end up renting a room from her. He and I thought It was best for our son if got married But before we got married me and him were not on the same page he kept me in dark and was always fucking around with others. So I felt that he was just gonna marry me cause we had our son not because he want me. So I had an online affair that only got as far one boob picture snd lasted a week! I never told anyone but for some reason I felt that his mom was a friend and told her that only was talking to someone and she told me to say anything to My fiancé at the time. 
Time goes on and my mother in law start to cause problems with me. But this time it’s with my son. She would convince my 2 year old at the time that i was  “ A bad mommy”.  Living there turned my sweet baby be so rude to me it hurt my heart! My husband got out of basic and we moved out at this point I was ready. At this point she was tracking my location anywhere I went like I could go see my mom for more that 2 hrs without her calling me. I think she had control of me cause she knew my secret. 
My son and I went to meet my husband where he was stationed and a month and half of living there we found I 4 weeks pregnant. And we were excited this baby was planned. No one knew that beside me and husband! We didn’t go back home for a year. We got live our life with just us. There is where we found our love again.

We went back home for Christmas in 2020 for my 2nd second Christmas. We spent Christmas Eve at my mother in laws house and she end causing drama between my sister-in-law and I! Little did she know me and her are best friends and tell and talk about everything. We caught her in lies. And we where nice to her but we didn’t act fake and be her friend this time. She was upset with this! That after a week she told my husband that I was screwing someone else. 

Her saying that open up my secret and I came clean about the boob picture. We fought for months about it. Almost got divorced but me and talked out our problems and now I feel we are the best stop ever.  He hasn’t the best relationship with his mother since.

Now it’s 2021 in November and now she trying to start more. By telling my sister in law that my second son isn’t my husbands. My sister in law of course tell me . That’s when I had it. My 1st or my second sons aren’t your sons? Unless a DNA test I guess. So I tell my husband because honestly I knew I would petty if I took care of it. He call her and confronts her! She lied and said she would never say anything like that! So my husband calls his brother cause he was there when she said it my sister in law! His brother said yes she said that your 2nd isn’t yours. And then says that for his brother cause their own problem with her and let’s say they also do talk this also when my husband cut his mom off both our kids and him.
 
It’s now almost Christmas time. And I get a message from my mother in laws mommy. Telling me that I need to get over it so their family can be whole again. All I said was my husband is a big boy . I’m not keeping him from his mom.  I am respecting myself by not surrounding my self with people that respect me or my kids. 
So my question am I the asshole for keeping my children away from my mother in law?"	2	2	0.55

That is when I replied that her teacher would be right because she hadn't really tried anything and she was content to say that the platform was useless.

My sister immediately got defensive because I added that there were emails and WhatsApp

She replied that she did not know what her teacher's were.

And I rebutted that these data are on the platform or that she could have asked any classmate or teacher

She went on to say that the only problem was that the platform did not support her video file.

I replied that he should have expected it, because our school platform cannot load files that are too large like yours.

She replied that hers only lasted one minute and 26 seconds and that the same teacher had asked for the one minute video

Finally, I answered  that 26 seconds extras make a difference.  Her teacher asked her for only one minute, knowing that the platform only supports one minute.

My sister no longer responded so I thought that she had realized that it was her fault, so I added that if she had dedicated herself to doing the activities at the indicated time she would not be so worried and would have had time to solve any problem . So now instead of complaining and victimizing herself she should focus on doing all the pending and approving. I told her all that without looking at her because I was looking at my food, but when I looked up she had tears and leave the dining room, leaving myself surprised by her reaction. Then I felt really guilty 

Three hours later I found her arguing with Mom because she had already found out about all her pending activities, my sister's attitude and her responses were quite offensive

I got upset again and i told him that that she was the last person who could be angry, because she was irresponsible and that was the reality that she had to accept and overcome. I finished saying not to waste time and solve their problems, if they needed help I would be there but I was not going to apologize.

There were no more answers so I went back to my chores but I have noticed that although my sister doesn't seem upset anymore, she seems quite discouraged and she avoids talking to me or my mom.

My (maternal) great-grandmother was born to Jewish parents in 1939. They fled to England shortly after WW2 started, and were granted refugee status in the US in 1942. They became US Citizens, and raised the rest of their children in the United States. My great-grandmother never practiced Judaism. She married a (ethnically)  Jewish man in the 60s, and had my mom's mom. My grandma never grew up with Rosh Hashana, or Passover,  or Hanukkah, because my great-grandparents wanted to better integrate with American (aka white) culture. I don't know the specifics of my (maternal) grandfather's heritage, but he had a Ashkenazi last name (Fink) and had stereotypical jewish features. He was never in my mom's life, but she inherited many of those same features, some from her mom (almost 100% ethnically Jewish) and her dad (at least 50% Jewish [his mom was Welsh, I do know that]) 

So my mom is about 75% Jewish, and 25% Welsh. My dad is Irish and Scottish. My mom has brown hair and brown eyes, my dad has Black hair and green eyes. I have brown hair and green eyes.

(TL;DR: My mom is ethnically Jewish, my dad is Irish. I am at least half Jewish, though I have a lot of my dad's features)

I grew up celebrating Christmas, because both my parents did. They're die-hard baptists, and I'm agnostic, though I've been pondering going in depth of my Jewish roots. I was talking to a group of my friends the other day, and we were telling stories from our jobs.

I work retail (think Ross or Burlington) and I'm a greeter. This time of year, I will cheerily wave customers out the door with a ""Happy Holidays!"" Once, some d-bag turned around and said ""Just say Merry Christmas"" and I responded with ""I'm Jewish."" The guy walked away sheepishly, and I thought it was a funny story.

As I was telling my friends this, one of them said it was kind of a dick move for me to imply that I'm religiously Jewish when I'm not. I said it was OK because I'm ethnically Jewish, and he was being an asshole. A lot of my friends agreed with me, but many agreed with my friend, saying that since I was raised Christian, I can't say ""Well I'm a Jew"" to people who don't know the difference between the ethnicity and the religion. My friend directly said ""You're just being offensive to real Jews. You know, the ones who would have died in the Holocaust.""

We got into a big argument because of that, her saying that I wasn't Jewish enough, and me trying to explain that my Grandma actually fled from the Nazi regime. She said that I would have been fine because I look like my dad, but I'm also queer and although I don't look stereotypically Jewish, you can still tell. 

Am I the asshole in this situation?"	7	36	0.64

Anyways Christmas came and I got gifts for everyone I spent quite a bit. I don't really get along with her so I just got some expensive bag.

I gave it to her and she took it and didn't even say thank you or anything. She saw the bag and laughed why did you get me a fake. I said it's not fake. Then all the questions came. 
 
How did you afford this? I said it doesn't matter just say thank you and leave it. She kept going on and on. Saying how can someone that works in a bar afford this.

Everyone else were very surprised when I gave them gifts and some said omg I can't take this. Her lil bro cried cuz I got him a ps5 I love that lil dude.

Anyways it came to a head when I just snapped I said enough if your going to wreck my head of how I could afford it and not even show any gratitude I'm taking it back. She looked shocked. I just took the box from the sofa and locked it in my car. It was quite awkward after that so I left shortly.

My gf said that I understand but would like for me to apologize to her mother for snapping at her but she agrees she doesn't deserve the present.

I have house/pet sit for her frequently for around 2.5 years and never been paid to do so (and never offered), I didn’t mind as I considered her to be a sister, and it was nice to have some time away from my family. 

I have known her for 10 years when she was just graduated from college and I was in middle school. I met her through my mom, who treated her as a friend and “adoptive daughter”. When we met she was at the stage I am at now, just out of college and relatively broke, and my parents would pay for her to go out to eat with us frequently. They didn’t mind as they knew she couldn’t afford going out all the time. Now I work at Starbucks and make minimum wage and she is a nurse that gets paid very well. She is constantly traveling and recently stayed in hotels costing ~$400 a night. 

I originally started house sitting for her in the summers when I was home from college, eventually I got a job and chose to commute from her place. My work is about halfway between so the distance didn’t make a difference.
She said I could eat anything they had at home but they never had any food. I asked once for her to stock their house before they left and she bought some snacks for me but never did so since. It is stressful for me to grocery shop when there because there is no parking in the city, and grocery stores are decently far if you want to walk. I also am too anxious to walk around most of the time because it does not feel safe and I have been approached.

When I first started house sitting for her I would park in the 1 guest spot her building had in the back alley. Recently, I would have to leave around 3-4 am when it was dark to commute, I asked her to get me access to their garage which she did so. 

This past time I stayed there I had my boyfriend come stay with me which was nice because it made me feel more safe. At the time my boyfriend didn’t have a car, but ended up buying one. I let him park in the garage since his car is new, and I parked in the 1 guest spot in the alley. He was only going to stay 1 more night and then leave, so my car would only be in the spot for 1 day. There are no signs saying not to park there and I have parked there for years, including overnight and never had problems. She also did not tell me I could no longer park there. The next day my car had been towed. I texted her asking her about it and she said it was for short term parking (news to me). When I got my car back and told her the tow cost me $400 she said “live and learn”.

That really hurt. I thought as someone I considered a sister she would be a little more compassionate. All I wanted was snacks, gas money, and maybe to split the tow. Is my sense of house sitting etiquette wrong? AITA for stopping responding to her and just mailing her her keys?"	0	43	0.5

the teasing specifically is about a boy i had attended first grade with and was rather rude to me, in which my parents teased about it being that he had a crush on me (this had been going on for long enough that i had forgotten the reason why the teasing had begun). every week or so, he is mentioned at least once and i am teased about it throughout the night. my family will mention things like 'oh he might be going to your college, you should go on a date with him if so' or 'let's see what he's up to nowadays and see if you can get in contact with him' and then look up his facebook, insta, the like. every time the boy's name is mentioned i become upset and closed off because i can't stand the teasing and the fact that it's never stopped despite how many times throughout the years i've asked for it to.

it all blew up recently when i angrily expressed that it was something that made me uncomfortable as it's been about 12 years since then and the teasing is still as alive as ever. my mom had told me that i'm choosing to be uncomfortable and that i'm ruining the fun for everyone by acting childish. the only one that chose to take my side was my younger brother (16), as he expressed that he'd be just as uncomfortable in my situation, especially since he's had girls being rude to him throughout his school years as well and he's never teased about that or about the girls liking him. but when he said this, it was like it was in one ear and out the other with everyone else.

We work in construction design and have a project with a major fast food chain that she’s stopped caring about when it’s literally 95% done. It’s important that we finish this project and get paid for it as it’s the most money we’ve signed into since the pandemic started.

The thing is, May started her own company that’s a direct competitor to ours about 4-5 months ago. All of her attention, time, and effort has been going into this company while she slacks off here. I can’t blame her because she’s asked for a raise, vacation days, etc and hasn’t received a thing after 3 years of working here.

I have been very supportive to her since the beginning, not saying a word to our bosses and covering for her whenever she’s “out sick” (in reality she’s taking meetings with her personal clients). In return, May watches my dog for me while I’m in class and often buys me lunch for “being a good friend”. 

But now my boss comes to me asking why May is out sick again, what time did she work this day and that day, did she even show up on x day? And I hate lying to him because he’s been nothing but supportive of me as I’m taking time off during work hours to finish my degree - time that I still get paid for because I’m salary. 

I feel stuck in the middle of this drama and like I’m playing both sides but I don’t want any part of it. I’m scared to say anything in case I get labeled as the office tattle tale, or talked down to/about between the rest of the male dominated workplace. I don’t want anyone to not trust me with confidential information but I also don’t want the burden of keeping anything from my supervisors.

Our original plan was to meet for dinner and go home, but that turned into dinner, drinks, then going back to their house, many more drinks and then we spent the night. 

Bf’s sister offered me a pair of sweatpants and a shirt to sleep in, and before we left I changed back into my own clothes, putting hers in her laundry bin.

Carly and I have been living together since 2019, but Amy just moved in this past August. We’ve been having some issues with Amy lately, due to her breaking some house rules and being generally very messy. We’ve tried having roommate talks over these issues but they haven’t really gone anywhere. Recently, I had a fairly big conflict with Amy due to her breaking a major house rule of no drinking in the apartment and trashing the place, leaving it for me to clean up. She’s spent 90% of her time away from the apartment in the two weeks since then, so there hasn’t been much interaction between us to judge how things are right now. I’m only mentioning this because I don’t know if the issue of this post would seem like a further petty jab at her after the conflict.

One major issue of her messiness is that she leaves coffee grounds EVERYWHERE in the common area. Both Carly and I don’t really drink coffee often, but we had a Keurig prior to Amy moving in. Since then, she’s been the main one using it, and she got reusable K-Cups to use with Folgers coffee (in the big red containers.) Since the coffee is loose grounds, it can get messy and she just doesn’t clean it no matter how often we ask, and I’m tired of stepping in dried coffee grounds and finding them places they shouldn’t be (such as in the stove). I’m at the point where I just want to tell her that unless she starts cleaning up the coffee grounds, she needs to get the single use K-cup pods since those don’t make a mess. I feel like I might be an asshole if I do that since she drinks a lot of coffee, at least 3-4 cups a day, and she uses Folgers to cut costs, but I can’t handle the mess anymore.

I told her it’d be super fun to share a fun experience together, like a painting or cooking class. She ended up going with an escape room - which my partner and I absolutely love - so we were thrilled and excitedly looking forward to it!

Fast forward to the beginning of January, my friend sent my partner and I a group text message saying she’d be booking the escape room on Sunday, January 23rd. The three of us agreed that day worked for our schedules, so planning a local escape room experience would be perfect. We also discuss booking for a group of 3 or booking the entire room to reduce any COVID-related risks. My friend even asks if I’d like to invite any of our mutual friends. So far, she has been very inclusive of our preferences and opinion for this very generous gift. 

My friend then says she’s booking it in a city about 2.5 hours away. My partner and I discuss it with each other and decide that 5 hours worth of round trip driving to visit the same escape room we have locally isn’t going to work for us. When we initially gave our availability, it was based on the assumption that the event would occur locally. My partner has every Sunday off except for the last Sunday of the month. So he has a good amount of things he’d like to get done on the last day before he works 14 days straight. 

I ask my friend in our group chat if we can book the escape room locally (since it’s the same company/brand and prices) and that is when things go awry. 

As soon as I ask about booking locally, she accuses me of trying to take control of the gift. I try to explain that we have other things we need to do that Sunday and can’t commit all of our time to the event, which now includes the escape room, 5 hours of driving, and eating out. She then tries to explain her response by drawing a parallel to any gift she’s received from us. She says that any time she’s ever been gifted makeup, clothes, perfume, purses, etc., she’s never asked us to return one so she could get something she liked more - and she expected us to receive the gift in the same manner, accepting and attending regardless of how the travel would affect us. I was completely floored by this response and didn’t even know how to respond. I eventually told her to plan it for the farther city and let us know what she wanted to do. 

And when the day finally came, we never went. When I asked her why, she said she was waiting for us to choose where we wanted to go and said I was an as*hole for trying to control the gift and take away her say in where it would be done.

Also this is written on mobile so if there are any formatting issues, my bad. 

It’s not an extravagant story but I’ll do my best to explain thoroughly. I (25F) live with my parents (50s and working) and younger sister (20, in school and not working).

Anyway, my parents were paying for a Netflix subscription for a while and everyone in the house used it. It was the base package (at the time, I’m not sure if things have changed since then) that came with two screens and didn’t offer the 4K services. Since I have the smart TV and was also logged in at my boyfriend’s house (he has the one that’s a few upgrades from my own), I asked if I could upgrade to the higher package for four screens and the 4K services and in exchange, I would pay for the bill monthly (it’s still under my mum’s email). My parents agreed and here we are now. 

I have an older half sister (“Ashley”, 30F) that is married, has a toddler and lives in her husband’s (“Ken”, 32M) rented condo. Things have been rocky since she brought him home a few years ago unexpectedly, announcing that she was pregnant and they were getting married beforehand. Ashley had never mentioned she was seeing anyone so it was quite a surprise, but we accepted Ken and tried out best to get to know him. He’s super reserved but they came over a few times. Things only became a problem as of a few months ago and Ashley basically disowned us. I won’t go into details because honestly I’m still confused myself but yea, we don’t talk anymore.

Here’s my problem: my mom came into my room a while back and asked who had access to the account because she got an email from Netflix saying someone had logged in during the early hours of the morning. After listing the household and my boyfriend, we figured it was probably Ashley. It wouldn’t be all that surprising considering they have a young kid, but even if it wasn’t them, I realized that she still has access to the account that I pay for and she doesn’t even talk to us anymore. I said out loud I should change the password but my mom told me to let it go. I can’t forgive her after what she put our parents through. She called them shitty names the last time she came over and they haven’t seen their grandchild in like, six months. She’s been NC for months and hasn’t even said why. Ken is no help. 

WIBTA if I changed the password? 

Why I might be the AH: She’s my sister after all and I’m pretty sure they don’t have cable because they’re trying to cut back on spending to buy a house so they watch TV from a laptop connected to a projector. I think I would feel bad all things considered."	11	41	0.87

Everyone mentioned is 21/22 and we all go to the same college. 

Ok so one of my roommates (Josh) has a girlfriend, who he’s been dating for the past 9 months or so (Hayden) but he used to be with another girl (Kayla). Josh and Kayla were together for about 2 months from around August-October in 2020. I knew Kayla before her and Josh even got together as we have several classes together and became friends that way. I don’t know exactly why they broke up but I know it was Josh who ended it. Then a few months after, he started dating Hayden, who he has been with ever since. Recently, Hayden and Josh’s relationship has come under strain because Hayden doesn’t trust Josh. I’m closer with Josh (because we live together) and he maintains that he has never cheated on Hayden, and has blocked/ stopped talking to girls who Hayden felt threatened their relationship, but she still remains incredibly suspicious. It’s also important to mention that Hayden has never really liked me (not sure why but she’s always very cold to me). 

Anyway that’s the context. The issue is that there is a party (at our apartment) in a couple of weeks that I have invited Kayla to. Josh himself doesn’t have a problem with this, but Hayden is also invited and is significantly pissed off at me for it and has said she does not want Kayla there. I’ve also said that Kayla can stay the night in my room (I mostly sleep in my bfs room, who also lives with us) as she is driving to get here (she is currently out of state and lives about an hour’s drive away) which is what makes it worse, as Josh and Hayden will also be spending the night here. However, it’s not like they have to spend time with each other (there will be like 50 other people here). I personally don’t understand how Hayden can reasonably be demanding that Kayla cannot come because she and Josh dated for about 2 months, over a year ago, and I knew Kayla before that anyway. It’s not like I’ve thought to myself ‘hey let’s invite Josh’s ex to antagonise Hayden.’ Moreover, Kayla has long since moved on (I don’t think their relationship was particularly serious considering it only lasted 2 months anyway) and is currently seeing someone else. Everyone we’re living with is on my side and thinks I can invite anyone I want. So reddit, AITA?"	15	20	0.94

I know I am. I regret every second of it.	https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/swfioa/aita_i_know_i_am_i_regret_every_second_of_it/	"Right. So. Here I am. On what is probably the worst day ever out of my 14 year life.
So what happened? Well, before I start, I need you to know that most of my friends are female. I myself am male. And I am a gossip. I consider it my worst characteristic. I also live in Belgium. But anyways...

So the other day I am talking with a group of people in my class. I believe according to the US school system, I am in 9th grade. As I was talking to them, I mention a friend of mine who has recently changed schools. They know him, and apparantly his nickname was Broccoli. So I laugh, and that is that. Some of these people I would become quite close friends with as the year passed. This was the first class that was nice in my entire life, I had always been bullied until this year. Today, I find myself on the scouts. With Broccoli. And I tell him, in what I percieved as a joking manner:
'Oh hey, Broccoli!'
Him: huh?
Me:'thats the nickname X and X gave you, didn't you know?'
Him: *half shocked expression* 'uhm, no?'
Me:'oh'
So that was that. He seemed shocked.
Come to find out he sent one of the  friends a bad message about the nickname. We'll call her Julia.

Julia: What the fuck you snitch?
Me: huh?
Julia: Broccoli?
Me: oh what about him?
Julia: When we joke abput other people you shouldn't be telling them!
Me: Oh i'm sorry I thought he knew...
Julia: And not only that what you said about me at r.e. This is not acceptable.
Me: (I swear to god I do not remember anythung I said wrong about her) what?
Julia: You said I was a small child?
Me: huh? (It has been about 4 hours, and I still don't know what she means)
Julia: yeah sure.
20 mins later
Me: im serious, Julia, i have no idea.
Julia?
Well
My sincerest apolygies, what I said to him was a mistake, but I don't know about the other thing.
Julia: I said you this and you just tell it on.
Me: look im sorry.
Julia: I don't get anything out of that!
Me: well I hope we can remain friends.
Julia: I think you understand that after this you are no longer welcome.
I am not the only one who feels this way.
So, thats how i lost 7 friends in the blink of an eye.
Make up your mind. I feel terrible. It doesn't matter what good I might have been before, I see myself as a POS now."	0	24	0.4

I ended up having to quit my old job due to running out of FMLA.

In the last couple of weeks, I really haven't appreciated his attitude.  He's been getting shorter with me when asking questions and when trying to coach him on how to do things correctly.  Usually I would say something like ""Hey!  You forgot to pay me back that $10 I lent you!"" and he would just say ""Woops, sorry about that!""  And send me the money on cashapp or paypal.

He did just start a new work-from-home job in December, and they just started something he calls the ""Quarterly Software Deployment"" which is apparently a huge thing?

Well, he's been responding more shortly to my inquiries.  I ask him if he took the trash out, or if he remembered X or Y and he'll just say ""Okay"" incredibly dully and then do the task in silence.  I'm used to a more upbeat response and I'm starting to feel like a burden with these short responses.

It all comes to a head this morning when I noticed my ice cream was in the refrigerator and fully melted.  I told him he could have a bowl earlier in the day and it seems he put it in the wrong place.  I talked to him in his office and let him know he needs to be more careful and I asked when he will be going out to get more ice cream.

Oh boy, he BLEW up on me.  I've never seen him like this before; he started crying and screaming (not at me directly, just in general) and said something like ""Just take my debit card and GET YOURSELF SOME MORE ICE CREAM!  GET YOURSELF A NEW FERRARI IF YOU WANT TOO.  JUST TAKE IT!""

I was scared and drove off to cool down.  I sent him a text letting him know I expect an apology.  AITA?

This might also be relevant, but he told me three weeks ago he's withdrawing from something called ""Lexo""?  I think that's what it was called?  It's something his psychiatrist prescribed and he had to go off of it for a while since he was fired from his old job and lost his insurance.  Regardless, that was a while ago.  


**Edit: Regarding his medicine. He lost his job and insurance abruptly. We had so much other debt, we decided to make do with what we had. There are some important medicines that I need for my disability; we prioritized getting me my medication during the insurance lapse.**"	6563	3077	0.87

I was the smart one and she was the pretty one. I always hated these nicknames and it ruined my confidence for a very long time but my sister always encouraged it (which is insane because she was/is incredibly smart). 

People also already “knew” what our futures looked like. I was the independent successful lawyer or doctor and she was the mom+housewife married to a rich man. Again, my sister was more than happy with this while I hated it. Again, I’m not judging either futures but it just felt so restricting.

I felt a lot of resentment towards everybody and went low contact when I left for college. 

There I wasn’t just “smart” anymore and I found my style, made a lot of friends and got a degree in the arts lmao. I also met my bf (now husband). 

Something else that I wasn’t “supposed” to have was children. My sister was going to be the mom and even though I always wanted kids and was great with them, I had some health issues so I was automatically infertile in my parents eyes. 

Well. I have a few kids and am pregnant with most likely my last. They’re all boys. My parents switched up when my eldest was born and now support my life choices. They’ve also stopped treating my sister as the “pretty” one but as a normal human with different sides to her. 

Anyways my sister and I were talking and she was complaining about how her life was going nowhere. She talked about how nothing in her life was stable except her job. She then made a comment about how in a perfect world she would be me and I would be her. She made some comments about how my kids would be cuter with her features and even said that she looks better with my husband. The final straw(?) was when she asked if I could give her the son I’m expecting. 

Now, just to be clear, she said this in a joking way but I was extremely upset. I told her multiple times that I don’t like it when she talks about what our lives were supposed to look like but she mentions it at least once every time we meet. I usually just try to change topics but the thing she said about my husband and children made me extremely uncomfortable so I snapped and told her to grow tf up already. She was taken aback because she was just joking and that I’m being a huge drama queen. She told me that I was a hypocrite and that I needed to grow up because her casually reminiscing about our childhood should not make me act so bitchy.

I don’t think I’m the AH at all actually but she insists I am and my parents think I’m being dramatic as well. AITA?"	45	26	0.85

They recently went for a staycation where they book a hotel room together.
Initially i wasn’t very comfortable but because she had already paid for the accommodations so i didn’t want to affect her plans and just asked her to enjoy. After their short staycation i saw she posted a tik tok video of them together while they were having fun but it left me weird after seeing the video as there were just pics and solo vids of the guy only and the vid talks about how they became work friends to best friends. I initially didn’t think about it but being the overthinker i am, i also realise that they have been texting 1-1 more often and that some of our tik toks vids that we did together and Instagram post were removed from her account. Now this left me really upset and I decided to confront her.
When i told her about this she just explained that the video was talking about their friendship including the girl that was with them and not specifically just the guy and also why she removed the tik tok vids and pics of us from Instagram was because “its just a girls thing”. I told her i needed some time alone and i didn’t want to meet her today after what she shared with me.

We spoke on the phone before he went, and he said he was going to swing by the cousins house to pick up something and be home in 30 mins.
Husband often underestimates the time, so I figured at least 45-60mins. I texted him. No reply. Sent a snapchat later. No reply. 2.5hrs later, I'm WORRIED. I'm panicking hoping he's okay and not hurt. I called. At the last ring he answered and laughingly says, ""I'm still at the cousins house"". I was furious and said, ""you didn't think to let me know?"" And hung up. 
He called 20 mins later, assuming he left, but I didn't answer. When he got home, he said his phone was 1% and that cousin kept insisting to stay longer, so that's why he got late. 
I'm waiting since the last 3 hrs for him to come home. And this isn't the first time its happened. This is a regular occurrence since the last 1 year. And I get it, during the day he has a lot of work calls. So phone can get discharged and he won't be able to communicate. I got him a portable charger for this reason. Yet still he's not responsible enough to use such tools, to never be in a situation that, ""my phone was 1% so I couldn't call to let you know where I am so you don't get worried or anxious.""

He had two children with a girlfriend back then, he got out of that life and help to kick his addictions but she never did. He and I (41f) met years later and got together eventually having a daughter (7f).

His ex-girlfriend lost custody of their children (15m) and (12m) five months ago and they are now living with us. It has been a rocky time and not easy, the boys didn't have a stable home life and my husband was fighting for years to get custody of them to try and change that, the boys have struggled to settle which is understandable as it's a big change and our home is very different from what they're used to. I'd never speak ill of their mother in front of them but lets just say she wasn't exactly a stable parent. 

They are constantly acting out, being sullen, disruptive, and often getting into fights at school. I've been as patient and supportive as I can be and have even spoken to my husband about the five of us going for family therapy together to help us all but he is hesitant to do that and insists they just need time to settle. Despite this behaviour though they are very protective of their little sister and my daughter follows them around like a duckling. 

Sometimes though that means she gets dragged into their mischief or causes some of their own, she's not a little angel I know that and can cause plenty of trouble herself. Today while the three of them were playing in the back garden a rock smashed our kitchen window which meant it had to come from the garden and one of them, when I questioned them on who did it though the three of them were quiet and wouldn't tell on whoever did it. So it was either my daughter or one of my step-sons, I felt I couldn't play favourites or treat them unequally as I had no clue which of the three did it so I sent them to their rooms telling them they were grounded for the rest of the week and until the window was paid off all three of their pocket money was being docked equally. 

I then sent them to their rooms while I cleaned up the broken glass and covered the window. When my Husband got home I told him what had happened, he told me I should have just waited until he came home and left it to him and that I really shouldn't be punishing the boys, now I got a bit annoyed at this, I work from home so i'm around them more often which means I often have to be the one laying ground rules down and I also treated them equally and I don't think I was too harsh. My husband feels though that he should be the one handling this but what am I supposed to do when he's at work? I know he carries a lot of guilt over the fact he didn't get custody of the boys sooner and is willing to go easier on them because of this and I am for that but there is a point we have to be firm I feel and set ground rules and I think smashing a window is that regardless of if it was them or our daughter. Am I the asshole?

Edit: to fix spacing as it was weird.

Edit 2: people curious about the allowances, they each get £20 a week. I docked it to £10 a week instead as I don't want to leave them with nothing at all."	370	166	0.94

I (F29) have been living in my house (renting) since January 2019 My roommate (F27) moved in in March of 2020, our household has a total of five people. She has a Jack russel that she adopted from a shelter as an adult. He has not been house trained and has a “marking” problem, which isn’t her fault since she got him that way, but she has put zero effort into training him. 

Every couple of weeks the carpets in the living and dining room become so saturated with pee that it’s the first thing we smell when we walk in the door. She’ll only clean it if someone brings it up or if she happens to see a wet spot. I steam clean the carpets once a month (because she won’t do it often enough) because the stench is so unpleasant, and then weeks later it’s back to being covered in pee again. I can’t even sit in my living room and enjoy coffee without stepping in or smelling pee. 

He also jumps up on the dining room table and pees on anything that’s on there, mail, napkins, anything. It happens multiple times a month where we’ll be eating and notice dried crystallized piss on the table. This has happened upwards of 30+ times now. At this point she agreed to keep the dog in her room when she’s not home because he only does this when unsupervised, but as soon as she gets home she lets him out and she stays in her room and doesn’t watch him. She’s so sensitive about it that she takes it as a personal attack anytime I mention how fed up I am about it or tell her about a fresh piss stain. 

WIBTA if I asked her to move? She doesn’t stick to any solution and talks about training him but never actually does. I don’t want to get the landlord involved, but I can. It’s unfair that the other roommates and I have to live in a piss filled household. It’s unhygienic and we’re tired of the constant loop where we tell her about it and nothing gets done.

We’re roughly just 7-8 feet apart (if that) and she unfortunately has a problem with snoring. My concern, however, is I think she might have sleep apnea, because the snoring is louder than average snoring and she’ll stop breathing and almost choke herself awake. She complains about being tired in the mornings (will stay in bed super late every morning) and will nap consistently throughout the day sometimes and from what I’ve heard in other peoples’ experience “diagnosing” those around them, those all line up with apnea. I recorded a few clips through out the night one night just so I could play them for her, but I did it so that she can decide whether or not she thinks she might need/want help. Even though the concern I express for her is genuine, she got so upset when I mentioned it to her, and she kept telling me she can’t help it and that if it bothers me so much I can just wear my airpods or even get ear plugs if need be. it happens on a near daily basis and im unfortunately a light sleeper so if im not asleep before her, slim chance i sleep that night. i can’t afford noise-cancelling airpods and ear plugs are not enough &amp; uncomfortable to sleep in, as much as i want them to work so I can avoid upsetting my roommate again. I just wanted to make sure that there is nothing actually wrong with her sleeping, as apnea can become really serious if not treated or left ignored. But of course, im not a sleep specialist, and i guess it really isn’t my place to say. AITA?	15	12	0.81

I graduated with 2 degrees and high school with zero attendance from any family member any. Hockey games, volleyball, and extracurriculars happened with zero family. I got pitiful looks from attendees that hurt even more. Then witnessing my family make the distance for every other thing my brother does... I just quit them entirely.

Also, my brother and I don't have the best relationship either. He has said awful things about me I don't like to repeat.

For the trip back a guy messaged me on the app, asking if he could transfer me the money instead of paying cash because he had lost his wallet and phone and had to travel to get new documents. I said it was fine as long as he sent me back a screenshot of the $10 payment confirmation. He did that and I picked him up and drove him to the other city. I have to note that I found it weird that he said he had lost his phone, since the number I texted was connected to the app and it is impossible to change it without making a new account. 

By Wednesday, I had still not received the money so I texted him. He said that the bank cancelled his payment because of his lost wallet and that he would ask a friend to send it to me. The day after, on Thursday, he texted me again saying that the friend sent the money and that it would arrive on Monday because it was being sent from a foreign account. I told him it was fine and that I would wait.

Monday came, no money arrived, and then he texted me that the money went through that day because of an issue with the bank. I asked him if it would arrive by tomorrow and got no response. I waited until the next day and, since the transfer did not arrive, I went on the carpooling app and gave him a bad rating. I said that the ride was okay, but that he did not pay for eight days and that his excuses were not believable. He had not seen the rating yet, so he texted me saying that the money finally went through today and would take 1-5 days to arrive. He also asked me if we could meet in person for him to give me the money and that I could send him the transfer back when it arrives.

After telling him that I posted the rating already, I told him that there would be no need to meet and that, if the money arrived, I would contact support to delete the rating so it would not harm his overall rating. He got upset and argued that he would not make such a scene over just 10 dollars and that he would send an additional $10 from his new card today and that I could keep the $20 total and that I was very rude.

AITA here? Should I have waited for a few more days before posting the rating? I am also not sure if I can delete it by contacting support, so maybe I did not think it through well enough?"	16	8	0.9

They run the whole gamut, most of what you can think of in terms of „alternate science, question the herd“ whackadoodelry. They are also super fundamentalist Christians. These last few years have been particularly bad and their views have gone beyond what I’m willing to tolerate because of shared genetics. I’ve basically entirely cut off that side of my family.

My parents still engage with them. My mother out of politeness and niceness, my father because their views make him too angry to ignore (he is a professor in a STEM field). They know my stance on the family and that I’m just not interested.

There was a health scare at a family event I wasn’t present for, despite everyone involved being vaccinated against the thing in question. My mother decided to use this as a starting point to make some points about vaccinations still being important in an email thread. For some reason she decided to copy in an email address of mine that I only use for important things (bills, job applications, official communication etc.).

My extended family went ape with their pseudoscience „rebuttals“, which set my father off. The whole thing has devolved into personal insults and angry Bible quotes.

I got annoyed with my mother, because this has now been spamming my email for a week. I agree with all of her points (she’s a doctor, she and my father know more about this than everyone else involved). But I’ve been very clear that I just don’t want to engage with this stuff, but now I end up getting these emails all the time in an address I need to check. She thinks I’m being unfair, since her original email was not only well put but also quite witty. She feels I should be backing her and my father up."	2	17	0.56

A little back story to my reasoning is the fact that she's crazy. My wife and I met while I was in the army and the first time my wife came to visit while I was 19 and she was 18 my MIL tried to call military police on me and say I kidnapped her daughter even after she was the one that dropped her off at the airport. After my wife moved in with me my MIL refused to visit and basically had no involvement in our lives until my wife found out she was pregnant. After my daughter was born she would come to visit and spend weeks staying with us and would even do things such as push me out of the way when I got home from work so she could hold my newborn daughter instead of me. Fast forward to the present she only ever talks to or calls my wife to see our daughter. She also blatantly ignores things we ask her to do while watching our daughter. My wife is a wedding planner and frequently works on friday and Saturday nights. I noticed almost immediately that I would go weeks without hearing from my mother in law and then on friday nights when my wife was at work she would call and then immediately ask to talk to my daughter. I don't even get a text from her on my birthday. I never hear from her but everytime my wife works she calls because my wife's not there to let her talk to my daughter. The last couple times I just started ignoring her. She's noticed and has since brought it up to my wife saying it really upsets her. So AITA?	24	18	0.83

Problem is the family is pressuring me to spend time with him on his birthday and get him a really expensive gift because 'he's your father and you owe him so much' but honestly he is an emotionally abusive, toxic, narcissist of a man and I don't like spending time with or around him. Among his transgressions include insulting me and my older brother, the aforementioned emotional abuse, making inappropriate jokes about me dying and thinking its hilarious, stealing money from me (and probably my brother too, but if he stole from my brother my brother never told me about it), manipulating me into buying things for him, and guilting me into doing stuff with him and the family. My mom is backing me up in my decision and is willing to spend time with him on his birthday and keep everyone off my back about why I won't be there (I love my mom so much❤) but recently my dad heard Im not going and so now he and the family are hounding me and trying to guilt me into going.

I have 3 younger siblings M(17M), A(10M), and N(9F). My parents would assign chores to my siblings and me however, my siblings never did them and because of that I was held responsible for making sure that they were done. I put up with this behavior for over 5 years now and never said a thing. For example, one time when my parents left to go shopping, I was assigned to clean the kitchen, dust the furniture, and vacuum the living room while M was assigned to clean his room and vacuum the downstairs hallway. M didn't do his chores and instead was on his phone. As I was about to start doing his chores, my parents arrived home. Instead of telling him to do his chores they yelled at me for being irresponsible and not having finished doing what they asked. Another thing that my parents did was make a rule that was ""no dating until out of college"". In high school, my best friend was a guy and we hung out and talked a lot. By senior year, he asked me to be his gf and I agreed. However, any time that M saw us together, he would snitch on me to my parents and I would get yelled at constantly for it. However, now he's a junior in high school and a girl asked him out to a dance and my parents allowed it. After that, M told my parents that he was dating this girl and they were completely fine with it. This was my last straw and now that I'm legally an adult, I spoke up and told my parents that they're not holding my siblings accountable for their chores and instead are forcing me to them for my siblings. My parents were not happy about what I said and told me that I was the one acting spoiled and should not complain because by doing all those things is going to ""prepare me for the real world"". I also confronted them about the fact how my brother is able to have a gf and I'm not allowed to have a bf. They said that I was an ungrateful human being and that since I'm an adult I should stick to their rules. I'm moving out in a few months and cutting them off for good. AITA?"	17	14	0.84

We've been together exclusively for a year and some change. 
We have fun together,  same sense of humor,  interested in the same things. When we first met she had low self esteem so I would compliment her a lot and try to build her up. Now I think that was a mistake.  

Everything was smooth sailing,  but for the last few months she's been telling me about different guys that have told her they're interested in her and would ask her out if she was single or have checked her out.  First I was just like ""okay? Cool I guess "" because I didn't really know how I was supposed to react.  

She continued doing it,  sometimes it was somebody she worked with, other times just some random dude she passed in a store. 

A couple weeks ago I said something about my female friends girlfriend.  Val said ""oh -friends name- is gay? Hm I thought she was checking me out before"". I pretty much just rolled my eyes at that.

We went swimming a few weeks ago, after we walked by a couple guys Val said ""did you see that? They were checking me out "".  I seen them sitting there but it didn't look like they checked her out, they just looked in our direction when we walked by. 

The last straw was last weekend. We went by my friend from works house for a birthday party.  My friend ""Will"" was there.  Will is a really nice guy, can talk to anyone and make them feel welcome.  He's also gay.  Him and Val really got along and were chatting a while.

On our way back to my place Val said ""I think Will might have a crush on me"". I said ""eh, doubt it he's just friendly"" she said ""no it seemed like he was interested"" I said ""Will's gay"".  Val said ""well then he must be bi because he was checking me out "".

I sorta snapped and said ""This has gotta stop. Everyone is not attracted to you or checking you out, some people are just looking in your direction or being nice "". 

She said ""don't be jelly I get looks and you don't"" (her way of saying jealous). 

I said ""I'm not jealous,  but this is beyond annoying.  You sound conceited, it's a major turnoff"". 

I ended up telling her she should go home that night instead of stay over at my place.  I haven't really talked to her since besides a text she sent.  

She text me Tuesday and said ""when you're ready to apologize for acting like a jealous asshole let me know"". 

I don't think I should apologize, but maybe I was being jealous and this is something I should just deal with.

My family and I Live in a townhouse complex with a shared driveway and seperate garages. Each set of two townhomes has a shared yard, and we have a new set of neighbors across the street. They often leave their dog tied up outside. Sometimes one of them is out there with him, sometimes he is alone. Every tIme he is out there, when I bring my dog outside, the neighbor dog tugs at his lead and occasionally whines. My dog does the same thing if he sees a dog that he wants to say Hi to, especially since he's recently become our only dog and is often lonesome. I always assumed that the neighbor dog was also trying to say Hi, so when I went out today and saw the dog was out alone, I thought I'd introduce them.

I kept my dog on a short leash and by my side so we wouldn't have any issues, but that didn't stop the neighbor from busting outside with a vengeance. He was very upset at me for coming across the street, saying ""Why would you ever do that?"" I explained to him that my dog wanted to say Hi, to which he said ""My dog is very aggressive, so don't ever do that again,"" I apologized and left, but I could hear him saying over the phone ""I guess we can't leave the dog alone cause the neighbors will try to fuck with him,"".

I've never had any problems with any of the other neighbor's dogs before, or with any of our other neighbors, so this was kind of a shock for me. Advice is very welcome, if you have some"	19	48	0.79

I 26 (F) met my father when I was 16th after he abandoned me and my mother for 16 years. I grew up extremely poor to the point i barely had enough to eat.  My dad always called my mother a liar and said that she kept me from him. This is a lie. My mother’s side of the family denied this. The proof is time and logic. After we reunited, he barely called and when he did, it was to blame me that I didn’t call him. Several times we were supposed to meet, but he wouldn't show up. When social services took me away, my father never reached out to help me. He said, before we met he spend over 40 000$ on a private detective to find me. I was going to the same school as his nephew but he couldn't find me? I won't even address all the sexual comments he told me. Years later, he helped me move. He threw my bed away saying it wasn’t good promising me he would get me one. He never did. I had to sleep for months on a floor of an apartment with cockroaches.  He knew this and gaslight me about it (while he lived with my siblings from another woman in a pretty lavish house). A friend of mine landed me a bed.  His side of the family is toxic. if my stomach hurt, they would ask me if I took acid. I never took drugs. One of them told me that no one would ever want to marry a woman like me. They all said bad things about my mother. We have a group chat and on birthdays, they would all wish happy birthdays to members. On my birthdays, they all ignored me. I have no relationship with any of them. My grandfather has gotten sick in 2021. I never had a relationship with him and he never cared to. My father called me crying and wanted me to go to the hospital with him. I said yes. On the day I was supposed to go to the hospital my father called me and said he would drop me there alone for hours while he is going somewhere else. Which I found weird as it went from being here for him to dropping me there while he is elsewhere. I told him that I was uncomfortable and that I was taking away time from a loved one with whom he actually had a relationship. He texted me that I disappointed him as a daughter but he respected my decision. Which hurt me a lot. I thanked him for respecting my decision and told him that I think it's for the best if I remove myself from that side of the family. Fast forward one year later, my grandfather died. I spoke to my father. I offered him my condolences. He is asking me to go to the funerals. He said that he didn’t say anything when my grandfather was at the hospital and that now, he will force me to go. The thought of seeing my family makes me really anxious. I can’t sleep properly at night because of this. I know that part of the family resent me for not seeing my grandfather before he died. I think it’s ego as none of them wanted to see me there. They need someone to blame.  I feel awful but on the other hand, I do not think it’s fair to ""force me to go"" without even checking if I am ok with it. Am I the asshole for not going?"	7	18	0.87

She would verbally abuse me when I couldn’t do my math in 2nd and tell me lies about people in my family to isolate me. One of the things she did that I hate the most is she tried to say my dad (53m) abused her after they divorced.

This isn’t to discredit real victims but when looking at her stories none of it makes sense, and not like she’s been traumatized but like she came up with the story on the fly and can’t fully remember all the details so it changes all the time. But also the evidence she brought to court barely held water.

Because of this my already broken connection to her fully died and I told her “I still have to come over to your house, I’m not making dad go through court for a mess you made, but you are not my mother and if you introduce as such I will immediately correct you think of it as being roommates.” And that’s how it been for about two years.

She sometimes tries to tell others I’m her kid but I tell them “biologically yes, but mentally we aren’t close like that” and I can tell it hurts her but having anxiety, depression and quite possibly BPD from years of torment hurts to. Recently we went to my great grandparents house and they aren’t aware of the updates of our relationship, they didn’t even know my parents separated until 3 years after it happened.
 
So she begged for me to play happy family for just 3 days and that would be it, and I said I would be less cold and short with her but I still couldn’t stand to say she was my mom. She said we could talk and then we never did. We got to my grandparents and things went well, I love them so it felt nice to be there but my mom tried to call me her daughter and I corrected her. After a few questions I told the full story with the abuse trying to break me away fro the people trying to help and my grandparents became furious at her saying you have to be a special kinda bad parent for your underage child to decide they don’t even see you as a parent.

When we got home she broke down and cried asking me why I have to hold on to her failures. I feel I might have aired out our dirty laundry and permanently stained her relationship with her grandparents. AITA also sorry for formatting I’m on mobile."	15	7	0.85

For context she had a side hussle where she would order things from China (phones, clothes etc) and resell them here. People would usually give her the money beforehand. The business was going perfectly well for about a year. 

Last year she decided to buy a tent from someone here which she would start renting out and since it was around her aunts wedding her aunt said she would rent the tent from her for her wedding day and thats how she would get the money back. She used the money people gave her including money from her savings to buy the tent but the tent never arrived and she got scammed. She had a prior parcel which was suppose to arrive last year and it included some things I asked her to order for me but it also didn't arrived. She has been trying to pay people back for months now and has been selling some of her personal belongings. 

I only found out about the whole tent situation from my mom after her mom came to visit my mom and told her what has happened. I only knew about the parcel which included some of my things. I told her beginning of the year that she does not need to worry about me and she should pay everyone else back first. Her mom told my mom that she is feeling really stressed because the police is now involved and people are pressuring her to give their money back. She texted me a few days ago asking to borrow a few hundred dollars from me to pay someone but I told her I didn't have money (I lied). 

Now the reason I don't want to help her out is because I already gave her my nail uv light to give to someone who ordered from her which was suppose to arrive last year and she said she will get me a new one. She already owes me and my sister so much money. She would ask me money for things her and there and tell me she would pay me back but never does. She would make promises such as ""I'll pay you back on Tuesday with interest"". My problem is not necessarily the money but she would always lie to me about paying me back instead of just being honest with me. 

I feel bad for her but I don't really think she'll ever pay me back and I don't want to give her anymore money."	646	56	0.96

I have an 8yo son, Ryan with my ex. Due to distance (the ex moved a few years ago) and hubby's ex being high conflict, he doesn't see her as much as he wants(he used to see her every week) so when he does, he totally pampers, babies, and spoils Nora. It gets to the point I cringe from watching it, yet he has higher expectations for my son, who's a 2nd grader than from his 11th grade daughter.

When Nora is with us, she acts completely helpless, like she can't do anything for herself and whines constantly for her dad to do everything for her. If he can't, Nora starts to cry and scream that she knew he never loves her and locks herself in the bedroom or bathroom for hours while screaming she wants to go home.

A few examples:

Daddy I can't find my shoes. Find them for me! Daddy I can't find my sunglasses. Go find them! Daddy I don't know how to put my plate in the dishwasher. Here do it for me! Daddy my shoe laces are tangled. You untie them! Daddy I'm thirsty. Get me a drink! Daddy I'm hungry. Order me some food! Daddy I don't the the angle of the TV. Move it for me! Daddy I don't know where my phone is. Look for it, I need it now!

And it's like that all day long. Nora also doesn't just say Daddy, it's more like DAAAADDYYYY!!!!! And the constant interrupting! I can barely say a sentence to my husband or my son without Nora interrupting it. If Ryan is talking to me or my husband Nora interrupts to speak over Ryan and whine until the focus is on her. I point out to my husband that we absolutely do not let Ryan whine, scream, and interrupt the way Nora does. My husband says that Ryan is with us most of the time, and Nora isn't so he wants to just make Nora happy and take care of her when she's here. That she's going to college in another year so he has very little time left of Nora being his baby girl.

I told him I do understand but Nora's attitudes and behavior are very immature for her age and babying her is not helping her. It's also difficult to be around because all day it's either whining, interrupting, screaming, or crying with Nora when what she wants does not happen fast enough. It makes me stressed out to the max and takes a toll on both of us.

Nora is not special needs in any way that we are aware of. She's a smart kid, we expect her to get a scholarship and she's involved in many extracurriculars. She's also great with Ryan when it's just the two of them and her dad or me are not in the same room. So I do feel it's all just an act for attention.

Eta: there is absolutely zero expectation for Nora to pitch in or lift a finger when she is with us. She's not even expected to clear her place at the table.

Eta: Nora has tried demanding I leave the house for the weekend when she's here. This was my house, paid outright, before her dad and I were together. I don't leave because I refuse to let her put me and Ryan out of our home. My husband in this case does tell Nora it's our home and we're not going anywhere."	90	71	0.89

My parents love my kid and they babysit every chance they get, my brother and SIL also watch him a lot (they have 3 kids and they are great friends with Andrew). My sister had many miscarriages throughout the years, the last one was just weeks ago. 

My sister loved Andrew at the beginning. Then he started showing interest in ballet, dresses, pink clothes, barbie dolls etc, all your usual ""girl stuff"". I'm fine with it, he is a child that is inventing his identity, and social gender norms are ridicolous anyway. He is also letting his hair grow long and it grew over his shoulders already.

My sister strongly disapproves of me letting my son be whoever he is. She always buys him ""boys"" clothes and toys, which he doesn't like so he never uses it. I have told her repeatedly to either buy him things he likes or simply buy him nothing. 

The other day she was watching him and when I came over to pick him up (my sister lives at my parents') he was dressed in boys clothes and his hair was cut (very short). I asked him what happened and he said that auntie took him to the hairdresser and shopping for approoriate clothes. He started crying when he told me. 

I lost it and asked my sister what the F is wrong with her. I told my son to go wait in the car and then I told my sister that she is never watching him again. She said that she just wants what's best for him. I told her he is MY child, not hers, and I'm the one to decide what he needs and what he gets. She said I am a horrible father and I replied ""you would have been an AWFUL mother!"". 

Sister cried, my mom said I didn't need to be that mean, and my dad said my sister was out of line doing that to my kid. Some of my friends said I was an AH for saying that so soon after she lost her baby.

He makes weird comments towards me (regarding the size of my chest and my body in general), asks invasive questions about my personal life (if I’m dating anyone, if I’ve been “intimate” if you catch my drift). He’s also been weirdly physical with me and it scares me because he’s almost taller than me and outweighs me by a lot. I’ve asked him to stop multiple times and he did for a while and then started up again. 

His bday party was not too long ago and I told my aunt (his mom) that I would not be going. She asked why and I told her I did not feel comfortable. My cousin texted me later that day asking me why I wasn’t going and telling me he would miss me. I told him he’s going to have to deal with it because I don’t like being around him. He got really upset and wouldn’t stop texting me so eventually I just blocked him. 

I was told by a few family members that I should just suck it up and deal with it for a few hours but they don’t seem to get how bad it is. I have refused to talk to him and I have been told by family how upset he was that I wasn’t at his birthday. I know he was only upset because he enjoys that I’m miserable around him. I know he is on the spectrum and for certain things I can cut him some slack but idk, is this one of those things I should’ve let go?"	11	15	0.86

We met on Reddit and we’re really fast friends because we both liked reading BL and GL, outside of that we didn’t have much in common but it didn’t matter because I already like her ( platonically) Anyways fast forward to a few months after we met the problem came. It was around 1am and she had called me, which I didn’t mind usually but I had an early class the next day and I needed to be awake for that class, I explained why I needed to get off the phone and sleep but then she got a little pouty and said said she had been looking forward to calling and talking to me, because she didn’t have many friends and she really wanted to hang out with me. So like an idiot I stayed on the phone till 3 am and overslept when she was finally ready to get off the phone. So this is where it started, she would routinely get angry at me and spam me during all times of the day. Now I didn’t think much of it because we wouldn’t talk everyday, she’d have to go for a few days and then would come back, I always tried to talk to her whenever she came back too but if I didn’t reply within the minute she’d ask why was I ignoring her, why was I being a bad friend, why wasn’t I answering her if I’m her friend. Finally I had snapped when she spammed me yet again. She called, texted and was extremely inappropriate. So I told her to stop, and that if I was a bad person I wouldn’t blocked her a long time ago, i told her I understood that she was lonely but it wasn’t my responsibility to take care of her mental state, I told her she doesn’t get to degrade me and tell me I’m a bad person because those things really messed with my head whenever she made me uncomfortable. Then she lashed out at me and called me a liar, that if I didn’t wanna be friends why did I pretend to be so nice to her, and that people like me are the reason she doesn’t have many friends and I’m a horrible person, and a lot of other things, she spammed me over the course of 2 hours. Which weirdly in turn made me cry because I don’t actually like yelling. Of course by the end she was threatening her lively hood. It was 4am when the texts stopped but I had already fallen asleep so when I woke up I had a panic attack, I had called her and texted her for 2 days till she replied and said “ Sorry, I was ignoring you because I found out I had bipolar depression “. I was livid to say the least so I decided to take my own break from her, she spammed me yet again but I just apologize and stopped replying, I never meant to hurt her feelings despite it all I really do care about her but now it’s really eating at me. So let me know am I the asshole?	1	7	0.6

I do online classes because my dad is too cheap and doesn't want me to leave our home or the state to attend another state's art school. I've recently been feeling depressed and upset due to my dad making me feel useless in my own home.

I see my classmates and friends furthering their relationships, careers, and families. I know the grass isn't always greener on the other side, but I've felt useless since I'm not out working a job or doing extra classes during the summer. My dad's always on my back complaining about why I'm not doing things like he did when he was MY AGE. Here's the problem: I've never learned to drive; I rarely do work unless my dad needs me in his work, so he'll pull me in if he needs an extra pair of hands. Sometimes I don't even get paid in cash until I have to ask him since I'd do 6–8-hour shifts, and I try to take the summers off as my anxiety can't handle too much work.

The reason why I've never learned to drive is that my dad believed I'd be too childish and treat the car like a toy. Which still confuses me to this day. Yet, my sister (F17) Has gotten TWO cars (A fancy sports car for showing off and a normal car for her to drive around.) and is going to be taking her driver's test soon.

I know being jealous is childish, but I don't understand why. Why does she get two cars, why does she always get his attention and proceeds to ignore me? I know I'm a grown adult and should be behaving like one. But it's literally like pulling teeth to get him to take me to the movies, with my own pay and willing to even pay for the gas, though my sister can get two cars no problem?

I tried confronting him about why he treats my sister better than me and he just told me I'm oversensitive and should get over it. I guess he was right because after that I was in tears for days, I wouldn't get even one text from him.... despite us living in the same house, he doesn't really talk to me and prefers everyone else's company but mine.

AITA for still being upset with my dad?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Forgot to mention, that due to custody between my parents in my later teen years my custody was handed to my dad until I was the age of 25 due to my disabilities by the court who thought I couldn't take care of myself. So, he's the holder of ALL my checks that I get from the state and I can't touch a dime. 

I live too far away from any business that I can work for, and my dad has made it his life mission to make sure I never learn to drive nor touch the car unless I am to be driven somewhere. "	4	24	0.74

(Sorry for any unclear sentences writing isn't my thing)

I(14f) and my best friend(14f) have been friends for 6 years, everything was fine for the first 4 years.
But when we hit the 5 year mark she changed.
She would tell everyone I was gonna get with her ex even tho I told her that I'm mainly into woman and plus I still had a crush on my now boyfriend at the time.
But she just kept running her mouth it put me in a dark place for awhile.
She would talk about me to my ex she would tell him stuff I would say and do and to be honest I'm scared of what else she told him.
She replaced me with my ex which hurt.
She even told me she liked him.
It's like she doesn't care about me anymore.
I get this anxious feeling when I hear her nayme.
I can't even look at her without wanting to cry.
She hurt me so badly.
My mental health is shit.
Me and her went on a 3 day break and I hung out with her ex who I've become friends with since she's now hanging out with my ex.
And it was....great,it kills me to say but I didn't have any worries but then she texted me saying how ""I looked happier with k(her ex)"".
I'm stuck on what to do.

Edit: My sister went behind my back and had a talk with her about this behavior awhile ago and I also explained to her that I felt hurt so to me there's no point in sitting down and talking this out anymore."	0	11	0.5

My fiancé has a 6 year old niece and she's going to be our flower girl. My brother said no because my nephew has sensory issues so he probably won't like wearing a suit or being in a strange place around so many strangers. The thing is, no one else in our families or friend group besides my brother and future BIL have children younger than their 20's. I've told brother my nephew doesn't need to be there the whole time, just for a few pictures before the wedding and to walk up the aisle with the rings. After that my SIL and/or brother, or someone else can drive back to town and take him home. He doesn't need to be at the rest of the wedding or reception if my brother doesn't think he'll do well or have sensory overload. My brother and SIL think I'm TA for asking and for trying to find a compromise but I don't think I am because I'm willing to compromise and find a way that works for them and my nephew. I'm open to any suggestions they have as well but they still think I'm TA.	233	149	0.82

So I'm definitely okay with saying I'm a partial asshole. But I got to let that other 50% go to the actual daycare. At some point the daycare fees began to pile on me. I made every payment on time until I took maternity leave for my other child (2 1/2 months).  The owner of the daycare was also going through family issues and stated she ultimately ignored my fees piling as well. Her policy does state that once 2 weeks has passed and the late payment wasn't made, the school would terminate the child. My child was not terminated until I pulled him out after 12 weeks had gone by. During the time I was still making small payments but 1 step forward 2 steps back. They just kept adding up. We spoke about me paying the entire price afterwards and of course I told her that I would do everything I could. She keeps bringing up the policy but her policy was not followed by her either. I feel as though the amount of late fees would not have added up if I would have gotten terminated sooner, just to protect them as well. AITA for not wanting to pay the full amount of money but the 2 weeks he was supposed to be gone.	2	64	0.58

Luckily I don't really need to be, as she recently finished her studies and managed to find a job. Great news, because it's a highly competitive field with plenty of interest, but sadly also a very localized field. The only places that offer jobs in this field are basically in two places, both far from where we live. As a result, we went from living together to her finding a place to rent for weekdays, and meeting up in the weekends. This is temporary until we can buy a house in between our workplaces so we can commute on an even basis. 

But unfortunately, the housing market sucks. Prices are exorbitant and unmanageable, with the exception being illegal renting which is still exorbitant for what you get, can't register the address and whatnot. She moved into a house with several other people, one being the owner/illegal landlord. Basically got a small bedroom for 500 euros a month. 
All is well for some time, until the municipality catches wind of the landlord's income. Now, this guy works full time but gets paid in cash, and is apparently getting welfare benefits from what we can tell. On top of that, he has 3 people in the house renting for probably the same amount as my gf. Yet he seems to be desperate for money all the time, asking for month's advances, bothering my gf immediately on rent day to get paid etc. He's had a divorce and has his daughter over on weekends, so we assume he's paying alimony and whatnot. 

Anyways, now the municipality is doing investigations. My gf moved out and into a different housing situation as soon as she found out as she doesn't want to have to lie. Now the guy keeps calling her and sending her messages saying he wants her to sign a document saying her monthly payments were donations and not rent. But the municipality started investigating because of payments marked clearly as rent, so we feel she would be digging a hole for herself if she signed such a document. The guy has always been nice and decent to her except for the pressure put onto her for paying rent. We feel we may be selfish or should help in some way but fear that it will bite us in the ass later. 
We also feel however that he might find her and accost her on the street to get the document signed, because he happened to find out she didn't move very far from his house. 

Will we be the assholes for blocking his number and ignoring any messages he might otherwise still send?"	31	30	0.93

After dating for over a year we decided to move to Nashville with his brother and their friend and got a house. We moved in at the start of May. He left town for his job two days after we moved in. A week into his trip we get into an argument and he breaks up with me over Snapchat text because he ""doesn't want a relationship rn"". I am devastated as I just moved states to live with him.

I love Nashville and met a friend that just happens to be moving into a new condo in September and offers me the 2nd room. After talking with my ex who I was on ok terms with, we decided since he's out of town so often, I will just stay in the house until September.

It was going fine and we were just hanging out as friends for about 2 weeks. I then find out that even though we are still sharing a bed and occasionally still ""sleeping together"", he has added new girls on snap. This crushed me. He says he unfriended them. We were ok again until a week later I find out he has Bumble on his phone. He later says he deleted it but then a week later redownloads it. Through the month and a half since the breakup there have been so many times where he is so incredibly rude to me and when I confront him about my hurt feelings he never apologizes or says he feels bad.

After continually being ok when he's gone but so sad when he's back I decided I can't live here anymore. 

Yesterday I told him I was moving back to Birmingham until my condo was ready. He shows no remorse in being the reason I'm moving out even though he was the one that insisted over and over that I was good to stay at the house and he liked that I was still there. I cried on and off all day because this just isn't how any of this was supposed to go down. We were supposed to be together and happy here and now im being bullied
out of a house I was told to stay in. 

Yesterday he kept asking why I was crying and then being unsympathetic every time I answered. He finally picked an argument saying I was being dramatic for moving out and irrational and immature. After repeatedly explaining how many things he had said and done over the past month had hurt me and him invalidating every emotion I had and trying to turn everything back on me I looked him in his eyes and told him I hated him. He then said ""no you don't"" to which I replied ""ik but I wish I did"". We continued the argument and afterwards carried on like normal until I realized later he seemed upset still. He said I was an AH for staying I hated him and that he didn't care what I had to say about it, he never wanted to talk to me again and wanted no type of friendship with me anymore despite us always both agreeing it was important we stayed friends. 

I just don't understand how he can treat me terrible for a month and now I say three terrible words and it's just over. No more friendship. No more hanging out. I have done nothing but cry and apologize since, something he never did over anything he said or did to me."	3	41	0.56

She has been planning a co-ed bridal party for several months, it takes place this Saturday evening. She invited my partner several times through myself and also invited him in person. My friend lives in several states away so she never met my partner until she was visiting a few weeks ago and excitedly told my partner he is welcome to join during a lunch date with myself and her fiance. It was his first time meeting them both. He is very much looking forward to it.  

Now today, three days before the party, she asked me if he could not join because one of her other close friends wants to bring his fiance and she ""can't stand him"". So she doesn't want my partner to come because then she doesn't have a reason as to say no to her friend who wants to bring his fiance. (Let me add I also think this is terribly rude since this friend is also in her bridal party and IMO should be able to bring his fiance regardless of my friends feelings towards him).

Mind you, I have spent several hundred dollars for this weekend alone (bachlorette and bridal party) in addition to my friend having a destination wedding...between my partner and myself we have spent close to 2,000 on travel and accommodations alone not even counting the wedding gift yet.  

Although my partner not coming Saturday admittedly isn't the *biggest* deal, it feels horribly rude to me. Additionally, my partner is quite sensitive and I know he is going to be hurt and take it personally, especially after being warmly invited by her in person.  

To me, there's the added layer of spending so much money on her wedding and then being told to leave my partner home last minute makes me have a sour taste in my mouth towards my friend.

As of the last 3-4 months I babysit them twice a month and the parents always order us wingstop tenders and fries. Tonight when I came to babysit, there was cheese pizza instead. The mom let me know that the kids said they didn’t want chicken tonight so she picked up some pizza from the supermarket (fresh handmade pizza that you just pop in the oven, wasn’t frozen). They were told if they eat a slice of pizza they could have 15 mins of iPad time before bed. They also are awarded dessert after dinner as well. 

Dinner time comes around and the pizza is served. The kids go back and forth with each other about who should try it first and let the other know if it’s good or not meanwhile I’m 2 slices in already (I hate cheese pizza but I ate it cause it was there). 8m is very picky so he kept trying to bribe his sister to take a bite first. He ended up taking a bite and said it wasn’t too bad so she took the tiniest bite after. Immediately said she didn’t like it and wasn’t going to eat it which turned into both saying they weren’t going to eat it. She asked if I could make her dinner and I simply responded with “your dinner is in front of you, you have the choice to eat it and if you choose not to it’ll be waiting for you when you’re hungry” she got pissed and started crying saying she’s not talking to me and that she’s going to call her mom and tell her (doesn’t intimidate me. I’m a teacher and have worked with kids since I was 14) I said she’s not calling her mom and that if she were hungry she would eat the perfectly okay pizza that was served to her otherwise she could have nothing. 

I don’t think I’m the AH because I believe if you cave into cooking kids food after already serving them dinner then they’re gonna get used to you giving in and them getting it their way. This is how you raise picky eaters.


UPDATE: 

5f ended up eating the whole slice of pizza after 15 mins of whining and me not budging 🤷🏻‍♀️ she said it was actually good (I think she was just trying to copy 8m who is actually the picky eater). 8m did not eat the pizza and went to bed having only ate 3-4 bites. He said he’d eat it if he was really hungry, but chose to go to bed without eating it instead. I told the mom about the whole situation and she was glad I stuck my ground and didn’t make them something else."	122	38	0.93

I’m currently 35 weeks pregnant and already started my maternity leave. My mil doesn’t work and she hasn’t since she had my husband (her only child). She has some health issues and keeps falling everywhere, she never looks where she’s going. 2 weeks ago the day we were moving, she fell down the stairs and hurt her ankle, so i do most of the cleaning rn cause she can’t really put pressure on her foot, but she still walks good and stays on the main floor, it’s just too dangerous for her to go up and down the stairs in case she falls again. We moved from a 4 and a half to this big house and i am extremely tired. I’m super independent, but she isn’t. She waits for me to make her breakfast, lunch and we make dinner together. This weekend, we were having dinner all of us (husband, fil, mil and me) when she almost fell again trying to sit down on her chair. My husband and his father were telling her she has to be careful before smg worst happens and i said yes and for the baby you will def need to be sitting down on a chair/couch to have her in your arms, you cant try to get up or walk with her. After we had dinner, i left upstairs for a bit and my husband told me why would you tell her that now she’s crying, you shouldn’t make her feel bad like that. What was i supposed to do not tell her and risk her walking around and hurting herself and the baby?! This morning, i got up earlier and finally decided to make my own breakfast without doing hers (i had waffles). She comes to the kitchen and even tho she hasn’t had waffles in the 2 weeks we’ve been here she decides to make herself some without talking to me. I then started some laundry in the basement and cleaned her stuff too. After that i was hungry so i made myself a sandwich without making her one, she doesn’t say anything and make herself one too 30 mins later.

It isn't that he's rude to me or that he has feelings for Anne (though I am tad jealous about him, yes), we simply aren't compatible when it comes to characters and lifestyle.

Last year Tom gave Anne the bracelet for Christmas. Yes, for Christmas, so more than a half year ago. It wasn't her usual style, nonetheless she was wearing it... and she's *still* wearing it after six months. Like, every day unless it really doesn't match her attire, then she put the thing into her bag or something. Apparently, she decided that it's her lucky charm or something like that and it helps her good fortune.

Also, we live together so I see what she's wearing every day, I'm not making things out of nothing.

It really rubs me the wrong way. Anne is aware that I and Tom don't like each other and now I literally see something that reminds me of him on her body *every time when I look at her*. I tried to talk with her about my feelings but she told me I'm making a big deal out of nothing.

I even bought her a new bracelet for her birthday, hoping that she'll switch to the gift from me. But no, she started wearing *two* bracelets and after few weeks she stopped wearing mine and only puts it on once in a while (like she usually does with her gifts).

Eventually last week I run out of other ideas and honestly was annoyed by the thing. So, I asked her to please, could she stop wearing the bracelet all the time at least when I'm around? (Yes, I'm aware that as we live together, I'm 'around' most of the time.) She got mad at me and called me insecure and jealous. Since the argument she barely talk to me and yes, she's still wearing the bracelet. Now even when she's sleeping (maybe she's afraid I'd throw it away or something - but, for the matter, I'd never do something like that no matter how annoyed I am.)

I talked with my parents about that and while my mum agrees with me that the whole ordeal is weird, dad told me to stop whining and let Annie enjoy whatever pleases her.

AITA?

**EDIT:** Many comments mention me controlling whom Anne may or may not see. I never tried (and don't plan to) to keep her from her friends and family and/or control her social network. I may not like some of them but after all it's her life so she keeps contact with whomever she wants, as often as she wants. "	151	156	0.79

He reminds me of my alcoholic narcissistic dad and that triggers me. I want to put a boundary: if he's drinking and not in therapy, I want to refuse him entry to my home. 

I (37F) have been together with my husband (37M) for almost 20 years. My husband and his sister (39F) are very close, they call almost daily but rarely see each other in real life because we live far apart. I like her, she takes a little getting used too (big mouth, small heart) but we get along quite well and I look forward to talking to her and meeting her every time. 

About 5 years ago, she got a new boyfriend. She knew about his alcohol problems from the start but she didn’t think it was that bad and she didn’t want to be alone anymore (her words, not mine). She said that if he would start to become a problem she would leave him, but she never did. The past 5 years have been a rollercoaster. He gets drunk and disappears, they fight, he promises to get sober, she believes him, he starts drinking again, rinse and repeat. She does everything for him because she pities him (her words, not mine). When she asks I give my honest opinion but I don't put pressure on her to leave the relationship. She’s a grown woman, she can make her own decisions and manage her own life as she sees fit. It does however break my heart to see her getting hurt so often.

I’m going to be honest, I don’t like the guy. I want to stress the fact he’s been absolutely correct with me, not aggressive, inappropriate or whatever, but I can’t help the red blaring alarms that go off every time I see him, and every cell in my body tells me to just GTFO. Last time he had that sour smell of neglected human marinated in fresh alcohol, trying to cover it up with chewing gum and failing miserably.

He reminds me of my alcoholic narcissistic father whom I had to deal with growing up. I really did my best to give him a chance. He messed up the first one by drinking, disappearing and getting her upset and crying on the phone. I gave him a second one after he went into therapy and got a job, only to see it messed up again. It's getting increasingly hard for me to be around him knowing what he's putting my sister in law through. 

There's been some planning going on between my husband and his sister for them visiting us. This means they'll be staying at our place for a week or maybe more. I feel guilty for writing this down, but I don't want him in my house unless he's sober. I feel I'm condoning his behavior towards my sister in law otherwise. I talked to my husband about this and he knows my feelings and my standpoint. If we refuse him in our home it will cause drama. I get it, it's easier to just smile and get along with it, but I can't anymore. 

So, dearest people of the internet, I would like your verdict: WIBTA for denying my alcoholic sister in law's boyfriend entry to my home unless he's sober? Thanks in advance.

Edit: dropped the therapy part, it was unfair."	23	16	0.84

growing up my dad was the one working while my mom was a stay at home mom yet she never did her “stay at home mom” duties. all day she would stay locked up in her room. whenever my sister and i needed something we would knock on the door and without us saying anything she would say tell me later. when my dad came home he would be the one cooking dinner and making sure i did my hw and got my sister and i ready for bed.

my dad worked abt 12 hours a day and was in the military so he would come home tired. i only have memories mainly with my dad like him teaching me how to swim and helping me ride a bike. while with my mom all i remember is her locked in her room. 

after a few months my mom got full custody of us bc my dad couldn’t handle my mom anymore so for 2 years i never spoke with my dad. then when i was 13 i started talking and seeing my dad again. i started seeing my dad every other weekend or at least once a month. my mom shortly after started getting really sick and has been in and out of the hospital. my sister and i and some family members have been helping my mom make sure takes her medicine and helping her with everyday tasks like bathing eating cleaning etc. 

my mom is mentally and recently has been ph****ally ab***ve. mentally she would tell me and my sister everyday how “i bet u guys wish i was i was de*d”, or if we didnt wanna hangout with her she would say “i cant wait till i drop de*d and you guys will regret it” and here are some more examples she would say “do u want me to k**l myself” “ur a little shit” “ur a bitch”. 

recently she’s been throwing stuff at us when we help her and thats when i told my dad i wanted to live with him. my dad said yes.

whenever i talk to my family on my mom’s side about how i feel with my mom treating me that way they always say “she just doesnt feel good and is having a hard time accepting that she’s sick”. then i start to feel bad for wanting to live with my dad. yet they dont understand is that my mom has been sick with this disease since i was 5 and never took care of herself until she got to the last stage recently.

AITA for wanting to leave when my mom is d*ing?"	84	36	0.92

Today I wanna talk about my relationship with my mom and sister, in which is not the best right now. My sister has always been the favorite daughter. She’s 15 and I’m 13, and she has a lot of things that I don’t, like her Apple Watch, or her planned room. One story in particular really bothers me, and that story is the fact that I got a chance to get an iPhone XS but I waited 6 months because I wanted an iPhone 13 mini since the day it came out. Turns out I’m getting an iPhone XR, in which is really good for me, but, I refused getting an iPhone XS and waited for 6 months to get a worse phone? Ok, next story: as I live in Brasil, the grade system is different, that’s why I’m in 7th grade. The grade that I’m in isn’t the easiest for me, I have a lot o difficulty learning all this new stuff that’s coming in. I usually get better report cards than her, but still, she calls me stupid and my mom does basically nothing. She makes me feel embarrassed in public a lot of times, when I’m right and she’s wrong, she keeps calling me a bunch of things like stupid, and she says I don’t know what I’m doing. My mom never does anything abou it and when my sister tells her I’m making her angry, my mom tells me to stop even tho my sister is the rudest of the family and everyone likes her but I’m excluded. Like she’s the rudest person I met, she even has discussions with my mom and doesn’t respect her, and I’ve tried telling my mom about this for a very long time, but she doesn’t do anything about it, and I’m just tired and don’t know what to do. I can’t touch my sister’s stuff but she can touch my stuff, she can enter my room at every time she wants, but I can’t enter hers and I have to knock to enter, she makes fun of me, etc… But, changing topics for a little bit, my dad has been divorced since 2015 and he left my mom for herself. She’s really in a bit so good financial situation, and my dad keeps pressing charges to my mom because he wants our custody, but in his house, we are constantly yelled at making things the wrong way or not doing what he wants us to do. He emotionally abused us also, by telling me and my sister that my mom is a psychopath and she needs to go to therapy or even a rehab facility. Anyways, AITA for not doing anything about it, if I am, what should I do?	2	9	0.63

So. I'm 19 y.o, and I just finished confronting my aunt and she is crying non-stop.

Everything started when she asked why I was so angry at my family, but I am not. I told her that I genuinely didn't feel anything. I feel neither love nor hate. Except for my two brothers that I deeply love. She asked me why and I started to explain that I had never experienced love with them.

I started to talk about my childhood and my traumas with her, how their so-called love made me hate myself and all the things I loved (for example their continuous body shame, their never appreciating a passion of mine, always comparing myself with others in order to diminish me), but I told her how grateful I am for their ""sacrifice"" (like giving me pocket money or always taking me in the car to be friends)

I told her that I can't feel anything. I don't despise them for never hugging me or ever saying something nice, I really don't. But I do not care about them. I'm just sorry that things had to go like this with me too. (my older brother has ended relations with them almost permanently). 

When I finished my long monologue, my aunt apologized for everything and told me that she did those things with love. She said she will get better for my little brother. I told her I was sorry but I, like my big brother, don't love her or no one in my family. She burst into tears and now I'm looking at her. I'm sorry .. but not so much. And I kinda feel like an asshole for this. As a child I would have given my life for their love, now I don't care anymore."	8	7	0.79

This is relevant but not the main issue In this situation. 

I don’t like to talk to her when we get into arguments so I tell her I will not talk to her and do not speak to me. She never listens and even offers to pay me money like I am some kind of service. This is what I am asking about. 

She offers and transfers £21 into my bank account for me to speak to her (I never asked for it). I obviously keep it and put it into my savings so I can of course save up. Despite the obvious bribe and what I feel like is objectifying me, I was happy to be £21 up. I felt bad but she literally offered it on text so I have proof. 

I get on with my day and she messages me asking for it back. This infuriated me as she clearly stated she was gonna give it to me to talk to me, meaning she was planning and had intention of doing so. At this point I could tell she was only bluffing, but it still upset me she did that.  

I held out for a little but in the end I gave it back to her but I warned her next time it won’t be sent back on the conditions she announces she will and I haven’t asked for it. 

So I want to know, am I the asshole for being sad that I had to give back money that my girlfriend offered me because she was bluffing?

TL;DR: Girlfriend gave me money to bribe me to talk to her after telling her I didn’t want to speak to her without me asking for it but ended up bluffing and asking for it back. I did after a bit but I am sad."	4	20	0.7

I am also atheist and have been open about being atheist. My family is very religiously Christian, so of course it would come as a shocker to them of my lack of religion. Ever since I’ve become atheist, my mother and father have been forcing me to go to church every Sunday, thinking it will somehow change my mind. It won’t. 

I’ve recently started studying for my summer courses’ end of course exams, which have been taking up most of my time and energy, as I have been pulling more frequent all-nighters. I’ve plainly stated that I will not be going to church on Sunday, hoping that my parents understand. I go to sleep around 3-4am and wake up around 4pm so that I can study during the night. Church starts around 9am, which would obviously mess up my sleep schedule. When my mother woke me up for church, I was a bit grumpy because I had gone to sleep around 3am and didn’t get my proper sleep, but what set me off was her telling me that I cannot use my school work and sleep schedule as an excuse to continue being an atheist. When she said that, I lost my composure and started yelling. I said that she can go to church if she wants to but to stop forcing me to go. I’m not even Christian anyways so why the hell should I waste my time going. She’s forced me to go every Sunday for the last three years and I’m STILL atheist so obviously what she has planned isn’t working anyways. 

Because of that, I’m now “grounded” and am not allowed to stay up late for homework. Which ticks me off even more because now, I get absolutely no time to work on my things and get things turned in on the due date because my mother keeps telling me to do chores every five minutes.

A couple days ago our friends invited us to play board games on the same night, and we told them we would join if the concert would end early enough. 
We went to the concert, we both were not sure if the DJ playing was the headliner or not, the music was ok but we both didn’t love it. After some time I googled how to get to our friends’ house and about an hour after we arrived I asked my husband if he wanted to leave. At this point he got upset and said that I’m not making effort to have fun, and that grownup people can make an effort to have fun. I responded that I am happy to stay if he wants to stay, and that I’m not enjoying the music but can only pretend that I am but I cannot make an effort or start to be interested in something that I am not. He says he completely disagrees and believes that he is able to do so, with the example of one concert of a band that I really liked. At the end he offered to leave but said he is not in the mood to stay because I am not having fun and said he is upset with me because I was googling „fallback options“. AITA for not pretending I’m having fun?

EDIT: I think it’s important to mention that he wouldn’t go to this concert by himself/ without me. That’s the reason I went in the first place."	6	16	0.8

We discovered that the park had tennis courts which we thought would be perfect for us to play badminton in. 

For some context, my gf is immunocompromised so we are taking every precaution necessary when we go out, especially since M*nkeypox is starting to spread in our state as well as the new C*vid variant. All of the badminton courts in our area are indoors, which makes transmission highly likely. 

The park has 4 tennis courts. Before we decided to reserve a tennis court to play badminton we read the rules that are displayed at every court. The rules were: 1) 1 hour max to use court, or 45 minutes if there are people waiting to use your court. 2) Soft shoes only on the courts. 3) No food or drinks. 4) First come, first serve. 5) No skateboarding or rollerblading on the courts. 

So technically, there were no rules stating we can’t use the tennis courts to play a sport other than tennis. We went to use the last empty tennis court. We had just put our bags down and taken out our badminton rackets when a middle-aged man holding two tennis rackets approached us. He pointed at the sign with the rules and said, “This is a tennis court right? And you’re not holding tennis rackets.” I was taken aback at how it seemed like he was entitled to the court we just started using. I said, “Yes, and? There are no rules saying we can’t play badminton here.” The man scoffed and said, “Well I’m here to play tennis and you’re not.” I just responded that if he’d like, he can wait 45 minutes for us to finish using the court and he can come play tennis. I walked away from the man and played badminton with my gf for 15 minutes while he stood outside of the court entrance staring daggers at us. A bit later I saw that a woman (I’m assuming his wife) walked up to him and I saw him tell his wife that we were using the court to play badminton. It seemed like the wife didn’t really care and told him to just leave. They left, but the whole interaction had made me and my gf feel uneasy as we are both women and having a stranger stare at us for a long time is very uneasy. If that man truly had a problem with us using the court to play badminton he could’ve gotten one of the park employees to let us know if we are allowed to play badminton here or not. If a park employee told us that we weren’t allowed to play badminton on the tennis courts then me and my gf would have left without any complaints.

We were questioning if we were wrong to use a tennis court to play badminton but another couple sat at the bench outside of our court waiting for us to finish so they could use the court. They did not call us out for playing badminton and neither did the people in the court next to us. We left after playing for 45 minutes and now I’m wondering if I’m the asshole for playing badminton at a tennis court."	20	43	0.72

I should preface we live separately but he had been staying at my place for a week on his own decision and had mentioned he needed to go home to do laundry that night.

We had both just gotten to my place after a long day, I had a gotten some upsetting news I was trying to process. He said he was there to be supportive and asked what I needed. I said I just needed him to listen to how it’s making me feel and just be there, I didn’t need any solutions etc. (it should be noted the news I got had nothing to do with us as a couple).
He tried for a minute, but then kept trying to “solve” the issue rather than just listen and then said he wasn’t sure he could do what I needed and turned to look at his phone.
I went to my bedroom to cry. He came in and again tried to console me, as I was sobbing at this point. I told him where my mind was, and he again tried to solve it. I said again, I just needed him to listen. 
He then got up and said he had to go get his stuff done and was sorry, and felt bad that I’d be alone crying all night. I asked if he was not coming back after doing laundry and he said he was not. Then I really broke down, I ran to my bathroom and just cried. I was overwhelmed and felt abandoned. While I was in there he left, he just left. I called and he said he was frustrated I ran off and he didn’t know what to think of that. He then said he had stayed for a week and I shouldn’t be upset he has to go home and get things done. And even if him just being there was the support I needed, it wasn’t going to help because of how he was feeling and would make it worse. He also said that no one had died, I didn’t really need him.

I was so hurt by his response. We’ve barley spoken since. Am I the asshole for thinking his behavior was not ok.  He could have done laundry at my place or waited until I was calm to leave. He hasn’t even checked in with me on how I’m doing. Just sent random tik toks and gone out with his friends like nothing happened. I’m afraid if I bring it up he will be upset I’m still hurt and justify his actions rather than hear my feelings."	4	14	0.66

I have not received ANY money or amounts yet because I haven't received a death certificate. His body is still at the hospital morgue. I am also out-of-state and will have to travel nearly 2k miles to handle everything. 

His family forfeited all financial responsibility for any funeral arrangements without telling me (I found out from the funeral home after I called them), and also lied about his body already being there. His former (separated) wife only agreed to release his body from the hospital if I paid for it. 

His family continues to pressure me about the amount from the policy. That is the only contact I've received from them, and this is the first time I am even meeting some of them. All three of my half-siblings (33M&amp;F and 30M) have bombarded me everyday to give them the amount and barred me from any initial funeral planning. I have been left out of the group chats and calls.

After much consideration, I decided that the best decision for my financial situation is for his direct cremation with no memorial, despite his verbal (he never put anything in writing or had any official documentation) desire to have a proper funeral and burial. All of my savings were exhausted during a recent 3-week COVID leave and subsequent unemployment. All traveling and cremation expenses have to be paid for by my mother. I am heartbroken, penniless, and beyond stressed. I really wanted to solve this as a family, but I know if he were alive today, he would be disappointed.

She had a decent amount of assets and properties when she died, and everything went into a family estate which was to be divided between me, my sister, and my brother: a house, a rental property, some land, and three cars. My older sister was designated as the executor, presumably because my mother believed she was the most “responsible”. 

Over the last few years, my sister proved that she was not as capable as my mother believed, and had mismanaged the estate. Rather than sell off the assets and split the money, she waited until taxes dwindled down the account before she took any kind of action. My husband and I decided to buy the house and the rental property from the estate, but it took her three years to approve anything. We finally purchased those two properties— we got rental property at market value, and then got the house at below market value (house needs $100k of work or more). Admittedly, we got a great deal on the house because of the “family discount”, but it wasn’t too far off from what it was appraised at. It’s important to note that we plan on living at this house permanently as we raise our kids. 

My brother got a smoking deal on the cars— a 2004 pickup truck, a 2008 hybrid with hardly any miles, and a classic luxury car that could sell for more than 20k— all for the price of 10k. He turned around and gave one of his cars to his ex-boyfriend for nothing. But whatever - that was his deal. 

Only thing left in the estate is the land. It’s been years since I deposited the money for the house and the rental, and because of my sister’s inaction, most of that has been dwindled down through taxes. Now, she has to sell the land or else there will be no more money to pay taxes with. 

My brother decided that he’d buy the land, but he wants a “deal” because he feels like I got a deal when I bought the house. He wants to buy land worth 150 to 200k for a measly 50k. His plan is turn around and sell it right away for full market value. 

My sister is so incompetent that she just wants to sell it to him and be done with everything, not realizing or caring that he intends to rip us off. Today I confronted him about it, and said that we should sell it from the estate and then split the proceeds 3 ways. 

Now he’s freaking out on me saying that I’m making a big deal about it, and being selfish.  Accusing me of “making everything about money”.

In my country and more importantly in my family, we show love though hugs, kisses on the cheek and stuff like that in general. I however, don't like any type of physical touch, unless i initiate it, or the other person asks first. It's also important to mention that i'm physically disabled, and any sudden movements around me, challenges my balance, and it makes me more prone to falling.

My dad however, has a hard time respecting that, and often gives me hugs and kisses, even though i've expressed that i feel extremely uncomfortable with this. Just now, I was playing VR and my dad came up to me, while i was unaware that he was near, and used this situation to kiss my cheek, without me being able to do anything about it.

This is just one instance of him doing something like this. Both me and my mother have had serious talks with him, to get him to respect my boundaries, but he never changes. He has expressed that he's sorry, and that he's only coming from love. I told him that i just quite simply don't feel very loved, when he shows no regard for me or my feelings. He told me that, that was a cruel thing to say, as he's done so many things for me. 

I love my dad, and I feel bad that I can't give him what he wants in this instance. And I also really hate that I'm making him feel guilty. I would love to hear other peoples input about this, so am I the asshole?"	45	67	0.87

My boss is on vacation and I was left in charge of running ship while away. So I (25/M) arrived to my boss’s house at 6:30am (this is where I start my day and where work truck is located) , and I notice that my boss’s 20ish year old daughter had friends over from the night before , and one of their vehicles is blocking my work truck from getting out. I knock on the door , periodically getting more aggressive with the knocks,like a normal person, for about 30 minutes. No answer, so I start alternating between honking my car horn and knocking (country property, didn’t inconvenience any neighbors) for another 30 minutes. Still nothing. From that point I try to knock every 10 minutes, and a total of 2 hours passes by. Meanwhile my boss has his phone turned off and I can not get a hold of him. The job I was working had an extremely tight deadline and going home was not an option. He finally calls me back and FLIPS out on me saying I am completely absurd for not walking into his home and waking his daughter (who I have met once) and her friends up. He was mad at me that I sat there trying to knock for 2 hours while on his dollar. I explained I didn’t feel comfortable doing that, as I barely know her, and don’t want to walk in on his daughter possibly sleeping naked or something along those lines. Even after my explanation he called me a total of 3 times that day to tell me how insane I am, and how ashamed he is of my actions, and it’s not fair that he had to pay me for that. This whole ordeal left me with a sour taste in my mouth and has me considering resigning from my project management position. I deal with this level of unprofessionalism and unfairness quite often.

(we are minors and have been for the duration of our friendship, i am three years older than them) 

at the beginning of this year my ex best friend who we'll call Sam, downloaded tiktok and discord. Sam made a lot of friends through tiktok and i was happy for them. they added some of their tiktok friends on discord and asked me if i wanted to meet them, i agreed and was added to a groupchat. at first i didn't like it due to having a hard time adjusting to the fact it would never be just me and Sam alone again but i kept thinking about how this may be a great opportunity for me to make new friends and to adjust. these people were nice to me and i am still friends with them now. someone was added and sexually harassed one of the members of the group in dms. the harasser told Sam about the situation and Sam defended them. 

Sam dmed the victim asking if they could forgive the harasser and understandably so the victim was mad at Sam for sticking up for them. Sam dmed me about the situation but Sam has a horrible habit of bullshitting the story and only explaining the parts that would make them the victim. i didn’t know any better than to defend Sam which put me in a bad position when the situation was resolved. 

eventually this situation ended but Sam came out of it thinking they were the victim. i also thought the same due to not being told the full story which made me feel bad later on though now me and the victim are friends.

due to this whole situation and the way things were handled by Sam it gave me a fear of opening up due to the treatment of the victim during this.

now that you have an idea of their victim complex mentality let’s fast forward to now. 

so a couple days ago i noticed that recently Sam hasn’t talked to me much and they had been upset lately, i messaged them asking if they were okay and sent them an appreciation paragraph (they complained i don’t appreciate them enough however appreciation is a joint effort they did not feel the need to partake in) and lashed out at me telling me i’m horrible, i need to do better, telling me i was replacing them and doubting my abilities. this hurt me as i try my best for Sam and clearly they don’t see my efforts.

a couple weeks prior to this i stated to them that i was too afraid to open up to them due to their trouble with managing their anger as we were both confronting eachother. the reason is because they lash out at any minor inconvenience and i didn’t want to face Sam's anger for letting out my feelings so i thought it would be easier to just keep everything inside but when Sam brought it up they told me that due to my reasoning of trying to save the friendship that they felt i was making them feel like an animal.

We’ve had several issues with them. They are late almost every time, on multiple occasions they have been 1-2 hours late. One time they left early without finishing the clean and when we asked the company manager if we could be charged less, they said we were lying. Additionally they frequently take personal calls, very loud personal calls, in our house, even after turning up late.

Today they turned up late again. I am moving out in 2 days and I specified that I did not want anyone in my room, I did not want it to be cleaned, as it’s currently organised chaos. I was sitting on my bed with no underwear on (I was about to get changed) when one of the cleaners knocked and then immediately stuck her head in. She asked if she could use the plugs in my room for the hoover. I said I don’t have any plugs by the door, you’d have to come in my room sorry. Next thing I know another cleaner barged in my room (I was clearly undressed) and demanded to use the plugs. I was stressed by 2 people barging into my room, especially since I had specified not to come in, and I said very sternly “Can everyone get out of my room, I’m not dressed”.

The cleaners immediately left and phoned my housemate saying they won’t be coming back again. She said “I’m 25 weeks pregnant, I won’t be spoken to like that”. She also said that I shouted at her, which is absolutely not true. I was obviously very irritated by the intrusion and also the general lack of professionalism but I didn’t shout and wasn’t overly aggressive. I just told them in an irritated tone to get out of my room.

I initially thought she deserved the tone I took with her. Now I’m having doubts and worrying I may have been unnecessarily rude. So Reddit, AITA?"	27	19	0.83

Sorry for any mistakes, not a native speaker 

One of my (M23) closest friends (F23) started dating this guy (M34) a few months ago. She's an extremely intelligent person and her heart is the right place, but she has a bad history of trusting anyone who shows affection to her very quickly. So enters the boyfriend 

He seemed nice when she first introduced him to our friend group, but for some reason I never really felt comfortable around him. He would constantly humble brag, asked her for money a lot and, as the days passed, made a lot of offensive ""jokes"", including racial and homophobic slurs against some of our friends. She would always apologize and he was quick to say that he was joking, but this started to tear apart our friend group, as did the fact that she stopped hanging out with us because he ""didn't let her"".

2 days ago, she said that she needed to talk to me in private on her place and that I couldn't tell anything to her mom. When I arrived she simply said that she couldn't stay friends with me or the others.She initially said that it was because she didn't felt happy around us anymore, but after a while she confessed that her boyfriend didn't like us and he was 100% sure that every guy in the group was in love with her, specially me. I said that this doesn't make sense because we are like brother and sister, she knows my girlfriend and we all been friends for ages. She said that her boyfriend didn't trust us and that we should all stop talking, specially because some of the others and I were, according to him, manipulating her into distrust him. She said that she couldn't believe I would do something so selfish after she finally had found someone she loved. I was dumbfounded at this, but then she went on and said that she was moving with him and was seriously disappointed and sad that I lied to her

Well, I snapped and said that there is a line between naivety and insanity and that she couldn't be so desperate to the point of ditching all of her friends for a guy who was sucking her money, ordering her around and would treat people she knew for years like garbage. She said that he isn't a bad person and we are just jealous. Her mom ended up hearing the discussion and got to the front yard to know what was happening. My friend told me to get out of there and leave her alone. I said that she was being insane and if she went on with moving with someone so fishy, it would backfire really badly. I went away while she talked to her mom about it. The next day I received a text of her mom saying that she convinced her to don't move yet because it's scaring her and asking me to explain everything. Also a text from her, calling me an AH for trying to sabotage her relationship and calling her crazy.

I don't think I did anything wrong, this guy is definitely bad news, but my girlfriend said that even agreeing with me, I could have been a little more patient

Apologize in advance as I’m on mobile. 

Background: My ex (28m) and I (26f) broke up late last year after 5 years, we had a place together and have two cats, Younger cat YC (6f) and older cat OC(18f). They were both adopted by his parents when they were about a year old and the OC was the Ex’s cat since he was a kid. YC bonded with me primarily. When he cheated on me and I kicked him out Ex said as soon as he has his own place he would come and get OC, as he couldn’t take her to his parents house due to their high prey-drive dogs. He said maybe 3 months. That was 11 months ago. 

I actually learned about 2 months in that the ex wasn’t planning on coming to get her at all, from a mutual friend. He didn’t even tell me himself, and had blocked me almost everywhere so I couldn’t reach out, not that I wanted or tried to. Which was fine as I for the last 2 years of our relationship had paid for all their vet bills and 80% of food/litter/things anyway.

Here’s the current situation; OC kidneys are failing, she’s lost a lot of weight and it’s getting to the point where in the next couple months I will most likely have to have her euthanized. She was old when I met her, and now she’s ancient. My ex and I from year 2 have given her 6 months at a time for assessment as she’s always had some health issues, nothing major but we knew she was getting up there in age and gave ourselves some criteria and prepared ourselves for the day we would have to inevitably have to put her down. (Things like not eating, drinking, not making to the litter box, pain indicators etc.) While she hasn’t hit these specific things, the increased water consumption and weight loss tell me that her kidneys are not doing good. I’m not going to do kitty dialysis or fluids, as again, she’s 18years old.

I have always considered OC my Ex’s cat, but he essentially abandoned her without a word to me. I have given her a good clean safe home the last year, and another mutual friend told me my ex recently got himself a kitten. Good for him, whatever. All her vet documents are in my name, and for the last year she has had a cushy spoiled retirement. 

Here’s where I may be TA: I do not want to tell him when I have to put her down. Every interaction we have had since we split has consisted of him being hostile towards me, and the fact he couldn’t even notify me himself that he wouldn’t be picking up his cat shows me that he didn’t care for her that much. I could let him know, either through a friend or his family that it’s time, but I don’t want to have to deal with him at all. 

Legally I own the cat btw, in my state it really ends up being who has paid for the expenses for an animal for a year. She was technically mine before we even split. 

So, WIBTA for putting down my Ex’s cat without telling him?

TLDR: ex and I shared cat, he left her with me when we split, she’s really old and time to put to sleep. She’s legally my cat, and I don’t want to notify him beforehand. WIBTA?"	20	78	0.73

And we both are working non stop, though he works a physical job I am a stay at home mom taking online college classes and taking care of our autistic sons needs such as doing the therapy sessions with him all appointments and taking care of the home. My fiancee is turning 30 at the end of this month and he loves going to the casino so one of his close friends/coworkers asked if my fiancé and I would like to go to Vegas all together for my fiancé birthday. 

So of course my man told me about this and I got excited about it because we'd get to have a break and get to go have fun for a couple of days. Wrong.

 I messaged his coworkers gf who is also a mom of a 9 month old and she tells me she was hoping to make the trip like a family trip and bring our kids. Immediately I felt turned off by the idea of the trip now. I was expecting because it was for my man's birthday we would go gamble a bit, get some drinks , go eat and be able to stay out late since I assumed we would be kid free. My autistic child has a hard time in social situations. He gets extremely over stimulated in large crowds. We take him places where he has to socialize and be in crowds sometimes but we try not to make it an all day thing for him so that's also a reason we wanted to have him stay with his grandparents so we can go enjoy Vegas. 

I told my fiancee about it and he told me he assumed it would be just us 4 without the kids as well and now is iffy about going as well. I'm not sure how much there is for kids under 5 years old to do there and I don't wanna be stuck in the hotel all night with the kids while not getting to celebrate with my fiancé. Besides we get to celebrate as a family at home with our son. AITA for not wanting to bring the kids on this trip or am I the bad guy here?"	24	34	0.85

(English is not my first language, so sorry about any mistake)

For context: In the beginning of this year, my best friend (16M) started to like this new girl in our class. I (16F) was also slightly interested, but I didn't give it much importance, since I was seeing someone at that time. After a while, my friend was flirting and being interested in other people. And as for me, my thing with that person was over, and I ended up making friends with the girl. At this point, the desire to be with her came up in me, but I didn't do anything because my friend supposedly likes her, right?

But, because of this detail of him wanting other people, I asked him: ""what about the girl? you don't like her anymore?"", and he said he gave up.  I don't know exactly why, but he really already seemed to be at someone else. In that conversation I ended up commenting that I was also interested in her, and he said he didn't care anymore. 

Everything was fine after that, I talked to the girl, it was reciprocal, and I even got a date with her. The problem was that my friend invited himself to this date. In addition to going out together, we were going to take the opportunity to hand in some resumes, and he needed it too. 

I tried to explain to him that I wanted a moment alone with her, and he seemed to understand, but then he started to look sad about it. When I saw how he was, I regretted saying that, and I said that it was okay for him to go if he wanted to hand in his resume, but he didn't wanted to anymore. 

So today, he texted me, basically saying that he tries really hard to sustain our friendship, tries to make me laugh, that this relationship was one-sided, and that it seemed to be on purpose that I didn't care about his feelings. He said that I don't make the effort to respond to his voice messages on WhatsApp (which are usually a lot, and I get home tired, so I end up forgetting to listen), and said that I hurted him for pushing him aside. I tried to tell him again that I just wanted to go out with her, but he just said ""now you can spend as much time as you want with her"" and blocked me. 

I ended up having a very strong crisis and breaking my phone, cause I haven't taken my medication for a few days and I'm not doing very well. So now, I'll have to wait until monday to have a chance to talk to him.

I just felt like I lost my friend because of some mistake of mine, but I don't think I'm 100% wrong here, as I've always tried very hard to be as supportive to him as he is to me. Anyway, am I the asshole for leaving my friend aside?"	1	7	0.57

I (28M) have been with my now fiancé (42M) for 5 years now. We have both been through a couple of changes in our jobs since we met (both changed companies after we moved states). Unfortunately, he was forced to quit his job in Feb 2020, at the start of the pandemic. At the same time, my company shifted me to WFH. He stayed home and would game all day, but I didn’t mind because he was safe (he was considered high risk). As we rent a house, we both contributed to the rent as well. He insisted on continuing to pay his portion until December 2020 (he ran through his retirement funds). After this, I had to take over paying rent 100% on top of all our other bills and utilities (outside of his car payments and his car insurance). At first I had no problem with this, as I make enough to cover everything myself. We agreed it would be just until he found a job and we would continue the equitable payments toward rent after. However he did not job hunt because he was severely depressed. He refused to talk to a therapist (I offered to pay for it, as did his parents and my parents) and didn’t come out of it until he found a job in July 2021. The downside of the job is his income is 100% commission based. He has done sales before so this was not a new field. From what he was told, after a year he should start seeing residuals from any sales he made at the start of the year. It seemed like there was potential so I’ve supported as much as I could. He works 7 days a week and works 12+ hour days. I We don’t get time together as a couple except Saturday evening and Sunday morning/early afternoon.  I take care of all the chores around the house (he jumps in where he can but that’s rare), on top of paying for everything. I also enrolled him in my health insurance to make sure he was protected. I work 10-11 hours and take care of our dinners. I then spend my weekends running all errands and taking care of the house. We don’t have time to be a couple anymore and he’s had to miss several events with our friends and family because of work. It’s triggered a lot of anxiety for me taking care of everything and feeling like I am alone. I’ve talked to him about switching jobs but he gets defensive every time. I’ve even offered to set up a meeting with my boss as I think he could easily do what I do, but it’s always wait and see because it’ll turn around. I told him I would even cover a majority of the bills if he could consistently contribute. I don’t care about how much he makes, it’s the person I’m drawn to. I love him and he cares a lot about me, but I’m tired of hoping for attention or fighting to spend time together.  I’m at my wits end and wondering if I should draw a line in the sand or continue to try and support as best I can and hope it gets better. AITA?"	17	9	0.85

We have lived far apart for a while, I was in an abusive relationship and she was and is currently in an abusive situationship. 

So yeah, I was in an abusive relationship, she always said I could come to hers when I wanted to leave him. 

So I left him. I moved my stuff to her house. Another friend we’ll call Samantha took some of my stuff to put in her attic to store until I sorted my own place. I was staying there a couple of nights then at Jane’s for a couple of nights.

Jane, as I’ve said, is in a bit of a situation with a guy who has made it clear he has no long term plans with her and is still in love with his ex. He has even said if his ex wanted to get back together he would drop Jane in an instant. But he spends all day every day at Janes house, he’s basically moved in 

I’ve witnessed many abusive behaviours in his part, I won’t go into details but it all came to a head (for me) the other day when we had to call the police to perform a welfare check on him after he made certain threats when she found out he was talking bad about her to his ex and still begging for her back. 

Anyway after we called the police and they did their check (he was fine, obviously, because he was just weaponising the threat, not for the first time either, she’s kicked him out countless times so he’s threatened before) she blocked him. For a couple of hours. 

Early in the morning she leaves me in the house to go and meet him, brings him back and he deliberately tried to start an argument with me.

I was already tense around him due to his abusive behaviours that remind me of my heavily abusive stepdad. He had shown aggression to me the previous day too. So when she brought him back and he tried to start an argument I decided enough was enough. I didn’t respond to his goading and messaged Samantha to ask if I could stay with her for a while. It was very early in the morning so I knew she wouldn’t be able to come and get me immediately so tried to get some sleep.

The next day (after the welfare check) Jane gets upset with me, says I’m leaving her like everybody else, he’s going now it’s morning anyway (that means nothing after she already brought him back), and that she doesn’t like being told what to do in her own home. I try to explain that I’m not trying to tell her what to do, just for my own well-being I can’t be around this but she’s not listening

I’ve just been through a breakup, my ex was abusive, now im in a house where the partner is abusive, and triggers flashbacks to the way my stepdad treated his children. It’s not good for me. (I hadn’t eaten and barely slept in 48 hours by this point).

My girlfriend, ”Serena,” and I have been together for 2 and 1/2 years. She’s lovely and I can‘t imagine not spending my life with her. Most of my family, but especially my dad, loves Serena. It’s sweet to watch them interact, and it’s very obvious that he’s very fond of her. 

A few months ago, my dad and Serena went on a hike on a mountains trail. According to Serena, my dad was holding Serena’s phone trying to take a picture of the view, and accidentally dropped it. He dropped it over the clif, so it took her almost an hour trying to locate it and when she did, it was cracked terribly. It was no longer useable and basically hanging on a thread. My dad apologized profusely and kept stressing about his “slippery fingers.”

When this happened, Serena wasn’t too mad and I got her a new phone. My dad seemed apologetic and I was more than willing to get Serena a new phone, so I didn’t think much of it.

A few weeks ago, my dad, Serena, and I went on a run. Midway through my dad remembered that he was late for something, and asked Serena for her phone to call a taxi. While he was taking the call, he dropped the phone, cracking her screen and her screen protector. It was not as bad as the first time, but still pretty bad.
He apologised once more and Serena wasn‘t too upset. She paid for her own repairs and told him that everything was alright.

A few days ago, Serena and I were at a family dinner, and my dad accidentally dropped Serene’s phone into a bowl of hot water. Serene doesn’t remember giving it to him and he claims that he knocked it into the sink. 

At this point, I’m annoyed. Serena is a very careful person and she’s dealt with more than enough phone troubles in the last year. Serena politely asked him to pay for the repairs, and he refused, telling her that he was “a poor old man that made a small accident.” 

I stoped in and told him that he should pay for it considering that it’s HIS fault that this happened. He declined and made a fuss about how his ”wealthy son is exploiting him for money.” Serena and I had to leave early. 

Serena has already paid to get her phone fixed, but I’m still pressuring him to pay her back. A few of my family members think that I shouldn’t make this my hill to die on."	6973	977	0.97

To respect both family’s traditions we are having two weddings. Me and my fiancé are splitting the budget for the white wedding and the Indian wedding is being paid for by his parents on their insistence. Originally we were supposed to have the white wedding first followed by a traditional Indian wedding. Now, that the wedding is less two months away, my MIL informs me that she had to prepone the Indian wedding because some people from her side of the family can’t attend anymore on the original date because of some issues making it take place before the white wedding. While wedding planning, I was told by my future MIL that during the Indian wedding I have to apply mehendi ( a sort of temporary tattoo) on my hands. I said okay. The thing is, if my Indian wedding happens before the white wedding, I would have by hands covered with the temporary tattoos and it would totally clash with my wedding theme, so I informed my future MIL that I do not like the idea of having the mehendi put on anymore. She was upset to say the least and also implied that since she’s paying for the wedding, she should have the right to decide. She said I was disrespecting the customs and acting ignorant. I talked with my fiancé about it and even though he didn't say it outright, I know he agrees with his mother. My friends are divided. Some think that I am right to want a specific aesthetic while others think I’m being worrying over nothing. I have had little to no say about what happens at the Indian wedding so I really want the white wedding to be exactly how I want it.

My sister (30f) and I (24f) work in the same direction so I asked for a lift to work that morning. She was going to be late so she told me to get out in the middle of the road (4 lanes and a giant round about) while traffic was halted (theres no traffic lights literally just road and cars everywhere) which I genuinely felt unsafe doing so, I hesitated and it started moving again so she had to drive round (added another 4 minutes to her journey) and I apologised for making her late.

As I was finishing work, she text to ask if I wanted a lift which I agreed to, however I didn't see till 10 minutes after, that she told me to walk to some traffic lights.

I had 2 options: walk the pedestrian way which takes me 10 mins to get to said traffic lights or the vehicle way that she usually drives which would take me 20 mins. I took the pedestrian way and I rang her several times and text her to tell her the direction I am walking in and which car park to head towards so I wouldn't have to jump in, in the middle of traffic. When I finally got through to her i ask where to meet and suggest surrounding car parks but she insists on me to just walk to the traffic lights.

I am about 2 feet away from the traffic lights when she pulls up beside me in the middle of the road and I have to quickly jump in and she's talking to someone berating me over the phone for not being where she told me and making her waste petrol.  

Seeing the mood she's in I just stay quiet to avoid conflict, but that's exactly what she's looking for so she asks me why I wasn't where she told me to be. I stay quiet because I know its rhetorical in a way that she would call me stupid whatever the answer was, but she kept asking it and I stayed quiet.

 Because I was refusing to answer, she then told me to get out the car, proceeded to go to a random road that I didn't know and rang our mom to tell me to get out the car. Atp I just had enough of her shouting and couldn't believe she rang mom, so I got out. She drove away without even looking back (she didn't even know where she chucked me out), I had to find my way to the closest recognisable landmark and make my way home from there. 

This isn't the first time she's told me to get out of her house,  threatened to leave me somewhere or completely berated me over a simple miscommunication, which she has never even attempted with other people in her life and honestly I'm just wondering if I deserve it at this point.
Does me making her late really warrant that kind of reaction? 
I even said sorry that morning as I left the car. She hasn't and will not ever apologise for her actions (she never does)
I wouldn't expect even my coworkers to treat me with such dismissal, but my own sister treats me like shit and if I address it she'll just justify why she left me there.
So, is it justified?"	5	12	0.78

We had specifically did it on Saturday to make sure our schedules were free, and all of us were besides 1. He was already traveling so he couldn’t make it. I was extremely excited, thinking we were gonna hang out, as we all haven’t hung out as a trio in ages. But, one of my friends was already avoiding it and wasn’t giving us a clear answer on whether or not she was going to go or not, and each and every time we asked she’d change the subject or something like that. But at the end of the day, she confirmed she was going.

Now, Tuesday comes and we’re all excited getting and getting ready early and everything. My friend tells my friend(let’s call her M) M to start getting ready early because she’s a little slower than us when getting ready, and she wants to act clueless. Saying, “wait what?” “It’s Tuesday??”. We both didn’t think nothing of it, just shrugged it off thinking she was just being forgetful, as she always has.

But it comes later in the day, like 12-ish, a couple of hours before the movie, and she goes “I don’t think I can make it, I don’t like the way I’m feeling”. and we were both upset because she’s the one who really suggested it and made the plan in the first place. And she goes “I can’t go, I gotta go to the doctor.” and we were okay with that because if you have to go to the hospital then go, we can just go another time, right? Yeah, no way. She didn’t have to go to the doctor or nothing, she just didn’t feel like going for whatever reason. We didn’t even find this out through her, we found it out through our other friend who couldn’t make it.

We both got considerably pissed because if she just didn’t want to go she could’ve said that expect she lied to both of us and made up a really sad excuse on why. We started grilling her for it saying things like “you didn’t have to lie” and things like that. She told it was for personal problems and wanted to avoid something but never told us that beforehand. We would’ve understood the personal problems and I tried to explain that to her, as my other friend did. And she was saying things like “it’s not that serious” “you have each other” and yeah we did, but we planned this all together. She canceled out a few hours and suddenly had issues and stuff the day it was happening? We didn’t really believe, but we just dropped it because if she didn’t wanna tell us the truth, simple as that. Of course we were still upset at her lying but it wasn’t whatever.

Now, here goes like an entire hour later and I guess she felt bad for lying and said something along the lines like “if I go will you guys stop saying I’m lying?” as if we were still on the topic, we were talking about totally different things and she just brought it up out of nowhere.

We were both really confused and I said nobody is forcing her to go, because if she doesn’t want to go nobody can make her really. At the end of the day, we just went without her and had a lot of fun.

So, AITA for blowing up on her???

Edit: I’d like to mention her household life is completely fine besides a couple of arguments with her mom, she has no previous cases of anxiety nor depression and hasn’t been diagnosed recently either. She was also going to the doctor because she managed to sallow a piece of plastic, although she never went."	8	11	0.7

I also have a very large family on my dads side. 18 cousins, half are married and all my aunts and uncles and some of there families as well always come. I love all of them and being with every one of them whenever we can. We have a big meal and lots of food on these holidays as well. 

Since my dad died my mom still came to those parties for a year but then she felt disconnected so she stopped.  She met a guy who had a couple kids and started dating him. She’s spend holidays with them and said it works so I go to my dads side. I still loved with her at the time. And it worked out. She would do holidays on the day before or after and invite her bfs family. Then on the holiday me and my brother went to our cousins. And again like I said we are close they are all basically best friends/brothers and sisters to us. 

Now this year I am married. Just got married.  My cousins are having thanksgiving again and everyone is going. My mom says she’s having thanksgiving on the day now and is essentially yelling at me to go to it. Saying “I’m gonna cry if you choose them over me” telling me and my wife we are too young to understand what to do and have to go to hers. We do not want to for the way she’s acting. It feels she wants to do it on thanksgiving now to complete so we go to hers over my cousins. If we go to her it’s just her and boyfriends family. Who I like him he’s great and has helped me with a lot. But I’d rather just be with my big family. And she’s doing good the same time as them essentially so I’m in a bind.  

Am I the asshole for not wanting to go to her? Feels like she’s trying to manipulate me to go the way she talks about she’ll be sad if we don’t choose her and all this crap."	17	13	0.95

I found out yesterday that my grandma on dad's side had passed away around 7pm when my brother called me from his room and said ""Hey (my name) grandma died."" And that's it, that's how I found out, all my brothers, who are not few since the family is big, already knew, even my mother, who doesn't talk to anyone on my father's side, already knew, only I didn't.
When I asked my brother what time was the funeral he just said it was early in the morning, since he didn't give me a time or anything I asked my other brothers who didn't know either, apparently nobody knew or didn't want to tell me so I decided to get up very early and try to go.
I woke up today around 6 am to try to go see her one last time, I tried to call my father in the morning and nothing, I called my brothers and nothing, no one answered me, as you can imagine I missed the funeral, only after 2 pm my brother told me that our father called him at nine-thirty in the morning, extremely sad asking why we didn't go send her off. 

Only when I spoke to my sister-in-law in the afternoon that I found out that none of my Father's biological children, myself included, showed up at the funeral. Only my older brother went (he skipped work to go, helped carry the coffin, read a passage from the Bible during the funeral that there was no one to read and my sister-in-law says he came home crying). 

Anyway, I, the youngest child, missed my paternal grandmother's funeral, I missed the last chance to see her one last time, and I left my family sad with me for not going.
 
Lastly, I found out this evening (it's 11:08 pm) that none of my brothers wanted me to go to the cemetery (2 of them because none of them wanted to go to the funeral and they didn't want to take the blame alone so they dragged me in too) and my brother who went said it was a good thing I didn't go because he didn't want to see me sad.

(And no, my father had no obligation to tell me anything because he just lost his mother and I can't even imagine what this feels like, for me it was just my grandmother, for him it was his mother, the person who raised him his whole life.)

Anyway, am I the asshole for not going to my grandma's funeral?

We've never had serious issues before and have always confided in each other about any issues we've had.

Six months ago Lisa asked me out for dinner to a new tapas place. I'm Spanish, I miss tapas greatly, so I was excited to go. After we were done she apologetically told me she forgot her wallet - no issue, it happens, I covered the bill, which was massive (why are tapas only cheap in Spain?). She never paid me back. This has happened several times since then. I've tried asking her if she has money troubles but she only laughed uproariously. She'd then tell me she would wire me the money as soon as she got home. She never did.

Yesterday we went to the same tapas place with some more friends. On the way there I was talking to a friend of ours about how we had gone to the restaurant before, how delicious it was. I then said ""oh yeah that's when Lisa forgot her wallet"" and then added, mostly joking ""and she never paid me back"". I genuinely wasn't trying to start anything but I can't deny I was miffed. I had talked to her about the money several times before but had never gotten anything back apart from ""omg I'm so sorry I'll transfer it as soon as I get home, I'm really sorry!!"".

Well Lisa obviously overheard and although she looked kinda pissed she said ""oh gosh yes that's true I keep meaning to transfer it to you. How about this, I'll cover your bill tonight?"" I was super happy about this and accepted gratefully.
We then got to the restaurant and before we went in, some of us were smoking outside and I saw inside her bag which was weirdly empty. I then asked her if she had her wallet with her. She dismissed me laughing and said ""of course I do"". I then told her ""look I just saw your bag, I don't think your wallet is in there and frankly, I'm not setting a foot inside this restaurant before you show us you brought it.""

Gotta admit, I was really angry at that point because it really felt like she was going to use me again, since I was her closest friend there. Everyone else didn't understand the context and just looked at me weird and told me to calm down.
Well long story short: we fought and it turned out she really hadn't brought it. I yelled at her that this was the fifth time in six months and that I was done paying for her only to never get my money back. I then went home.

I feel guilty but also kind of happy that I stood up for himself. On the other hand, Lisa is super hurt by the whole thing, keeps saying I humiliated her and that she never did it purposefully. When I asked her how it's possible this has never happened in 12 years of friendship but has now happened five times in six months, she had no answer. We are speaking but things are really tense and uncomfortable."	807	154	0.97

My driving made him very nervous. He said he doesn't feel safe and he never wants to drive with me on a trip together again. He called me a terrible, unsafe and reckless driver who refuses to follow the law. I was honestly shocked to hear this. No one else had ever told me that before and now I hear this from my own father. Of course, this doesn't change how I feel about my father and I still love him the same.

The main issue he said, is driving too slow in the left lane. This was on a trip from the SF Bay Area to LA. We took I5 the whole way down and back. The speed limit is 70 MPH most of the way and there are only two lanes in both directions for most of the journey. Aside from stopping periodically to take breaks, I stayed entirely in the left lane going on average 80 to 85, which I felt was plenty fast enough to keep up with most of the traffic. It's already 10 to 15 over the speed limit for that matter but it's a speed I felt was necessary and reasonably safe to travel consistently in the left lane. Most drivers were going about that though there were quite a few cars going upwards of 90 to 100. There were also a lot of semi trucks traveling in the right lane throughout the journey. At times there were trucks passing other trucks in the left lane, which slowed down traffic briefly. There were also occasionally cars ahead of me driving a bit slower than traffic in the left lane.

His argument is that I didn't get back in the right lane to let faster drivers pass, not even once. There were signs along the way that read, slower traffic keep right. He said I am breaking the law by not getting over, which is what I'm supposed to do and what is the safe thing to do, regardless of how much faster the drivers behind me are going. I was impeding traffic, according to him, and creating a potentially very dangerous situation that made him extremely uncomfortable. He told me there are no excuses for my behavior and I don't get to drive how I want when it's against the law.

I believe I was doing my best to drive safely and follow the laws of the road. I don't think I should have to constantly get over to let drivers pass when they are going too fast to be safe to begin with. And if they were tailgating for very long or clearly getting road rage, I would get over still. Thankfully that didn't happen and all the drivers ended up passing on the right almost immediately. For that matter, If I were to get over for them I might not do so in time before they are passing right next to me, which would potentially create a safety hazard. So staying put at a reasonable speed appears to be my safest option the majority of the time.

AITA for driving in this manner? Should I apologize to my father and compromise on my driving behavior so he will ride with me again?"	22	84	0.84

So I (28M) had a nervous breakdown in the beginning of the year and had to return home from teaching abroad. My parents (my mother particularly) was worried sick and my parents were really glad to have me back at home.

They encouraged me to find a job here and consider living here permanently, but from the beginning I told them that I was just taking a break and I'd be back out there ASAP. I asked them if they could help me get back out there (monetarily) but they refused, stating it was a waste of time and they'd rather have me back here furthering my education.

After literally 6 months I eventually found a job in a bookshop, but got fired after 1 month for ""wrong demeanor"". This caused me to sell some of my stuff and raise money enough for me to move back abroad to continue my career as a teacher. I get their point of view, but in the end it's my decision what I choose to do with my life and I do have a plan to better myself and my family when I move back abroad. My parents are ageing, they both have diabetes and are still working , and I hate the fact that I just sit at home unemployed while they provide everything.

AITA for freeing myself? My home country has a nearly 40% unemployment rate, crime and a myriad of problems not worth staying for. My family is Christian and I am aware that they will view this as an affront of some kind when I'm only trying to do what's best for all of us. I haven't told them I want to go back since I raised the money, but they know it's been on my mind. I guess I'm here for a bit of encouragement."	19	9	0.9

We're in the truck heading back home on the road and I said I'm hungry. My stepdad chimed in, ""Why are y'all always eating? We're on the road you shouldn't need to eat so much."" 

I bit my tongue because I knew if I said something, it would turn into a fight between all 4 of us. However as someone who's struggling with food and body image issues, this angered and hurt me. I don't believe my step dad knows about my struggles, but it's still highly inappropriate to say at all. 

My stepdad and I have never gotten along because I am very headstrong and outspoken. He doesn't like that I do not bend and bow or turn my cheek. I am very ""unladylike"". Now I am not without my faults. I am very sensitive so this is maybe where I feel like I'm blowing things out of proportion, but I feel it's important to make this a hill to die on. 

So after I said I was hungry, we stopped off at McDonalds and we had to circle around cuz my mom missed the entrance. We passed two women standing around their car and my stepdad said ""mira a las gordas"". It was not in an endearing way. He literally said ""look at those fat women."" They were average weight women who have normal body weight. This was certainly not the first time he has said this kind of stuff and I had to hold my tongue time and time again. But being hungry and tired from this trip, I snapped and told him, ""Would you stop referring to women like that?"" 

He said nothing, raised up the volume on the radio and ignored me, but I could feel the tension in the truck. 

So when my mom got back from ordering, I wasn't too hungry. I lost my appetite but I forced myself to eat a little bit. I am struggling with body and food issues so this jabbed me. These comments about weight—even if they weren't directed at me—pissed me off. 

We're all in the truck, my mom's driving, my step dad is asleep in the front passenger seat and I told my mom that I feel we need to address this here and now, not in the next 10 hours after we get home (long trip from Chicago to get back home). 

She said that my step dad is ""Set in his ways."" and that I, ""take offense to everything. Not everyone agrees with the same things. I don't agree with everything in the LGQP (her words) but it's just how it is."" 

I am angry because my mom definitely knows about my issues and instead of saying anything helpful, she just dismissed it and also disrespected the LGBTQ+ community (which I am also a part of). Now we've all butt heads there, but that's a story for another day. 

I am just sitting here in an uncomfortable truck listening to my music and ignoring everything else. I am truthfully upset, so am I an overreacting A-hole? Or is this something I should definitely be angry about?"	54	33	0.88

She often lies to the doctors that she smokes outside, because we have asthma. She knows she not supposed to but she does. Our house, cars , clothes smell like cigarettes. Her mother also got lung cancer from smoking

I recently started voicing my dislike and asking her to not smoke next to me in the car and started refusing to wear anything of hers unless its been deep washed and no longer wanted to use the car that smells like smoke (we have a car that doesn't smell but she doesn't use it often ) and that I wish she would quit or at least not do it around me (I know addiction is hard)Now, I personally do not mind the smell since Im used to it. Issue is, I work with Elderly and I'm In culinary where our chef is strict about the smell of stuff like that and also I've started to get picked on for the smell and my boyfriend(m 17) has pulled me aside to let me know how bad the smell is.  So I now have 4 different body sprays incase

I've been voicing this for 2-3 months, we talked yesterday and she says Im an asshole for wanting her to not smoke next to me and to not take the smoke car and spraying my self down and that Im over exaggerating. I've always been made fun of for smelling like smoke or cat piss my whole life, it stopped for a bit but It started up again. I had recently worn my mom hoodie to school and a kid said I smelt like pure smoke, and my teacher who is an ex smoker agreeded and she let me spray myself down with body spray. Than with my boyfriend mentioning it. Than with my  chef saying its unprofessional and me working with elderly I've been wanting to not smell like it.

So AITA for my actions? I understand she cannot stop smoking and what I've been doing has been making her feel bad but I wanna be professional and not smell like smoke

I decided to share this and doing out who was the AH.

We had a little friendgroup. One of the girl, call her A, had other friends too, which was not the problem, she known them for longer and at first they were really friendly and we liked them, even played videogames with them sometimes.
These other friends of hers wanted to make a surprise party for her. We were down for it. They came up with the idea of making coctails at home. The original plan was going to a bar, because A wanted to go to that place. However they thought a surprise party with homemade coctails would be better, which was... Untill...

In the groupchat we discussed everything. They said they will buy the booze. We thought okay, you know what coctails you want to make. They managed to spend around 110$ on it. So we had to pay 12-13$ each. I know its not a lot of money in the USA but where we live, you can literally eat from this for like a week or half a week. ( We are still in school, one of us were in high school, so there is no way she could have worked, im still in uni, and my fucked up school scedule only let me work like 2 days a week in a 4-6 hour shift. So i made 25$/month. Personally i wouldnt really want to spend half my salary on booze).
We said that its not okay for us like thats a lot... And its just the booze. We should have bring food, pay the travelling and take some juice for the coctails. They got mad when we asked what did they spend the money on. They said coctails. There were like 4-5 different type of coctails they came up with. Most of the coctails are based on vodka, rum and gin which is not 110$ worth of money in my country. So we said we could not afford this. (yes we had some savings but its savings for a reason. Like driving licence, food, clothing etc.). They throw a tantrum basically saying that its not a lot of money, we would spend this much in a bar... No, we dont. I need one drink and im in a different universe. They even said that to ask our parents for the money and acted like they are piggy banks. The said friendgroup had a girl who lived with her rich parents, other girl who was rich, a guy who worked full time and etc... They just did not understand We. Do. Not. Have. Money. So we skidaddle. Left the groupchat and made a cake for A and gave her gifts before she got off to her other friends.

So AITA for not going because they don't even show us a receipt or told what they have spend so much money on?"	11	18	0.93

I really don't think my mom is malicious, just a bit dumb and socially obtuse, but I wanted to start my marriage off right, so I came down pretty hard with boundaries. My mom did stop the behavior, but doesn't socialize with us much anymore and acts shy and kind of weird.

My mom recently came to visit with her husband ""Alex"" Now I try to tolerate Alex because he makes my mom extremely happy, like this woman never really smiled when I was growing up and he makes her eyes light up. I really can't stand Alex though, giant ego and tiny brain.

Alex keeps swinging a golf club in the house and we've told him to stop (to be fair we weren't very direct about it) but he keeps doing it. We are worried he is going to hurt one of the kids or break something. My mom confirms that he does this all the time at home. Finally my wife sprayed him with a cat spray bottle. He finally got the message and is now outside in the cold shitty weather (about to either rain or snow) swinging his golf club.

My mom pointed out how sad he looks out there and I kind of shrugged it off. My mom then got upset and said I would freak out if she ever sprayed my wife with a cat spray bottle. She brought up various ways my wife was inconsiderate when we used to live with her (small stuff but I get it adds up) I apologized for that but said to be honest I would freak out if she sprayed my wife with a cat spray bottle.

All of a sudden my mom just flipped and said she is sick of the double standard and ""you don't get to treat my husband like that you dumb bitch"" I lost it and told her to get the fuck out. my mom said she was only saying exactly what I would have said if she treated my wife how we treated Alex. She started crying but did leave. Alex was trying to get her to stop crying as they left and said she shouldn't have expected more as I'm always a hypocrite and never treat her like an actual human being."	30	32	0.95

After years of trying I finally was able to have a child on my own. I struggled to get pregnant several years but luckily,I had my husband Michael by my side to support.

I was lucky tho,in a sense of Michael works in extreme well paid job so we could afford expensive stuff for an unborn baby. But for some reasons that  annoyed my step sister Joy [30F] a lot , she has four kids on her own and had a miscarriage (which I wasn’t aware of until I set my baby room up )


I tried to be very cautious about this topic with her since I knew how painful it can be at times. Michael and I accommodated her a lot during those times. I let her stay in our house when her husband kicked her out since he has alcohol issues. I tried to buy her things to cheer her up,Michael even offer her husband a job but they denied because “it don’t pay enough” etc 

The first time  Joy made me uncomfortable was when she arrived to my house once with her toddler and saw my unborn baby nursery at that time. She then revealed that she had a miscarriage and that it was insensitive of me to do those things whilst she going through grief. I apologised and tried to change the subject. Then she asked me to not post anything about my son on social media and asked me to not have baby shower because we can’t be that cruel to do such thing when her family going through a grief. I told her that she has nothing to worry about since my husband and I were not planning to do baby shower to begin with.

Second time when disaster happened is when I took Joy and her four kids in because she had an argument with her husband. Result : her kids destroyed my baby room , ruined walls , end up breaking crib and baby swing . And end up painting most of my baby clothes. My step sister only said “they just kids being kids”

Fast forward when my baby was born Michael bought me Mercedes as a thank you for giving birth to his son . Of course I was happy about it and shared the news of my son being born to my insta ,oh man ,I didn’t knew what was coming.

Joy bomb me with a messages saying that I’m rubbing in her face that I gave birth to a baby whilst she couldn’t . And how now I’m rubbing in her face that me and Michael living in luxury whilst she and her family is struggling. She said if I had 100k$ to spare for car I should have instead spend on buying them a new place to stay since they fed up with renting places . She also mentioned that she wouldn’t have miscarriages if I helped her more financially instead of buying my unborn child unnecessarily shit 

For some reason whether it was my hormones or something but I end up telling her that her kids it’s not my responsibility and that her miscarriage was a sad thing but she has no right to make me feel like it was my fault .

So AITA for saying that her miscarriage is not my responsibility and being insensitive about it?"	2416	434	0.95

My (16m) parents are divorced since i was about 3/4 and have always had different ways of raising me. Sometimes it’s like the cold war between them but not too often. During my childhood I’ve always lived with my dad (whom i love sincerely) until 1 year ago when i moved to a new town 20 mins away to live with my Mother and her now husband. The reason I moved was my Dad’s girlfriend. I hate her for 2 main reasons. First of all, when she moved in with us, no one asked if it was okay with me (mind you I wasn’t) and when she moved in she made my dad throw most of our furniture, plates, decorations and so on so she could have her things set up and have it the way she liked it. All of the things i grew up with were gone. The second thing is that i think she’s stupid, trying to tell me things like she’s my mother and not respecting my boundaries. She also doesn’t understand that she threw away my childhood memories. Oh, yeah, she also took a job at my school as the one who’s in charge of the cafeteria, where i hangout everyday with my friends. 

So like i said, last year i moved and have not met my father a lot since then because he always brings her and her daughter who is also a spoiled brat who think she always can get what she wants.

But obviously i want to celebrate Christmas with my father and i just have to suck up that they are going to be there and doing all sorts of things i hate. 

But now to the issue, I decided to not buy any gifts for dad’s girlfriend or any of her two daughters (one of which is like 23 and is actually kinda cool whom I haven’t mentioned in this thread). I am buying for my dad, mom, stepbrother (mom’s husband son) and i tried to buy for my stepdad but he says that he would go crazy if I bought him a gift since he’s an adult and I respect his opinion. 

So since I’m buying for my “step-family” on mothers side, should i buy for dad’s family as well even though i dislike pretty much all of them?

As some background, I have been looking after the garden for the last 7 years. Tending plants, Pruning, watering, mowing the lawn, blowing down the driveway etc. it isn’t a big garden at all and the lawn mowing will literally take me 10-15min. My background is in horticulture and also enjoy doing it, it is actually relaxing for me. 
This week I went to mow the lawn and she told me that she had hired someone to do it, no discussion, no reasoning, nothing. She had just gone out and hired someone and it was going to cost $60, for a job that is 15mins at the most (probably quicker for a professional). I asked her to cancel the person and spend the money on the children for Christmas or better still save it as we are wanting to purchase a new family home next year, but she outright refused to cancel the job. She even made me “hide” my lawnmower and edger so the person she hired wouldn’t see them. 

She won’t tell me why she hired someone else or why she will not cancel it and save the money and it is causing a lot of friction. I literally told her that it is upsetting me and I WANT to do it, but she has said she will not cancel the other person.

I (29f) have had a toxic relationship with both parents. When I turned 18 my father and I had a conversation where he told me that he had never wanted kids and knew he wouldn't be a good parent, he apologized for all of what he put us through and asked if we could try to be friends. My mom on the other hand refuses to believe that  she played a role in the toxicity. I have always been labeled as an overly dramatic , self centered, compulsive liar. She has maintained this narrative from the time I could speak, I lie for attention, I stir the pot for entertainment (just a few of the things she has said). My mother was always emotionally and mentally abusive, while neglecting us fully. 


6 years ago i had my second child ( my mom essentially forced me out of custody of my first) I decided to go back to school and get a bachelor's degree, I  was getting ready to apply and I was talking excitedly about it and my mom told me that I shouldn't do it. I had a child now and that should be my priority. I told her that I was doing it for her, I wanted to have a career and provide her with the best life I could, while also fulfilling my own aspirations. She told me I was being selfish dragging my baby and partner through school with me. After that conversation I messaged her privately and asked her not to treat me like that anymore. I told her we needed to work on having a friendship and that I didn't appreciate how she handled that in front of everyone (we had been at a dinner with all of our close family) I told her that if we couldn't work on having a better relationship I couldn't do it anymore. She told me to have a nice life .

Since then I've been outcasted. I have two aunts and uncles , my gran and my brother left on my mom's side. My mom hasn't talked to one of her brothers in decades but the other aunt and uncle chose my mom's side. I wasn't invited to any family events and for awhile my gran wouldn't talk to me.

This Christmas (about a week ago) my son begged  my mom to have me and his sister at Christmas, she said there was no way in hell I would be stepping foot through her door. I didn't care about going,I never asked. When other family members tried to ask why she said I had 'beef' with an aunt of mine and that the aunt wouldn't come if I did. I don't do drama like that. I'm confrontational and I'll come right to you to sort it out. I sent my aunt a message and she lost it. I tried to tell her that it had come from my mom and for some reason she just wouldn't believe it. She ended up calling my gran and essentially telling her that if her name ever came up again she wouldn't attend another family event again. My gran did nothing. 

Yesterday she called me and asked I would go down to my mom's work (about a three hour drive from me) one day when I know she's there (how would I know any of this lol) &amp; confront her in person to fix things. I told her no.

I was already very unexcited about this prospect after graduating, as this would mean that they would have an influence in the decisions I made; I could no longer decide to do things (e.g. go out with a friend all on my own, go out on a date with someone, etc.). It is especially because of this that I don’t bother to learn how to cook, my mom does all the cooking for me when I’m at home.

My younger brother (19M) came home from college for the holidays. He has a friend (23M) who is also visiting my area for this week.

My mom does not view that friend positively; the friend (I’ll call him F) has divorced parents, and F does not get along well with his mom. F never goes home for the holidays due to this, instead he goes and visits other places for the holidays - this time, he is visiting my area. She said that she is afraid that my brother hanging out with him would give him a negative influence and cause him to have contempt for his parents.

To show you the contempt mom has for the friend: Earlier this week, F messaged my brother to ask him to pick him up from the airport. Mom was already annoyed at having to pick F up from the airport, as he should have his own way of getting to where he’s staying, but it was only out of courtesy that she agreed to pick him up; “he should have his own way of doing so, he just wants to save money”.

My younger brother is having dinner with F, and I wanted to join as well. F was OK with having me along with the dinner. My mom said that she was OK with my brother having dinner with F, but not me having dinner with F; she said that “F is brother’s friend not yours, what is the point of having dinner with him?”

I then immediately said, “I knew this, this was one of the reasons why I was so nervous about living at home, it was because I would no longer have a say in my decisions, because parents would unnecessarily interfere in my decisions.” And then, I reluctantly agreed not to go to dinner with F and brother anymore. Mom got so pissed off, started ranting on how she thought that brother and I are not going to become good adults. She then started ranting about how we ruined this Christmastime for her, just like last year, some incident happened (I think I might be omitting some details in this, but these are the details I know)

I wanted to be clear: The reason why I’m pissed off is because mom was already starting to throw a tantrum, and I only decided not to join my brother in his dinner with F to placate my mom; therefore, it was not a decision made of my volition. It would have been a different story had I made that decision on my own.

Note: Because I do not have a car of my own, my mom would have to drive my brother if he wanted to have dinner. Therefore, she is always the one who would have to drive us anyways. For obvious reasons, she wouldn't drive me if she didn't approve of dinner with F.

AITA for my reaction for not going to dinner? I also think I might be TA for not being thankful for mom doing all the cooking/housework while I’m at home."	9	12	0.78

Well my love language is gift giving, it always has been so I have always loved to spoil him rotten and never have I expected anything in return. Hell I spent $2000 on him for his birthday and I got nothing on mine lol. Anyway for Christmas he has been raving about this $900 gift he got me, I didn’t care how much it costs it was just nice to see him out the effort in but the thought of him spending that much was a little bit nice.

He gave it to me on Christmas and it was the most beautiful tennis bracelet with 0.25 carat diamonds, I was obsessed with it. It was a little bit big so I had to take it to get some of the links removed to be able to wear it. To do that I needed the receipt, well when he gave it to me it was $200 not $900 like he said. I was shocked because why lie about something so small? Or why talk up something so expensive in the first place? 

I brought it up to him just asking why he lied when I don’t care about how much a gift costs and he immediately got on the defence and started saying that he wasn’t and even walked out on me. He called me ungrateful for the gift so I yelled at him. Explaining to him that I felt like he thought I was so shallow that he need to lie about something so stupid? AITA for yelling at him over this? 
I feel like the asshole because I probably come off as ungrateful and made him feel like I didn’t like it!"	12	32	0.88

I broke up with my gf (25F) 2 days before Xmas. I was on the verge of depression, I didn't celebrate Xmas I just stayed at my apartment but of course I didn't cry. All my friends that visited brought me tissues and when I told them that didn't want them they got confused. Fast forward last night NYE my friend hosted I small party at her house and made me come. There I got really really drunk and did many stupid things, as they told me cause I don't remember a lot, one of them was to call my ex now one thing I remember was when she answered she was crying I don't remember what I told her but I think it was something bad. The next day I got a call from a friend of hers telling how rude I was yesterday and that I never loved her because I didn't cry when we broke up I asked her how do you know that I didn't cry to my ex and told that my friends told her. I got mad I ended the call went straight to my friend and started yelling at them but they told me that if I loved my ex I would have cried. Now that I am alone I'm thinking if they were right and that I never loved her. So AITA?

Edit: I know that I'm TA for telling her the bad things and I tried to apologise but the problem is AITA for no crying."	14	15	0.75

My parents divorced when I was an infant and I did not see them after that. Well until recently. 

It wasn’t until I was almost in my 20’s that I finally met my dads family. I had a lot of therapy session in preparation as well as afterwards to help me sort through my feelings. I Know that his family was not entirely to blame for being absent in my life, however I know that they are not innocent either. I also know it would mean a lot to my dad. This is why I was willing to meet them. 

It has since been a few years since I met them and while I have a nice relationship with them, it feels like I am an outsider being invited in... I mean I pretty much am.

However, for the past couple years my father has been asking me every now and again to call his family my family, particularly for me to call his parents grandma and grandpa. He said they it would mean so much to them and that they are old so don’t have a lot of time left. I know it would make all of them very happy… but I don’t want to. 

I do care for them and like spending time with them, I really do! But after almost 20 years of no relationship, almost 20 years of my most developmental parts of life, They just don’t feel like my grandparents. I know biologically they are my grandparents but emotionally? No. They weren’t there when I was little. I have no childhood memories of them because there were none. I never had traditions with them, and while I’m added to them now, I feel out of place. I hear stores from my dads nieces and nephews about their childhood with my dads parents, and I feel like an outsider watching a family. I watch them interact so naturally and have so many stories and know so much about each other, and I don’t have that with any of them. And it is far too late to change that. They aren’t my grandparents. They are my dads parents who are nice to me and care about me (now at least). 

Where I might be the AH is that i have so much found family- people that i consider family that I am Not related to and did not grow up with- that I have no issues considering as family and even calling them my parents/ sister/ brother. 

But this just feels different and the idea of pretending makes me uncomfortable. They left me when I was a baby, they chose to walk away and not fight for a relationship. So I feel like I have the right to choose what kind of relationship I have with them now and what I call them. Even if it’s hurts them that it’s not what they want. 

TL;DR Dads parents were absent since I was a baby until I was almost an adult. After 5 hrs of a relationship they want me to call them my grandparents but I feel uncomfortable calling them that."	93	57	0.89

I'm 17M in my senior year of highschool. This happened in my Science class with a male teacher. 

My teacher and I haven't really gotten along all year to be completely honest. I already have enough science credits to graduate, I'm just taking this class since I was pushed into it by my school, so it's a class I don't take too seriously. 

I've never been rude or anything but I think he can tell there's a lack of effort, plus I've skipped the class a few times. So he always gets mad at me over the smallest things that he'd let other students get away with easily. 

The problem:

Today in class my friend and I were in the same group and we were completing an ""experiment"" type assignment. I won't bore you with the details but basically we were using liquids and glass beakers for it. 

We were doing all the work and completing the questionnaire assigned to us, but we were also joking and messing around. Nothing too disruptive I don't think, but yk we're high school guys and we were making jokes and such while doing the work. 

Long story short, my friend and I were talking and I jokingly pushed him, not with a lot of force just kind of pressed an arm into him. He jokingly overreacted to my push and kind of swung his arm around, which ended up knocking over a glass beaker and breaking it. 

As soon as my teacher heard it fall and break he practically ran over to us and asked who did it. I said it was me because I didn't want my friend to get in trouble. 

Well my teacher got up in my face and started yelling at me. He didn't just say ""go to the office"" he completely went off on me and I'm pretty sure he let a couple swears slip too. 

He was pissed off, red in the face, just screaming at me in the middle of the classroom. I ended up kind of yelling back at him, but I tried to stay calm at first, saying stuff like ""it's not a big deal,"" ""I'll clean it up,"" etc.

But he kept going on and on and eventually I just go so tired of it I told him to ""shut the **** up"" really loud, then left the room to try and calm down. 

I feel like I might have gone too far but he was screaming in my face for a minute or two straight and I just got fed up. I lost my cool, I'll admit that, but idk if I'm totally in the wrong here.

That was my last period so I haven't spoke to a principal or anything but I assume I'll have to tomorrow and now I'm worried I might be suspended over it and I'm kind of freaking out. I regret yelling but at the same time I feel like he caused the issue to begin with.

They broke up due to a disagreement regarding moving in together after Dan’s senior year, which Macy has recounted to me a couple times over the last week as she cried and moaned about the relationship. The deal was, it’s Macy’s junior year and Dan’s senior year, and he brought up moving in together after he graduates and living together during Macy’s senior year. The issue apparently was that Macy already renewed her lease with her current apartment and is locked in until the end of her own senior year. This caused some tension, as he tried to sway her into breaking her lease and moving out early (I was home to hear some of this). She refused due to the terms of breaking the lease (mainly the money she has to pay and how she has to find someone to sublease until her agreement is up) but Dan offered to take care of that for her. 

Apparently she continued to tell him no, that she’d prefer to wait until her lease is up to move, and Dan let up after a couple weeks and agreed to wait. This led to a whole other argument, though, because when they started to discuss where they would move and what their plans were, Macy said she wanted to rent a 2 bedroom because she “needs her own personal space”. Dan didn’t like this because obviously sharing a 1 bedroom is cheaper for both of them and he wants to share a bed with her because THEY’RE DATING. Macy insisted on a 2bed, and this led to Dan asking her how she expects them to progress towards or prepare for marriage if she won’t even share a bed with him. She shot back with how even while married she would want her own personal space, and Dan broke up with her on the spot saying this would never work for him.

Honestly, I’ve run out of sympathy for Macy. When she whined about it again Friday night I finally told her “yeah, well, it’s kind of on you here.” And Macy blew up on me instantly asking how it could possibly be her fault. I told her Dan gave her every opportunity to make this an easy and smooth experience and she kept pushing and arguing and making excuses, so yes, it’s her fault that he got pissed off and broke things off with her. She went into her room after that and hasn’t spoken to me since, but some of our mutual friends have sent me rude messages because Macy told them (probably an altered version) what happened. Now I’m starting to wonder if I’m in the wrong here. All I did was tell her the truth."	557	367	0.86

This past weekend, I had a guest tell me that he had a dog w/ him. My hotel is not pet friendly, which means that we only allow service dogs. This is how the conversation ensues:

Me: ""Our hotel is not pet friendly, so we only allow service dogs. Is your dog a service dog?""

Guest: ""Yes""

Me: ""What service does it provide?""

Guest: ""Support... like emotionally""

Me: ""Okay, so an Emotional Support Animal?""

Guest: ""Yes""

Me: ""Ok sir, so ESAs do not have the same rights as SDs. Our hotel is not pet friendly, so we only accept SDs, not ESAs""

Guest: ""Well, I've stayed here before and it's never been an issue! This is the first time I've heard of this""

I ended up just honoring it for this time, and informed him that he needed to disclose the fact that he was bringing a dog w/ him when making the reservation (which is standard for ANY hotel because there is usually a fee applied for pets).

I am still new at this hotel, but have prev. experience in hotels. My prev. property was within a park so I had to deal w/ people bringing in their pets all the time. In order to go about things in the right way, I have done my own research on this subject multiple times and these are my findings (please correct me if I am wrong):

1. SDs are allowed in all public spaces. The only time you can tell someone w/ a SD that they need to remove the SD is if it’s not housebroken or 'out of control.'

2. SDs usually wear a vest that says they are a SD, although it’s not required. If it’s not clear that a dog is a SD, there are only 2 questions you can ask a SD handler: ""Is that a SD?"" and ""What work or task has it been trained to provide?""

3. Emotional Support Animals do not have the same rights as SDs. They have rights when it comes to housing and air travel, but not in hotels/lodging.

My coworkers didn’t  know the proper policies regarding SDs. One said that we need to get proper documentation, and others said that we were not even allowed to ASK a guest if it’s a SD/what task it was trained to do because of HIPPA.

The next day that my manager came in, they said that some people can get 'triggered' if it’s a sensitive subject (like if someone has one as the result of a traumatic event). I kind of understand what they mean, but that is the purpose of the vest. Like the law says on the [ADA.gov](https://www.ada.gov/topics/service-animals/) website, a SD is not legally required to wear the vest, but as a business, we still reserve the right to ask those two questions if it’s not obvious what the dog is and why it's there.

I have never had an issue w/ real SDs and their handlers. They usually disclose that they have a SD when making a reservation (which is not an obligation but FD agents appreciate) or come in w/ the SD at check-in, so we can see that it’s clearly a SD.

(25 f). 

In January 2022, My soon to be ex husband and I came to the agreement that our marriage wasn’t working, so I moved out of the apartment, and back in with my parents for a little while.

In March I met someone who I am still with and super happy with. My ex is also in a relationship, so I guess everything was good for the both of us.

In April I found out I was pregnant.

In July I moved in with my boyfriend.

In December I had our baby.

Now the fun begins:

Last week I heard from my ex. He asked me if we could do our taxes together. I said no and gave him the reasons why.

Reason 1: I feel like I don’t have to since I wasn’t living with him and haven’t  for most of the year of 2022 except for 15 days of that year.

Reason 2: I don’t want any issues for me in the future after having a baby that isn’t his and have her on our tax return if we were to file jointly. Especially if my boyfriend decided to claim her one year once his name can go on the birth certificate. I’ve been advised by several people to also not file together because it could hurt me in the future.

Reason 3: Our divorce is almost finalized. Can’t wait.

For record this was a terrible marriage. It was always one sided, and if he didn’t get his way, he’d act out and guilt trip me, and I’m not dealing with it again.

With that said he asked me four more times on different days. Begging. He said he calculated it and it said he’d owe $700 and that I’d owe a crazy amount too. So I asked my tax guy (my boyfriend’s dad) how much exactly I’d owe. He said roughly $35. So I told my ex that I’d barely owe and stated again why I don’t want to. Then he said that my boyfriend could just claim her and I could claim her next year. I said no, I was planning on claiming her. He then says for my boyfriend to claim her, while also calling my baby an “it”, while giving me a sob story about how he was going to use his return for when he goes to Puerto Rico. Again, I told him no and he told me I was being selfish and that he wasn’t going to take my money. He said that he shouldn’t have to pay that much money while I get to pocket it. It’s not about the money for me. It’s about my concerns regarding future tax returns and how it could end up biting me in the butt one day AND I simply just don’t want to. I told him I didn’t feel like I was being selfish. Not only that but his problems are no longer my problems. 

AITAH?

EDIT**
I was never considering filing as single, because I can’t. I was going to file as married filing separate.

Neither him or I have a lawyer. We figured since we shared no marital assets, no children, and do not want alimony that either him or I filing for absolute divorce would be best. So, I filed for that.

In my state, the baby is not looked at as his since he is not on the birth certificate. I am the only person on the birth certificate. The hospital advised me to do this to avoid my baby being looked at as my exes when she isn’t. However, that means my boyfriend could not sign it either. So technically on the birth certificate, it’s seen as “I don’t know who the father is” even though I do. That’s just how it is for my state, I am not sure about the others. So once the divorce is finalized I can either wait 9 months, show the vital records office the affidavit of parentage and have my boyfriend put on the birth certificate or get married, and I wasn’t going to get married under those circumstances, so we have to wait 9 months after the divorce has been finalized.

ANOTHER EDIT**
Thank you all for your reassuring comments that how I feel is right and not me being unreasonable or selfish. I have since blocked him because I’m tired of the back and forth, and like most have stated, I shouldn’t have to explain myself, after my first initial no. Let alone explain an additional 4 more times. I’m looking into the recommendations given. I’m aware now that when we file separately we have to both either opt for itemized or the standard deduction. I will have to check into that, but looking at previous tax returns it seems that we had the standard deductions, so I’m thinking it would be the same for this year as well just separately. We both for that year had nothing to really itemize and so standard deduction was always the way to, but like I said I will have to make sure they are both the same. Thank you all for giving me insight on things I knew that verified how I was feeling as well as my thought process, as well as teaching me new things that I did not know about prior. Thank you everyone!"	152	62	0.93

I was in college and had a group of 3 friends, Anna(me), Bella and Cinderella. One more classmate Debby, was an introvert, overly sensitive and entitled girl.normally ABC do everything together because,they lived in the same dorm. When we went out for anything, three of us would go together and Debby never cared about it until one day. During a Christmas trip, we planned to go out without Debby because Bella had some conflicts with her she told us Debby shows up, she won't. Fast forward when we posted photos of the trip, Debby bombarded me,only me with texts and voice messages asking why we didn't invite her and if we were enjoying without her. When I went back, everyone asked why I made Debby cry. I felt like a boyfriend cheating with 2 other girls, all imaginary. Apparently she was crying Infront of all classmates even professors involved. 

The protagonist, Debby was getting a lot of attention along with us, I guess she was happy but we were criticized as hell for not caring about her.She apologized, but Bella and Cinderella were still pissed at her. Despite this, they still don't like her and she tries to be in contact with them. Recently, a memory of the Christmas thing came up and we were reminded of all the other instances where we had to deal with her especially me since for some reason she always targeted me. They were wondering if we should cut off the relationship, but we need someone's opinion who is not involved in this. 
When this happened I,Anna was 22, Bella was 27, Cinderella was 25 and Debby was 28. So in case anyone wondering why no body liked her behaving childishly."	3	8	0.67

I (27M) am quite close to my grandparents, we see each other every week or two for a dinner at their place when I’m in my hometown. I love talking to them, and my grandmother is one of the closest people I have

The problem is, when we have dinner at their place, my grandfather is the loudest chewer I have ever seen. You can hear the food being digested and chewed in his mouth, almost as if he was making love to that chicken he’s devouring. It genuinely makes me sick to my stomach, and I just can’t hold the conversation or think while that’s going on in front of me

Now, he does not do that when we are in restaurants, or with the rest of my family so he is definitely capable of not eating loud. 

Normally, asking to just keep it civil is a no-brainer, but a few years ago he was being rather obnoxiously loud when I visited them in his villa and stressing out about silly stuff (along the lines of our exact departure time), so I asked him to just be a little quieter and he straight up flipped at me for telling him how to behave in his own home.

I don’t want to trigger, provoke or embarrass him, and I’ve been quiet about this for years, but it’s also objectively ruining the time I spend with them - the moment we’re done with dinner I find a reason to leave because I can’t stand the chewing 

I’ve been considering asking my grandmother to maybe ask him, because she knows him best 

What do you think? Am I being weird about this, or is there another way to handle it?

I'm American, they're from Costa Rica.  I am learning Spanish (yay Duolingo!), but I'm still on the beginner-intermediate level, and certainly not at a level where I can understand native Spanish speakers.  They speak both Spanish and English fluently.  When we're eating at the dinner table, most of the time they are speaking to each other in Spanish.  I've told my girlfriend that when they speak in Spanish with each other, it makes me feel excluded from the conversation.  I would like to be part of the conversation, so that I feel like I'm involved and also have the opportunity to bond with her daughter.

When I told my girlfriend about this, she said that she doesn't want her daughter to lose the ability to speak Spanish. I completely understand that sentiment, but I told her that when her and her daughter are hanging out in her daughter's room and having a mother-daughter talk, that's the perfect time to use Spanish with her. However, I think that when we're all in a common area like the living room or dining room, it would be nice if they used English, so I can be part of the conversation.

She also said that they are just talking about feminine stuff, they aren't talking about me.  I believe that they aren't talking about me.  So my point was that if they want to have a private conversation, they should have it in private, not in front of me in a language I don't understand, so I feel excluded from the conversation.

Am I reasonable for wanting her to use English when they're around me, or should I suck it up buttercup and accept that they speak a language that I don't yet understand?"	27	75	0.75

She couldn't find a job related to what she studied at a colleague, has a toxic relationship with her siblings, her nephew is very rude to her despite raising him as her own son, most of her friends have left our country, and she's going through a difficult economic moment. 

She raised me. I remember her being kind and consenting when I was a child. But when I grew up, I realized she also had a retrograde and derogative mindset. My aunt is a catholic person and has had no shame expressing her dislike for other religions, sexual diversity, and abortion, among other stuff. She's also very critical of other topics I can't recall.

I'm a homosexual man, and she currently doesn't know about my sexuality, therefore, I couldn't help wanting to leave her house when she mentions these themes when we chat. It really makes me feel uncomfortable, and I have told such a thing my mom, but she has said that was my aunt's flaw, and despite that, she genuinely loved me, and I can confirm by myself that my aunt really does.

However, I cannot help feeling bad when she says stuff such as gay men having disgusting sex or that same-sex marriage shouldn't be legalized in our country. Overall, I feel unstable and unsure about her. She has told me she appreciates it when I look her up to chat, but I, at the moment, don't want to. At the same time, I feel like a shitty person, because she's one of my closest family and I still appreciate her, ironically."	18	18	0.82

I (14F), was told by my father figure to ""Stop being a fucking cunt"" last night. Let me explain.

I was starting to get tired, it was 12:02am, and I noticed my brother (10M), was still awake. I went over to him, he was watching something on YouTube on our TV, and I told him it was time for bed. Note that when I started, I was saying it in a joking matter more than in a serious way.

He kept telling me no, and we went back and forth for a bit. It got to the point where we were both running around, him running away from me and laughing some, with me chasing him to try and catch him. Whenever I did catch him, I started pulling him over to the stairs.

We get to the stairs, and he goes dead-weight before curling up into a ball that made it to a point where I couldn't pick him up. I heard one of the couch chairs upstairs be closed, signifying someone was coming over to the stairs to see what was going on. I could hear my mom snoring from her room.

I told my brother again that it was time to go to bed, and before he responded, my dad's voice from the top of the stairs said ""Hey, stop being such a fucking cunt."" Obviously, I didn't include my name which was said for privacy reasons, and to not give to much person/private information out.

I paused, and stood there for a few seconds before running off to my room, and slamming my door closed as hard as I possibly could. A minute or two later, my door opened again, and it was my dad trying to say more to me.

""You don't put your hands on your brothers, at all. If you want to put your hands on someone, put them on me, someone who's bigger than you. You don't touch your brothers, period."" My dad had said before he closed my door again.

I, at this point, had already sent a message to my friend saying that he had called me such as above. I finished my paragraph as to what had happened. After I sent over the message, I locked my door, and sent three messages to my mom in paragraphs explaining what had happened. I've gotten a response from my friend, who has told another friend of ours and needless to say they want to come over to my house.

Before a went through the motions of blocking and deleting my father figures number, I had texted my friend that I want to move back to where we used to live a little over a year ago. Thankfully, I was able to talk with a few friends just generally, not about what happened, before I went to bed.

I know that putting my hands on my brother was wrong, and that I shouldn't have done so. I know I should have left everything up to my mom or my father figure, but I knew I was tired, and there was no way I was going to let him stay up for longer, even if it is the weekend now.

I understand that I'm in the wrong, and that I'd be the asshole for that. I've talked with my friends, and they all say that my father figure is the asshole here. I still need to know though, am I the asshole in general? Am I the asshole for blocking and deleting my father figures phone number in my fit of rage?

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE - I talked with both of my parents, and I unblocked and put a contact back for my father figure.

Yesterday, I talked with my mom, and she had said that she talked with my dad as soon as she had woken up the morning after. Overall, she didn't think her saying anything would do much, and that by me talking with my father figure might do more since it's coming from the direct person of his fowl language. She said that when she did talk with him, it was entirely unacceptable for him to have said that, and that he should never had said that, it was disgusting he ever did, and that it would affect our relationship.

I talked with him today, maybe 20mins. ago, and told him that what he said hurt me. I told him our relationship had changed, that I found it unacceptable that he used that word. I explained that I realized I was wrong for trying to force my brother to go to bed, that I was wrong for putting my hands on him, but it still wasn't okay that he had called me as listed above. His response will be written out as I remember it.

""Okay, I'm sorry that I used that word/language, I shouldn't have done so. Have you apologized to your brother yet for what you did?""

""No, I haven't apologized yet.""

""Okay, what that tells me is that you find it more important to come and talk with me about this, than talk with your brother about you pulling him around.""

""I can go talk with him about that once we're done.""

""Okay, cool.""

I started getting emotional, so I walked out. Behind me I could see my mom walking over to my dad, obviously about to talk with him. I came downstairs, talked with my brother and told him I was sorry, and got some input.

I asked him if he felt that we had been rough-housing, or if he felt it was something else. He said, and I quote, ""It was more forcing me trying to go to bed, and rough-housing. It was a mix between."" I asked my brother if he had felt any pain whenever I had been pulling him around gently, and he said he felt none. He even told me that it was fun what we were doing, he claimed that it was *fun*.

I told my friends, who I had already been on the phone with, about what had just happened. They both agreed together that my father figure was using me not apologizing to my brother as a deflection tool.

My mom came down a few minutes later, crying, telling me that she had talked with my father figure, bringing up different things, and it didn't seem to have any affect at all. She told me that she was sorry, that his language was fowl, and should've never been, and that it was horrendous that he had even been thinking these things.

She was obviously extremely upset on my behalf, especially on the fact that he didn't seem to change his mind about any of it. I was more so upset that he felt the need to say that me not apologizing to my brother was more important than me coming to talk with him about his language and what he called me.

I wish I had a better update to give, an update where I maybe got at least a better apology, or maybe something besides for this. Unfortunately, this is what I have. My friends are on my side, my mom is on my side, I will no longer be talking with my father figure unless it is absolutely necessary on my terms. I wish I could give something better, but this is what I have."	8	93	0.6

Before he got a girlfriend, he would hang out with us and it would be fine for the most part. I will admit I was excited when he got a girlfriend because he would linger around and it would be hard to do couple stuff. A few weeks ago us and our larger friend group all went out for dinner. This was my first time meeting his new girlfriend who we will call Cat. I think she is 19. 

Anyways, cat did not say a single word the entire time. We barley could get her to talk, and she would walk away from the rest of us. She seemed super uncomfortable. I thought maybe since it was her first time meeting us that was the issue, but we saw her again for a friends birthday and it was the same thing. She did not attempt to talk to us at all, she sat far away from the girls and didn’t want anything to do with us. Since E is close with my bf and I he suggested just the four of us all hang out and maybe that all help her open up. 

I really don’t want to, I feel uncomfortable with trying to force this person to like me. I felt rejected by her, and feel hanging out with her will just prove troublesome and give me anxiety. My bf wants me to go because this was important to E that we could all get along, it’s something they talked about a long time ago. They dreamed of doing double dates, and now it’s possible. I don’t want to crush their dreams but this girl isn’t social and I don’t know how to get her to like me. E and my boyfriend are really sad about this, and i’m thinking maybe I am the asshole and I should just try to hang out with her again."	28	36	0.85

We wanted to get a place as close to the stage as possible, It was a Thursday so we all had classes and some of them had work or internships in the afternoon, the gates to enter the place the show would be set at were supposed to open at 4p.m so me and my friend N decided we were going to leave class early and go to the line, since we didn't had work and the others did, we got there at 10a.m, it was 30 degrees Celsius and the sun was right at our faces the entire time, there wasn't any space where we could sit properly or support our backs, they were selling water by 3 times the normal price and there was no food, so it wasn't a good experience me and my friend god dehydrated and got insolation.

By around 2p.m they changed the time the gates were supposed to open to 5p.m so more time in the sun with our feet and ass killing us with no water.

By around 4:30p.m our friend V came and joined us in the line, by 4:40p.m my other friends H and K texted us saying they would be late so if they opened the gates we should let the people behind us go before us until they arrive.

Me and N thought this was really unfair to us since we were waiting for hours to get good places in that hell and they wanted to not only get inside without trouble but also make us loose our places, we told them we wouldn't do that and we didn't.

We got in 10 minutes before they arrived and the place was already starting to get full fast (there ware more then 43k people going to the show)
They eventually found another friend of H in the line and got in with him relatively fast, just not as fast as we did so we were more close then them. 

We all enjoyed the show and I thought this would be the end of the problem but yesterday, H and K completely ignored me the hole day, and today was the same, they didn't even looked at me and that hurt a lot bcs I'm nore close to them then to the others, I considered us to be really good friends, so I decided to ask H if she was mad at me and she said:

""no, but I didn't like what you did, I thought it was a lack of consideration and respect, you could have waited for us, we literally arrived about 5/10 min after you"" 

I answered back by saying that I didn't think what they asked was fair with us and how that made me feel used.

She answered back with a ""ok"" and didn't look at me the rest of the day.

That and others small things she did,  like things we alweys did together just the two of us she asked other people to do with her in front of me, really hurt me and had to get out of class to go cry in the bathroom.

I don't get what I did wrong, and why I'm being treated like that, I'm really scared that if I don't fix it they will stop being my friends and talking to me."	19	15	1.0

 a little background i (55M) have been dating my gf (58F) “tamy” for the past 8 years and we have been living together the past 7. tammy has two kids from her previous marriage (22;25 F). they both live together about 30 minutes away from us. i don’t have a great relationship with the girls but i think that’s due to the fact i don’t see them often/ we do not live together but they are always nice to me and i am to them. they are however very close with their mom and they speak at least 3 times a week.
recently i had a knee replacement and tammy has been taking care of me during my recovery. (making me meals, getting me my meds, making coffee, taking me to the doctor etc). well i’m having a hard time recovering after the surgery and am in a lot of pain. now neither tammy or i are very handy when it comes to maintenance. i have a great handy man who i call who fixes dishwasher, plumbing or whatever. anyway the past couple of days we’ve been having trouble with the main toilet. (we have 2 bathrooms). i told tammy that until Mark (the handy man) can come look, to not flush anything down the toilet. i told tammy she can pee in the main toilet but everything else needed to be done in the other bathroom to prevent a flood. well today i’m sitting on my chair relaxing and i hear tammy yell oh no. i go ask her what’s wrong and see that she flushed toilet paper down the main toilet. it started a whole mess in the bathroom and flooded the toilet. i then started to yell at her because she didn’t listen to me. i told her she was being irresponsible and not listening to me. she said she was stressed from the past few days and she asked what she was supposed to do with the tissue from wiping and i said to just throw it in the trash can next to the toilet. she told me i said she can pee in that toilet and started to get upset with me yelling at her. she then left the house. leaving me to cook dinner on my own with my bad knee. 
i was feeling some type of way so i called her two daughters to discuss the situation. when i called danielle (22f) she and her sister were together eating dinner. when they answered i started they needed to talk to their mother and get her in line. i said that she and i had a fight and they needed to talk to her about it. i told them what had happened and said that their mother was out of line and that she just left and i don’t know what to do. i told them tammy was being impossible. they told me that i was being an AH and it was inappropriate for me to call them to discuss her. tammy came home about an hour later and was pissed i called her daughters to talk about her. she also said i was an AH. so AITA?"	24	39	0.63

For context, we live on a farm and my husband was working on something, my 4 year old son loves to hang out with his dad outside and dig dirt and whatnot. 

Well when my husband was working outside he called me(I was inside as he was watching our son) and told me essentially he lost our son and it was my fault because he was working, but me and my daughter both heard him agree to watch him and he was watching him for around 30 minutes before this call. 

Anyway, me and my daughter both ran outside to look for him and he was just in the barn we own, he was fine and as soon as we got out we found him. 

When me, my daughter and husband and son went back inside me and my husband and I got into an argument where he basically blamed me for freaking out and leaving my son with him while he was working. 

Our daughter backed me up in this fight and told him he agreed to watch our son. 

My daughter suggested I’d post here for some unbiased opinions. 

Anyway, AITA for being upset that my husband lost our 4 year old and essentially freaking out about it.


Edit: I was inside during this time doing housework and my job and simultaneously talking with my daughter about feminine things, I have more then one child who needed my attention:)"	380	112	0.93

I'll be keeping things vague enough because I know some people involved read stuff on reddit from time to time and don't want it to become more of a crap storm than it already is. Anyways, here are the people, fake names of course. 

Me - Early 20s, suspected to have aspergers.  
Bradley - Early teens, my cousin and suspected to be a narcissist.   
Bradley's Friends - Early teens, three of them, I don't really know anything about them.

To help people get an idea of things, we live in a pretty poor area and as such, we're more focused on keeping food on the table and a roof over our heads than anything else. We know that there is very, very likely something mentally wrong with each of us but sadly we just can't afford the luxury of paying to go figure all of that out at the moment.   
Added notes: We live with my dad because we have no other family nearby and NEED each other just to avoid being homeless. We can't afford rent if it was just one of us.

Anyways, to the actual story. Bradley has their friends staying the night over and because we don't have that much food in the fridge and cupboards, I decided to shout lunch for everyone by going down to the local fish and chip shop. I was counting out the money and decided to get me and my dad $10 worth of chips, which would last us a couple of days. Bradley and their friends were given a cash limit of $20 collectively because $5 each is plenty enough to get a burger and some chips here. 

We get to the shop, I make my half of the order and when I ask for Bradley's order, they start ordering way above their limit. What they wanted totalled up to roughly $40. I told them I couldn't afford it so what do they do? They start trying to force me to pay for it, starting with telling me to just pay and when I state flat out that I couldn't afford to spare that much, they result to insulting me. Look, I ain't pretty, but did they seriously have to strike that low?

I gave them one last chance once they had finished insulting me, yet they just double down. I decided that if they were going to act like that, I wasn't going to get them anything. I made the order for just me and my dad and took it home, them complaining the entire way. We got home, they stormed off and locked themselves in Bradley's room. Told my dad, he was amused by it and was on my side though said we should leave the leftovers for them, which I agree with. Might be annoyed with them, but it'd just be cruel to let them starve. They'd just have to deal with cold chips and a bit less than what they would have gotten otherwise. 

I asked a few people I knew well enough online. My friends seem to be on my side or at least don't really care all too much either way because they've already heard a bunch of stories about how horrid Bradley can be from time to time. Others though seem to be split 50/50 between deserved and I was a jerk. So, AITA?"	9	9	0.85

I missed 2 weeks of school last month so I've been trying to catch up on the work I missed plus the other work I'm getting. Graduation is coming soon and my parents are constantly on my back to get straight as on my report card. This has been affecting me mentally, and today it got so bad that I ended up having a panic attack in my 1st period class after the teacher made a joke about me not memorizing my presentation. 

I knew I needed to talk to someone so I got a pass to go to the guidance counselor during 2nd period. She asked me what was wrong and I told her about how I was feeling and all the pressure I was under. She asked me how much homework I was getting and I told her a lot, which is the truth. She asked me if I understood most of the subjects I was getting homework in and I said yes. Then, she asked me if I wanted to have a talk with my teachers about giving me less homework and I said I didn't know. She told me to think about it and go back to her office later. 

When I got back to class, my friend asked me if I was okay. I told him about my talk with the guidance counselor and that I was probably going to take her up on her offer. He got mad at me and told me that I shouldn't do that, that my teachers have been nothing but nice to me and I don't deserve special treatment just because I have mental issues. I told him to leave me alone and he did, but I still feel bad about it. 

I know that my mental health should come first, but I don't want to get my teachers in trouble. Would I be wrong if I accepted the guidance counselor's offer to help me?"	6	63	0.8

Now, just before I left I wound up in hospital. I asked my friend to go pack for me and upon arriving home I noticed several items missing. Clothes, nail dip kit (unopened), shoes…

Now, I wouldn’t usually be so fussed but I gave 8 pairs of shoes to her teen daughter, a $170 hoody and $250 dress. To the mom (my friend) I bought various gifts and gave her clothes that I’d bought in Greece that had sentimental value but she loves them and I love her so take it!

My oodie (oversized super thick hoodie) that my partner bought me was also missing.

So, she borrowed most of the missing outfits and ‘loved’ them but I made it clear I wasn’t giving them to her as they were all brand new, some being gifts from my partner.

I’m being told I’m being ‘gnarky’ for wanting my stuff back because they look really good on her and her man loves her in them.

So i (25M) have my air-conditioner running nearly the entire time these days. Before I can share further, here's some background on our housing, which is very important to the issue at hand:

Me and my family live in a building with two floors, each housing two apartments. It should be noted that my dad played a major role in the building's construction, building two apartments for my family. As such, my family lives on the first floor, while my father allowed his brother (my uncle) and his family (wife, two kids - 8M, 14M) to move into the second apartment on the upper floor. However, since our first floor home doesn't have an extra room, I was allotted a personal room in my uncle's apartment - hell, even the electricity connection for my room is shared with the house downstairs.

Now onto what happened:

Yesterday, I let my little cousin (14M) sleep in my room in my bed at the request of my dad since it was pretty hot in the rest of my uncle's house (yes they don't have an AC). But his tossing and turning kept me from getting a wink, especially since the bed is small for two - and these kids keep growing. 

What's more, I usually like to sleep naked for some comfy nut-and-butt ventilation. Yes, I love my privacy more than anything else. I also tend to stay up late gaming or with the lights on and don't want the kid's sleep to be disturbed. So with that in mind I decided to not let him sleep over, even after his mom (my aunt) insisted she could lay down a mattress on the floor for him to sleep on.

This agitated her, and she went on a tirade about how I invite my friends for sleepovers but I can't let my own cousins sleep, and that I should ask my dad to build me a new room downstairs since her kids ""also deserve a room of their own"". And I quote ""This is my house, so the next time I see you bring your buddies over else I'll ensure all your stuff here is moved downstairs"".

Now, the reason I think I'm TA because I know how bad the heat has been lately so I may come across as being selfish here. I didn't give her a reason as to my refusal either, I just said that I don't wanna. On the other hand, my aunt's statements and attitude make me feel my stance is deserved. I should say this is not the first time she has thrown a tantrum over this stuff so I decided to let it go. Although I have a feeling she's making a bigger fuss now since my parents are out of town on a trip and won't be back for a few days.

Now a few questions you may have:

* Why doesn't uncle have an AC?
They don't earn much so they are frugal spenders. Although that didn't stop them from buying a cheap but decent smart TV heh.

* Have the kids slept in your room before?
Yes. I have allowed them in the past, to my discomfort. But this is the first time I have decided to tackle the situation instead of letting it bother me."	13	15	0.88

1) First and foremost, I am just not ready to be around hundreds of grieving people that aren't family. I am still grieving myself and I am so anxious about the speeches and just saying goodbye. I know that all these people cared for my cousin and I so appreciate that but I guess I'm not ready to face it. 

2) I already went home and dropped everything including work previously and was there to support my family during the roughest moments

3) I would have to fly in late Friday due to work and home at 7 am on Sunday. It would be about 11 hours of flight time to be home for 29 hours.

I absolutely loved and adored my cousin and I want to say goodbye to her in some way, I'm just not sure the funeral is where is best for me to grieve. My parents already said they would not be upset if I didn't come home and completely understand given the above. But WIBTA if I didn't attend my cousin's funeral?"	34	16	0.95

I'm 19f, I work 4pm to 2am, it's factory work. I, like many, enjoy a smoke when I get home before I get my chores and shit done. I normally sleep from 6am to 12pm, so anywhere between half 2 and 3am, I step out for a smoke. 

We don't have a key for the front door, and the back door is really loud when it opens, so I've been climbing out the window. My mother knows, she works 7am to 3pm, so she's asleep when I'm doing this and my sister is still in school. I don't want to wake them, so the sitting room window is the best option. 

This, however, turns on my neighbours porch light, which apparently bothers her. She's never a sleep at this hour, she's unemployed and I can hear her on vioce calls all night most the time. Her bedroom is right beside mine because of how the houses are built. Her window is always open, and her lights are always on. The porch light doesn't cause dogs to start barking or anything like that. 

She's complained before about the smell of weed going into her room, so starred standing in my porch instead of on the path, and she stopped complaining after that. It's the light that bothers her mainly. 

So tonight, I stood out for a smoke, and she came out and started giving out about her porch light, to which I said you can disable that or switch it off the at mains like my family have done, or she can leave me alone and let me relax. That wasn't good enough though because about 10 minutes later, two police officers approached me. I don't live in a legal country, but my local police couldn't give a shit. They said they received a call about it, and said to just put it out or smoke inside. 

But the fact its bothering her so much she decided to call the police on me for smoking makes me wonder if I'm being an asshole and unfriendly neighbour to her?"	12	31	0.87

Everyday my dad will drive me and my brother to school. Staring with dropping off my brother first. For some background info recently me and my dad relationship is rocky as we constantly argue with each other for the dumbest things, like how I don’t smile enough, or I have a attitude, or just being on my phone. Also I have this skin condition where some areas of my body naturally darkens and becomes “dirty” as my parents describes it. It can be kinda solved by putting cream on it but I ran out and last time I took my dads cream it turned to a argument.

So I was in my car at the parking lot of my brother school and I asked to stay in, usually I walk with my brother to school but that day was cold so I didn’t feel like it. And once again my dad was being sulky and saying “ok I guess but your making me loose gas” and he turned to me and said “ you didn’t clean your face. your lip is dirty. Clean it” and left. That wasn’t the first he said it so I wasn’t shock but still offended since I had washed my face and the part of my lips is one of the areas my skin condition affects. So obviously I didn’t really clean much also I’m in the car so I couldn’t really do much either.

After he came back he said “did you clean the side of your neck.” And out of confusion I said “why are you telling me something different” then he replied “ did you do it though” and I said no. Then he tells me to do it and  I refused  saying “ now why are you telling me something else like no I’m not going to do it” and he said “ I just don’t want you looking ugly out of the house “ and I took that personal since my neck is also one of the part where my skin condition is at. So I said idc and I’m not going to “wash my neck” and all of sudden he starred throwing a tantrum. He starred hitting the car,the wheel, the drinks, and his hat. Then he proceeded to yell at me telling me how he always tried to talk to me nicely and how he wants good things for me and how my attitude towards him is bad and he sick of me. And instead of taking me to school he speeds all the way back home turns off the car and leaves me there going back home while I’m stuck in my school uniform crying in the car. I ended up calling my sister to take me to school and she does and I end up going to class with my eyes red and puffy. He blames me and makes me the bad guy when I’m done being the “bad guy” and being left out and yelled for trying to make him happy. 

I haven’t talked to him a lot I mostly only talk to him if I need something but pretty much now he just my dad who lives in the same house as me.

So AITA for refusing to clean my neck?"	7	7	0.78

Took Saturday, Sunday, and Monday to do so. My daughter doesn’t have her license because she just wouldn’t study for it no matter how hard my wife and I tried to get her to. She had to get the car put in my name, get it tagged, and get insurance until she could get her license. 

My wife and I told her to not let anyone drive it due to the fact that if she got into a wreck or one of her friends drove it and wrecked then it would all fall back on my wife and me. We would be responsible for any and all damages, hospital bills, and other such things involved. She promised that the car would sit outside her house and no one would drive it, especially any friends.

After dropping it and her off we handed her the keys and we stayed once more that no one should drive the car for those reasons and she promised once more that no one would. Not even 6 hours later, she has a friend come to her house and they drive it to his place. (She had let HIM drive the car.) 

This guy had just previously been in a wreck with my daughter in his car which injured both of them. They both received money in the insurance settlement, which is what she used to buy the car. After finding out that she not only moved the car from the property it was at but also let her friend drive it and her to his house, I got in my vehicle and went to his house. I asked to speak to my daughter, told her to hand me the key to the car. 

Understandably, she got upset but she not only broke her promise to her mother and me but allowed a person who was recently involved in a wreck to drive it clear across town with neither technically owning the vehicle. I got the key from her, immediately went and canceled the registration and insurance, printed a bill of sale, made her sign the bill of sale, then handed her the key back. 

The boy and his mother were standing on the porch and I tried to be nice ( my daughter said I had scared him for some reason) tried to apologize for scaring him, and he wanted to act all tough about it so I laughed it off and while walking away his mom starts cursing at me. 

I immediately turn around and say that I believed that the boy was renting the house, didn’t know that she was the one who was the property owner, and that I’m sorry but asking to speak to my daughter was really none of her business. Then I walked away.

Now my daughter is upset with her mother and I because of all that transpired, has told her mom off, tried doing the same with me, and stopped us from being able to contact her. Did any of this make me the a*hole?"	50	74	0.8

It’s really important that I mention here that my dad doesn’t own the house, his girlfriend does, but my dad pays half the bills, is paying for renovations and it’s his registered address. 

I stayed over for a long weekend, and this was my second visit since they moved in over Christmas. I live 70 miles away in my dads old house where we had lived as a two since 2014 with my boyfriend which we bought off him before this move. 

My mum and dad divorced when I was very young, nothing traumatic but this of course still comes with the baggage. I don’t have a particularly close bond with my mum, I consider my dad my main single parent. My dad has been with his girlfriend for upwards of 15 years. 

I generally really like her, we are on very good terms with each other, and beside the odd weird comment we don’t tend to ever have any issues. Likewise, my little sister is great. 

My dad over the years of me growing up spent most weekends at her old house, which I would sometimes go as well and stay in the box room but as I got older this died down. Eventually my boyfriend moved into our house with my dad and my dad would stay at his girlfriends for weeks at a time. 

Back to the present, I had a very lovely trip at the new house this weekend as we had so much fun and I was really enjoying the feeling of being in a family home. 

I took a picture of the house and posted it on my social media on the last night saying I had a great weekend at my dads house. To my surprised, that evening I received a passive aggressive text message from his girlfriend in another room which went along the lines of ‘I’m glad you like my house. This is my house which I’m lucky to own. See you again soon good night’ 

I had a huge panic attack and replied that I was sorry and only captioned it that way as to not upset my mum, and that I loved her house and was grateful to stay there. This is partly a lie, I mainly called it that without thinking as I was just so happy to be with my dad. 

This upset me as I’m already quite insecure about this. I didn’t go on the house viewings with the three of them, I don’t have my own room like my sister and instead sleep in a generic spare bedroom, I barely spend any time there and there’s minimal evidence of me in the house. 

I feel really sad as I felt like I was included over this weekend and that I had somewhere to call a family home, and my caption on social media honestly was written in 10 seconds and I didn’t put any deep thought into it. I know it’s not my dads and I know I’m a guest. I feel really unwelcome at the house now and cried all the way home. 

I’m worried that IATA and it’s ok if I am. I’ve already deleted the post and gone home as planned.

Nothing was said about the day in general until last night when my mother blows up my phone telling me I better “be a good son and find a way to make it work” so I can go spend the whole day with her. Obviously that’s not possible. 

My plan was to work and go to her house afterwards with flowers, card, gift and all and offer her a meal from wherever she wants or I can cook her whatever she likes (this is kind of a tradition). However, after our conversation last night, she blocked me and still has not responded to anything I’ve said to her today and won’t answer calls.

Turns out IATA for thinking my MIL was ill-intended. I mentioned it to my frustration to my wife and she told me as they were saying their goodbyes my MIL told her she was only joking about being paid back for the tickets and my wife thought I already knew this. 

Original post: 

Kind of a quick one.

Flash back a few months and my wife and I were told by my MIL that for FIL's birthday we *were* going to a show, we had no say in the matter. It was one of those where you watch a movie and a live orchestra plays the soundtrack. 

Day of the show comes up and my usual birthday gift to anyone in my extended family is to buy them dinner at a restaurant they choose. FIL picks out a restaurant, a higher end wine bar that both my wife and I really like; it is rather expensive though so instead of footing the bill for the entire dinner, I pay for the wine for the table (MIL included), about $180. 

We go and see said show, and I did enjoy it. Seats were decent, it was a movie I enjoy, and the symphony did a great job.

Afterward, we head back to the same wine bar and I treat FIL to a drink and dessert of his choice. Part of the conversation during this night-cap was MIL talking about how we were going to pay her back for the tickets to said show, tickets we were now informed were $97/ea. I love my FIL, but if I had known the price of admission to his birthday party was going to be $200, I may have scaled back on the wine and dessert.

I haven't said anything to my wife yet, and honestly note sure how I will. But I'm frustrated that we were forced to go to this show by my MIL and then told we owed her for our tickets. WIBTA if I told my MIL I'm not paying her back?

Edit: this is all in addition to $150 my wife already spent on groceries to host his birthday dinner.

Edit 2 to answer some questions and a bit more explanation:
-I know some have said I could have said no, the hard part to that is (and my post probably doesn't make it seem this way so I need to be fair) I actually do love my inlaws and do sometimes have a hard time saying no. I didn't want to say no more for my FIL's sake than turning down my MIL.
-I haven't talked to my wife about it yet because this was just last night and I haven't really had a chance to, but she sees nothing wrong with the request. MIL owes me money from a room reno I did for her a bit ago and my wife casually told my MIL we can just take the cost of the tickets off her tab. 
-I can afford the tickets, the issue is this isn't the first time something like this has happened. When I first met my wife, her parents found out I'm pretty handy, and they got into this cycle of inviting us over for dinner or game night then ""while you're here, can you look at x, help me with y, and fix z?""And it wasn't small things either. Things like changing the water pump on her dad's car, figuring out why the compressor on their AC unit wasn't turning on. Eventually I did have that conversation with (at that time she was) my girlfriend and she talked to her parents that if the requests were going to continue, they needed to offer some sort of compensation, hence the tab from the room reno."	18	21	0.84

She has an on and off relationship with her boyfriend. They are awful for each other and constantly break up. Lilly ends up at my house for a place to stay for a few weeks before going back to his to 'work things out'. She ends up at my place a few weeks later and crashes in the spare room. I feel bad for Lilly as she has never seen what a good relationship looks like. We share the same dad, but my mom remarried a great guy who was a better dad than our bio one. Lilly's mom stayed with our dad, and they would just scream and shout at each other constantly. My wife and I started paying for Lilly to go to therapy, but I am not sure if it is working for her.

Recently, me and my wife had a baby girl, and we converted the spare room to a nursery. She has colic, and our lack of sleep has made us both very irritable. Lilly turned up at our door at around 3 last night, asking for a place to stay, she was very drunk, and had no jacket on and it was freezing outside. I let her in, but told her that she had to take the couch, as we don't have a spare room for her anymore. About 4 hours later, the fire alarm went off, as Lilly had put something in the oven and forgotten about it. It was burnt and we struggled to switch the alarm off. My daughter started crying and my wife and struggled to get her to go back to sleep. I went down and told Lilly to get out and also said some mean things. I called her a cab and she left. She has now told our family, and a few  have reached out to call me TA. I regret saying some of the things I had said, and without the lack of sleep, I wouldn't have said them. I am not sure how to fix the situation, as Lilly has blocked my number. She is still my sister and I am worried for her."	150	38	0.91

I'm 21M in NYC. I am a film student interested in narrative films, mostly comedy and horror. I'm going into my senior year in August. My parents told me they'd be willing to cover rent for me to stay in New York for the summer and not come live at home if I was able to find an internship or a job in my field. This is incredibly generous of them, and I'm truly really grateful that I'm in a position where that's a possibility.

  
I only heard back from one job. It's a Fashion Photography internship at a studio nearby, but it is unpaid. They offered college credit, but I already have the credits necessary to graduate, and I'm more interested in getting something legitimate on my resume. My end goal is to get paid work in film after my senior year, regardless of what it is.

  
After a brief meeting with the owner of the studio, he offered me the job, and I accepted.It has been about a month, and whenever I go into the studio, the less legitimate this organization seems to me. The only person that works at the studio is the person who hired me; there are no other employees. He also lives there, which is not a bad thing, but it's not something I would expect. In addition to this, he sets up the shoots for a publication that he runs, so when I go in, I'm usually filming some models dressed in branded clothing and making workout videos for the publication's social media. He says that ""ideally he wants to get sponsorships,"" and these videos are proof of concept for how he can advertise these brands, but that leads me to wonder how and if the publication makes money in the first place. When there is a shoot, I set up the lights, I'm behind the camera (my own personal camera) and I go home and edit it. This is usually work that would require 3 paid people, and I'm doing all of it for free.  
The one incident that got my spidey senses tingling the most was during a meeting, where he said ""Eventually, the goal is that we \[the publication\] start making money.""

  
Don't get me wrong, it doesn't feel like a scam; it just feels like I'm free skilled labor for his passion project. He's a very kind guy who's super fun to be around and he even cooks lunch for everybody occasionally, but it doesn't feel professional, which is the reason I took this job without pay.  
I don't know what to do, because I don't feel like I'm gaining much other than a few connections, but they're not in the field in which I would like to work. I'm not learning anything because I'm doing work that I already know how to do; I'm just doing a lot more of it.

  
Now, I'm getting pretty close to broke and I just got a cashier job, but with the internship eating time and subway money, I can't decide whether it's worth it to stay for the resume content or just work on saving money. Because I don't have much experience yet, I'm unsure whether this internship will actually benefit me. WIBTA if I quit to focus on my paying job?"	18	16	0.83

I'd like a second (or third, or more) opinion on a situation that happened recently. Also, note that I'm on mobile, there might some formatting issues. Plus, English is not my first language. 

A bit of context: me and my partner of 10 years have been living together for a long time. Things are going great together, but there there are some times where we have disputes about small things like chores. My partner has an ADD, which means they're not the best in prioritization or time management. I'm not perfect either tbh. 
On my end, I have issues vocalizing my frustration in a constructive way. I try my best to level with them, but sometimes I tend to focus too much on the negative rather than the positive. I'm not yelling or anything, but my body language, occasional lack of words and way to prove my point by stressing on negative repercussions rubs them the wrong way and they end up in tears.

Here's the situation: Earlier this day, my partner said we needed to wash the sheets and I agreed. I was a bit frustrated because of reasons (not related to the situation, but it may have clouded my judgement. I have to work on that), and was tired. I came back home after 11pm, and I found out that the sheets were still in the dryer, not ready yet (we only have one set of sheets). Already frustrated by other events, I was disappointed to find out they started the laundry after 9pm. Washing + drying sheets under 2 hours is very optimistic). I told them it's better to start washing sheets earlier so we can use them after, or wait for the weekend. We had a dispute about this, and I did not thank them for doing other chores while I was out, like taking out the trash and starting the dishwasher. We ended up talking about it yesterday and they ended up in tears after storming out to have a shower.

I came back later to say thanks for the chores as I realized I didn't thank them yesterday, but I'm still torn about something.

Long story short, I found this out, with details, from a childhood friend of mine that I had fallen out of touch with who had gone to school with my wife. My wife had never told me of this happening and represented herself as a ""socially conservative"" woman when I met her.

I don't know if I ever would have chosen to be in a long-term relationship with her if I knew about her past cheating. But I also don't think it's worth splitting up over, especially given that we have a one month-old child together.

Since she isn't the person I thought she was, I've decided to do a paternity test to make sure that I don't end up raising a child that isn't mine.

I was talking to a sauna friend about this and she said that it was wrong of me to not trust my wife and do a paternity test behind her back. I strongly disagree.

At first it was my mother (54F) who received the money on her account. But as soon as I turned 18 in 2022, the money started going to my account. My mother immediately told me to sign a document that would allow her to keep receiving the money on her own account, and when I refused, she yelled at me, and generally tried to guilt trip me into caving in. So I felt like I had no choice. Fortunately, my country’s law didn’t allow it, so I kept receiving the money. Then she told me to transfer the money to her. So I did. But she only allowed me to keep a ridiculously small part of it. (The social pension is around 614 USD, she only let me keep ≈ 25 dollars. Then her final “offer” was 50.) I just want to be independent with my own money. Save for college, my future, etc. Yet she claims that I will only waste it for treats. Yesterday, I had enough. At first I asked her to let me leave ≈75 USD for myself. She said no. So I didn’t send her anything. She called me cruel and greedy. And told me that she is ashamed of my behavior, and that I should be ashamed too. She then told me that this money helped her survive when we were poor… few years ago. Saying that was most likely another attempt to guilt trip me as nowadays, she and my stepfather are prosperous. They buy themselves new cars quite frequently, buy expensive dinners for themselves from time to time, and could afford extensive renovations in our house, purely to make it more aesthetically pleasing. She also claimed that she has to pay bills and my expenses with that money. When I said that I could chip in, and pay for whatever bills I generate, she of course, refused. After shouting at me yesterday, she have been giving me the silent treatment. I don’t know what to do anymore. Am I the asshole?

Edit: I am not American, so US laws don’t apply to me, like many commenters here assumed.

Edit 2: The situation is over. I managed to strike a deal with my mother. I am going to keep a bigger, more fair, cut than before, and I will transfer her the rest to cover the expenses I generate. (bills, groceries, etc.), at least until I still live with her. When I move out she told me that I can keep all of the money for myself. I am back on good terms with her.

Our custody schedule is such that one parent gets one week, then the other parent gets two weeks and then it switches.

I have a two week work vacation in Europe that I was going to leave tomorrow. I have Ben for two weeks but I'm losing one week of it because it overlaps with my trip.

My ex was more than happy to get him for an extra week. On Tuesday, Ben needed emergency surgery to repair a hernia that came out of nowhere. There were a few complications. He's at my house and just barely getting around. 

My ex told me to go on my trip and not to worry about Ben. I'm sure he'll be fine by next week. However I declined and said I'm canceling my trip and will keep Ben for the whole two weeks.

She was mad because she had made plans. She asked me why I was holding onto this and I said she's clueless on how to take care of him after his op. For example, he needs to be given a sponge bath and dressing applied and there is no way in Hell he is going to let Mom give one to him. 

She said Zach can do that. I said no. And that's just not me but Ben too. I said the only compromise is if my 21yo son Aidan (not her son) is willing to do all that. 

She says that I'm being totally unreasonable and I have no reason to ""fear"" her husband. Today I heard from Zach who said he was quite offended that I didn't ""trust"" him after he's been in Ben's life for so long. He said he teaches elementary school!

I said it has nothing to do with trust. Why let him take care of my kid when I can do it myself?"	8	42	0.84

We started talking about a little bit of everything, and then one of them said to me, ""how are you even capable to walk? my goodness, you're so fat!"". Just to clarify, I'm in fact NOT that fat, I'm 5'6 and my weight is 165 lbs. I might not be Bella Hadid but I'm not obese. To that comment I just said, ""I know I'm fat, I'm really trying to get slimmer but it's not that easy"", to which she proceeded to continue calling me fat and saying stuff like ""I bet if someone from high school saw you again, they wouldn't even recognize you"" (I'm 22, finished high school years ago).

I decided not to get mad or talk back to them, until this happened. We finished eating and went to the living room, there were them, my mom and me. my mom started talking about the smell of some flowers, and then the conversation lead to the smell of perfumes. We were talking about J'Adore Dior and I said it made me sneeze because it contains ylang-ylang to which I'm allergic to. When I said that one of them said ""oh, so you prefer perfumes that smell like farts"". My mom and I looked at each other like wtf does that even means. I was already mad for that other previous comment, and this one literally made my blood boil. So I stood up and yelled ""enough"" and then I said I was tired of these comments and told them to please leave. My mom thought I kind of overreacted but understood why I was mad.

I get it is probably hard cause its a 1 sided story and this needs a lot of context, but would be good to get thoughts. Basically I (25M) and getting married, so my partner (25F) and I were looking at venues in Sydney. Only my partner and I are paying for the wedding and its an Indian wedding so expectations were that we would have heaps of guests and we quickly realised not much could be done within our budget. We spent a month stressing and researching every venue and came up with a rough plan with 150 guests max where we would be passing our budget, but out of that 60 people were our friends.   


Our conversation with my parents went really badly - my parents got mad cause they wanted to invite at least 100, and then were really upset that we had ""so many"" friends we were going to invite and they could only invite 50 people. They were critiquing every cost we gave even though we had researched it a bunch and ended up saying I was being selfish for not going over budget to have more guests. To their credit we could spend more on the wedding, my partner and I just felt like the cost is not worth it and we would like to be financially stable after as we'd move out as soon as we'd get married. In addition before I got engaged we did have the understanding I would pay for my wedding and I thought I could afford something decent before I realised how expensive wedding actually were. Also my parents were guarantors on a loan for a property my partner and I got a year ago - not sure if really relevant, just might help with judging me/my parents.  


Following that, my older sister called me (28F) (who lives in london) after my parents talked to her about what I said, and she just started attacking me about how we were inviting so many friends and that I should have more family then friends. She was even saying how I should just spend more and that I should've thought about the cost before I said I wanted to get married. I got really mad cause I felt like no-one in my family cared about me and they just cared about the event - and I couldn't understand why my sister was being aggressive because she barely had any skin in the game, and she didn't even try to empathise. I called her selfish was pretty rude to her (and she was to me) and we sort of hung up on each other.   


Now it's a few weeks later and she's really hurt because I called her selfish even though she has stood up for me in the past. She was crying and I told her I wasn't sorry for anything I said before because I was literally just talking about what I could afford and no one showed me any empathy. My family said I have changed since I got engaged - which I admit I have. I felt like I was just bending over backwards for them, but now I was pushing back where I felt reasonable.  I know this is really long but AITA? Either to my sister or my family?

I've been complaining about this job for months to my parents. My company knew that I had OCD and ADHD but did not accommodate these disabilities nor prevented harassment from co-workers. My parents advised me to send a complaint to the CEO (the company doesn't have HR). As soon as I sent in a complaint, I also started applying for new jobs. After the complaint, the company fired me with out any written documentation, a reason, or offered me severance. 

The day after this happened I drove two hours to visit my parents and take time to decompress. The first day home my mom continuously talked about applying to jobs and my finances. She also suggested five to six times that I apply to the same company, which is two hours away from my apartment. The second day home I woke up around noon because my anxiety woke me up several times that night. I had a headache and neck pain. My mom almost immediately started asking me about finance and started making a plan. I asked (I believe my tone of voice was neutral) ""can we please talk about this tomorrow, I don't feel well. I'm stressed and I would like this to be tomorrows problem."" My mom responded with ""Well maybe the way you just talked to me is the reason you got fired."" My heart sunk. I responded carefully ""If we can't have a good conversation and I am going to feel guilt tripped, then maybe it would just be best if I leave."" She responded my with ""I'm not guilt tripping you. It's the truth and if you didn't talk to people like that then you wouldn't have gotten fired."" 

My dad approached my mom about this comment and asked her to be civil while I was in town. I can help but feeling like a failure. I feel dismissed and broken. I was coming home for support and don't feel like I received it from my mom at least. Hopefully I am not the asshole but if so, I appreciate the honesty."	1	6	0.5

Last time I asked how it’s going with the game (about a month ago) they told me it’s great and that they’re about to start their fifth play through.

My nephew showed me a pic of him with their pup, saying that my brother told him dog toys are unnecessary expenses. The puppy was bored with nothing to play with, so my nephew tried to steal one of my dog’s toys.

I thought about it for a few minutes then told my nephew I’ll pay him if he cleans my living room and then take him to a pet shop so he could buy a puppy chew toy. He agreed and we went to buy a toy that afternoon.

My brother though, was upset when he found out. He said that I should have scolded my nephew, and now my nephew will think he can get away with trying to steal. Was the way I handled the situation wrong? Should I have taken a different approach?"	67	38	0.94

I (25F) have been what you would say 'estranged' from my mom(45F). She hasn't called, messaged or visited my kids and I in almost 2 years, maybe a little longer. Every time I have texted her to see what she was up to on some days, to see if she would want to visit, she would always say she was working, which I can understand. But other times she would say she is busy and can't that day, then I would never hear about it again unless I was the one reaching out to her. After she would say these things, she would be going to the park or to do something else with my niece and sister on her days off or even after work some days.  
A little, maybe not-so-important, backstory: My oldest daughter is 6 years old, turning 7 in November. She wouldn't and did not take me to appointments if I was having car troubles, but would take my sister. She didn't go to my baby shower, but went to my sisters (both of them). She only visited me in the hospital once when I was in there with my oldest. My youngest was born in March of 2021 so, you know, COVID restrictions, so she couldn't come even if she wanted to. With my oldest I had Preeclampsia. My youngest was in the NICU for 5 days because of fluid in her lungs. When I was giving birth, I bled nearly 1 liter of blood. She didn't check on me at all  
ANYWAYS I should have mentioned this would be my moms 3rd marriage. Her first one was to my dad, and the second one to my youngest brothers dad. She forced me to take care of my sister and 2 younger brothers while she went to work or do something and she called it ""Preparing you for parenthood"".  
My mom has asked me to be her MAID OF HONOR. When she asked me this I literally asked ""Why? Why me?""  
She replied: ""For obvious reasons and I would like the girls to be flower girls""  
Again I asked her ""Why?"" followed up with ""Wouldn't you rather ask my sister?""  
She stayed adamant with me being the M.O.H.  
Today, I decided to message her and ask her if she could do me a favor and that I don't want her to take it the wrong way. To make the message short, I told her that if I accept I want her to put more of an effort into a relationship with my family and I. And I expressed how seeing Facebook posts about how she is out having all this fun with my sister and niece, upset me because I find my self questioning Why am i not enough for her to do that with me and my kids? I am a believer in parents should be there for their kids. not the other way.  
She has not replied yet. She left me on read.  
So WIBTA if I decided not to go if she got defensive in her answer, or just didn't reply at all? "	9	18	0.84

We go to different high schools but they are all in town. I was very interested in this girl at my school and she’s my neighbor. For the past year or so I hanged out at her house with her family and we became friends. I liked the girl and my friends knew that. Like a lot. I would talk plenty about her. I invite one of my friends to hangout at my house and we go over to her house. My friend said he would be my wingman. We had fun over at her house but then her and her brother head over to my house with my friend and lay in the backyard. My friend and the girl I like start flirting with each other laying next to each other on the ground. 


Even her brother noticed they were flirting. Fast forward back at my house, my friend follows the girl everywhere around my house and doesn’t once come hang out with me. I’m upstairs trying to get her brother set up on my pc to play the game and they got a movie going in my basement. They are at my house till the early morning (this started at midnight). They leave because they been at my house till almost 5. I get pissed at my friend for flirting with her knowing I liked her for a while. I go to sleep angry. I stopped talking to him a bit after that until he comes up with the solution of promising to block her. The next couple of days I found out he didn’t do that and was still talking to her. She showed me all the texts he said saying he wants to go further with the relationship and shit. I’m sad now knowing my friend who was like a brother to me betrayed me like this. The girl told me that she felt uncomfortable with him since they met only like 3 weeks ago.

I stopped talking to him and my other friend but feel a little messed up for dropping them. So AITA?

Flights and Airbnb had been booked and paid for with free cancellation for the Airbnb before the end of July. Unfortunately, last week one of the couples backed out of the trip. I let my other friend know I would still be down to go if we could find someone else to go so 1. I wouldn’t feel like a 3rd wheel and 2. We could lessen the extra costs we’d have to cover for the Airbnb.

With this being so last minute, we can’t find anyone to go but my friend really wants to go. Her boyfriend also had to jump through a lot of hoops to get the time off. I just wanted to cancel the trip to make it easier on all of us. They could take a trip and I could figure out something else. I would also return the money they paid for the Airbnb.

This is where it gets tricky. I ran into a mutual friend this past weekend who offered an invite to come along on their trip they’re taking in the same month. I wanted to bring up my other friend and her BF but the Airbnb only fits 4 (2 people already going), the dates are different (friend’s BF had to do a lot to get our group trip dates off), and it’s not my trip so not my place to be inviting people.

So, WIBTA for going on the other trip and cancelling the group trip (assuming I told my best friend about the other trip)?"	1	1	1.0

Jaccob is living with me while we go to college since his parents agreed to pay his half of the rent if we lived together. On top of paying for his rent and him working part time, Jaccob receives a weekly allowance from his mom to help him pay for groceries. I don’t have the same luxury as I am paying for everything on my own.   
  
We have an agreement living together that, unless we plan our meals together, we are responsible for our own food. Essentially he buys his own food and I buy my own, and we don’t really share unless asking first. This system worked well for us, especially given our different financial situations and different dietary preferences/appetite levels. Jaccob has a larger appetite than me so he usually gets more than I do when we go shopping.   
  
This has become a problem recently as Jaccob started running out of food and would start stealing mine instead. At first it was small things like bags of chips or fruit so I didn’t really comment on it, but then it started getting out of hand. I would go shopping for things like bread or cereal only for them to be completely gone two days later without me even getting any. I confronted Jaccob about this once before, and he simply shrugged it off and said he hadn’t had a chance to go to the store yet.   
  
This morning I finally had enough. I had gone shopping over the weekend and already my chips, oatmeal, cereal, and iced tea were either completely gone or nearly empty. I had barely even opened them and already I was almost out. Jaccob came into the kitchen while I was trying to make myself breakfast and immediately reached for my box of cereal, emptying the rest of it out. I groaned at this and asked him to please leave some of my food for me. When he asked what I meant I proceeded to list off everything of mine he stole and begged him to get his own food instead of always stealing mine because he eats it all before I get a chance and I couldn’t afford to keep feeding both of us. Jaccob seemed to get offended by this and asked if I was insulting his eating habits, which was obviously not the case. I tried explaining that I simply couldn’t afford to keep paying for food I didn’t even get to eat and reminded him that he had the funds to buy whatever he wanted. There was no reason I could think of for him to take mine instead of buying what he wanted.   
  
Jaccob got pretty snappy after I said that and once again accused me of judging his habits. He went off about how he was an adult and was allowed to do whatever he wanted in his own home and he didn’t need me policing him. He would do what he wanted with his money and he could eat whatever he wanted without me making him feel bad about it.

I live in a city that’s a 10 hour drive from her. As a result of the pandemic my parents wanted me to move closer to her so I would have some family around me. During my stay in the same city as my sister’s; she never made time to see me, would be on her worst behaviour when I was around. For the most part she never tried to be an active person in my life. Forgot my birthday and even when I had to move all of a sudden because of abusive roommates she never came to see me. She did not even make the effort to see me before my flight left. This all happened in 2021.

Fast forward in these 2 years, I have been the only one making effort to be in touch. She is very negative towards my ideas after school. I want to go to grad school & she constantly devalues my goals. I made a trip to go see her with my partner and she was so unappreciative, pretended to be sick and then went to work for the next two days. Made me cry in her room because I was getting frustrated with her negative comments on my clothes and appearance. She then promised she would make time to go to dinner with my partner. So I could introduce him to her. I then asked if she wanted to come downstairs to say hello to him. She refused. 

I showed her the promise ring my partner got me and instead of congratulating me or saying something nice. She said that the ring did not look like it was a solitaire as it was too small. I work part time as a sales consultant at a high end jewelry store. The solitaire is not small.

The day of the scheduled dinner she ignores all the texts I send her and never shows. Then texts me the next day that she was at work and didn’t have her phone on her. Her entire job requires her to have her phone on her person at all times. The week after I come back home, I try to reconnect with her and as I’m sharing troubles about my life. She says that I’m always crying and whining and that she’s tired of it. So for the first time. I tell her that this is why no one likes her. She says that is how she prefers it. She then proceeds to act really happy because I say that I will never call her again.

I have never seen someone so emotionally stunted. I have cut all contact with her and shared everything with my parents. My family wants me reconnect with her for her birthday this month. I’m not too sure."	1	1	1.0

My big brother we'll just call him ""Jay"" he got kicked out of our house when he was 18 for stealing money and pain medication that were prescribed for my mom after her car crash a few years ago (she's still trying to get that sorted out) 

Anyways we've told Jay he can stay in the backyard as long as he doesn't cause trouble. 
A few months ago he brought a female brindle grey pitbull. We told him that he can't have a pitbull in the back yard with him because he can barely get money for cigarettes and he wouldn't listen to us after we told him several times to get rid of her when she was a pup. 

Two days ago his dog attacked one of our dogs because she didn't have food for a few days and he didn't tell us. We have three dogs of our own all small breeds. A corgi mix and two Chihuahua mix one is a senior and that was is the one that got attacked. So we were in the living room watching TV and all of a sudden we heard screaming and yelling from our senior Chihuahua so we ran outside to find the pitbull attacking her. So we got them apart and brought our dogs inside.

We yelled at Jay and his girlfriend telling them 
They are dead to us if our Chihuahua dies just because he didn't want to get rid of the pitbull when they had a chance and we told them to pack their stuff and leave with their dogs because we're sick and tired of Jay being so careless about the dogs when we told him to get rid of her.

In that time she told me to pay the electricity because she was paying rent. She never paid rent and in the beginning of the year got a notice that she hadn’t paid rent for 8 months which lead to us being -6.5K in rent. I was shocked at that and moved out, i stopped all payments for the electricity that went through my account but gave my brother money in cash in case he wanted to stall the eviction. 

My brother (22) doesn’t work. Only recently he got an apprenticeship starting September and he got a new apartment leased for when he starts work. He’s been living with my mother in her boyfriend’s apartment in the meantime, while I went back to my grandma who i take care of. 

I recently got injured on my arm which requires surgery. I won’t be healed and able to get back to my part time job for another 3 months. This lead to me seeing my mother again after god knows how long since she had driven me to hospital once when I got injured (she demanded me pay for her petrol tho).

Now she called me earlier saying I have to give her my birth certificate for her work. I asked why and she sent me a form where it states that she can get benefits for having kids (even as adults since I’m in uni) in her household or kids she pays alimony for. I’m neither. 

Her accounts get frozen constantly due to her massive amount of debts she acquired over the years, but with kids in her household her account can’t be fully frozen. I refused and said if she wants it she needs to pay alimony. 

She called me an awful person and that I’m ruining my brother’s life because she has to pay his rent for the first couple months until he can pay it himself. I don’t see how this is my fault. I’m not responsible for her debt. 

She said I’m ungrateful and a disappointment and I’d pretty much lost it at that. I told her that I’ve been the one who takes care of her mother while she’s indulging in drugs and parties. That I’ve been working ever since I’m an adult while studying, meanwhile my brother wasn’t even going to school and just playing games. 

She said that she will take me out of the family insurance (i just got out of hospital btw) since I’m no longer her child. 

I am genuinely at a loss on what to do. AITA?"	97	36	0.95

We have a shared group of friends that do partner dance classes together. There’s this one person that we met a few months back, and I recently had a gut feeling that something was up. One evening, my bf and our friend went to a different dance class together and then came to another group dance event where I was coming too. I don’t have a lot of solid evidence to go of to draw these conclusions but I have such a strong feeling that something is not quite kosher about their friendship. Do you know that feeling when the “friend” is being overly nice to you and for some reason it feels like they’re trying to make up for fucking up something or deflecting some amount of guilt? And then my bf is being too overtly cold to her in front of me. But when I catch glances of them talking and dancing together it just looks like more than friendship level. To clear the air, my bf and I have many opposite sex friends, who are a mix of single/in relationships, and I’ve never felt insecure with any of them. It’s just this one person. And I can’t quite shake this feeling and it’s really eating me up. Anyway, I let my feelings get the better of me and I pulled my bf aside at the dance event (kind of pissed) to have a “private” conversation and asked him point blank if he has a crush on this person. He denied it, saying even that he doesn’t care about her, and if I wanted him to stop talking to her, he would. But I don’t want that. I don’t want to be the type of person who gets paranoid and jealous and controlling. But, this situation is just driving me crazy rn. AITA here?	1	1	1.0

I’m not going to lie, when me and my man got together I can say he was a little stuck on his ex girlfriend. I never caught them talking or anything but he would always bring her up or find a way to work her name into our conversations, I even found him subconsciously comparing us to each other. I told him how I felt uncomfortable with that and he changed. 

All of this was in the beginning months of our relationship and we’ve been good ever since. Maybe a week ago he got a few messages from his ex girlfriend saying her father died and she needed him to be there for her because he knew the dad too, and I guess they were close (he never talked about the dad to me, not even after he passed). I told him I didn’t have a problem with him supporting her and sending his condolences but going to the funeral with her and her family (IN ANOTHER STATE) is pushing it. 

He says i’m being insensitive because he should be able to go to the funeral and support her and her family but I think that’s weird, is it not? They haven’t been together for 5 years now so why is he the person you call to be a “support system” for you? i just don’t understand it. 

Maybe I am being a little insensitive but it just makes me uncomfortable, I don’t know. Why would you rather go to another state for a funeral of the girl who you had a horrible break up with father instead of staying home with your 3 month old baby and fiancée. I don’t get it."	1	1	1.0

Recently they began reaching out to me (38F) asking to assist with my 3 kids and offering to pick them up from school, they take the bus currently, and drive them to soccer, dance, and their various other activities. 
I have been saying no which is upsetting them, but the problem is I have 38 years of experience with them being extremely late or just forgetting to pick me up. I am an only child and have years of memories of sitting outside of buildings waiting wondering when or if they were gonna show.  If I could find a phone I would call an aunt or uncle and eventually someone would arrive. This happened my entire life I remember being 5 and sitting waiting, teachers or coaches calling them over and over.  I remember being 14 sitting at a friend's house until 2am calling them over and over and them not arriving, they were supposed to be there to get me at 7. And I walked to the friend's house as the building I was in was locked and it was the closest place to get to a phone to call them.
They were not bad parents and they loved me they were just really really unreliable.
I have allowed them to pick up my oldest kids before and more then once me or my husband had to leave work because  school got out 30 minutes ago and they were no where to be seen after they asked to pick them up from school.
They are stating now that they're retired they won't forget but I just don't believe them. I don't think working had anything to do with it, I just think they get distracted with other things. My kids have never had to wait or wonder where I am. My husband is aware of my issues with this and knows why and like me ensures he is always there waiting when they walk out of a building. If they are expecting us to be there we are there. Now my family is upset with me because I won't let them take the kids places. I have been honest with them why, but they claim I am living in the past and need to let it go.

During this night my GF was snoring the entire night. After having been waken up the first time and having lied awake an hour or two I nudge her to wake her up and ask her to sleep on her side. Which she then does. I can tell she falls asleep again pretty much right away as the snoring kicks back up. Later on during the night, I may have fallen into short bursts of sleep during this period, I can’t sleep from her snoring again and I nudge her again. 
Finally at 6 am or something I put in headphones and listen to music for the rest of the night until I fall asleep for maybe an hour or two more sleep.
This morning my GF complains that she didn’t sleep very well. And she insinuates that it’s because I woke a few times. Not long after now we are having a full blown argument and she says her grandma would never wake up her grandpa snoring and it just isn’t right to do this. I tell her it’s a very normal thing and my parents would often wake their partners snoring and my family would even wake me if I was snoring during a vacation trip. My GF is very upset, told me to find a gf who doesn’t snore and told me to find a girl who won’t snore then. I told her many times that there isn’t anything wrong with snoring and there’s no blame. She then tells me that she would never interrupt anyone’s sleep and that’s it’s very bad to do so. I told her she interrupted my sleep the entire night, and that it isn’t her fault she is snoring but at-least she could help me by sleeping in a way that is less prone to snore.
She now stormed out of our home and I don’t know where she went.

We have 1 dog and 1 cat that are unable to travel with us. We made arrangements with a friend to care for dog and cat 2 times daily. Our home is out in the country with no neighbors so dog knows his boundaries and doesn't stray. Cat goes out during the day and in at night. We pay this friend $100 a month to care for them. They live down the road and it is on his way to work so he doesn't really go out of his way. A couple of months ago friend got into unnecessary trouble and my husband loaned him $2500 for an attorney even after I said not a good idea due to the fact we had a lot of expenses coming up. And yes even more happened within 3 weeks. Husband landed in the hospital for a week ( while we are 17 hours from home) and was unable to work for 3 weeks. The loan agreement was to pay back $100 a week and we would deduct $100 a month for the care of dog and cat. Now.... we still have to pay our medical insurance weekly that us $550 a week. So I call friends wife ( we have been friends for years) to tell her to please have husband put money in hidden agreed place so our son in law can take it to our bank. I explained our situation and that it would be important for this to happen.  Her response to me was kind of a shock .  She literally sad to me "" well looks like you won't be able to do any shopping this month...lol"" I was really taken back by that.  Now in this time frame she has scheduled a Disney vacation ( we all know how expensive this is) her husband did not go on this trip due to his court date.  So she gets home and calls my husband and wants to use our very expensive lawn mower because "" her yard looks like a jungle ""  now let me say their yard is never kept, there is junk everywhere all the time .  Husband says ya sure...this really upsets me because if they brake it they can't fix it. Also we have an agreement with our son in law that he mows and maintains our yard while we are out of town so he also uses the mower and does all maintenance,  blades,  oil and filters.  They go to pick the mower up and call because our trailer isn't there....no son in law keeps it at his house in the barn due to our lack of space.  So they don't get the mower. ( I was relieved )
Next day wife text my husband,  "" are the keys in your mower""? Really? No and son in law has the mower today. Her response well can you have him drop it off to us when he is done?  Husband and I are now arguing over this. I say if you can afford a Disney vacation you can purchase your own mower.

Me (female) and my now ex girlfriend (lets call her m)  were best friends since first grade, after that she bullied me into  not having any friends for 5 years. I won't say much about it, but just know it was BAD. 

after a while of not having friends she asked of we could be friends again, I said sure and then the next thing I know I was in a group of 4 friendship.
Which was fun but two of the members (including M) were nice at first. I then one day asked M out 
She said no
Which I respected but then she said that she would be okay with doing promise rings 
So I said I'm down 

I was so inlove with her but she would fangirl about her at the time best friend tallman, and that hurt me but I thought that it was normal, after a while I started falling out of love while she was falling in it. 
I was falling out because she would tell Tallman about all of our disagreements which would make him get mad at me and yell at me through text 

Which was very upsetting 

One day 
She hurt tall man so bad. (I cannot say it on this subreddit) and stopped being friend eith him
And made him turn to me for help 
Which wasn't my fucking business and I didn't know how to help

So I yelled at her for putting her dirty work on me.
I helped him as best as I could and he turned out okay

Then I ended up leaving the friend group and being friendless for about half a year 

Then the other half i came back to the friend group to see that it has fallen apart. 

So I realised that I was the glue holding this thing together 

So remember m and the other person. Yeah they became my worst bullies, they would manipulate me and do all sorts of bad things (which I cannot disclose here)


Teleporting to now 

Me, tallmam and M's sister are best friends. Yhe things i couldnt disclose were so bad that tallman is now my bodyguard so i wouldnt get hurt. But we all realised how much of an asshole M is.she made us all hate eachother
I then yelled at her and let Tallman yell at her through me 

We were very upset at her 

She kept on saying :I've changed"" and shit like that even though she didn't 

Her apologies were empty.

So at some point I was so tired I passed out on my desk and when I woke up she had blocked me on everything.
I feel a bit guilty about starting an argument for no reason

So am I the asshole?"	1	1	1.0

She had her own share of traumas and struggles, which I can empathize with. However, instead of finding solace in each other's experiences, she became the center of attention, garnering the support and friendship of the entire class. Unfortunately, this also meant that I was excluded from games, group activities, physical education, and even events like Valentine's Day.
To make matters worse, the class would often make racist comments about my hair and skin color. Examples like comparing my hair to squid tentacles or calling me derogatory names like ""burnt bananas"" were common occurrences. These hurtful remarks further deepened the emotional wounds caused by the exclusion.
Recently, I stumbled upon an Instagram post where I discovered that my childhood bully had been awarded the title of ""County's Person of the Year."" Seeing this accolade triggered a mix of bitterness and anger within me. I felt that someone who had bullied me for so long should not be granted the validation of such a prestigious award. Consequently, I decided to confront her on Instagram, expressing the pain and suffering she, along with the rest of the class, had inflicted upon me.
In my message, I recounted the specific instances of bullying and explained the lasting impact it had on my life. However, her response to my confrontation infuriated me even more. She claimed she didn't do anything and couldn't remember me. This dismissal of my experiences intensified my anger and frustration. I possess diary entries documenting the incidents to prove their occurrence, and it's commonly known that individuals who have been bullied remember who targeted them. Despite this evidence, my friends dismiss my concerns, accusing me of being overly dramatic.
Given the situation, I find myself questioning whether I am the asshole for wanting to confront my childhood bully after seven years. Should I let bygones be bygones and move on, or is it crucial for her to understand the trauma she and the class put me through? My friends' dismissal of my experiences makes me doubt my decision, but the pain I still carry pushes me towards seeking acknowledgement and closure."	1	1	1.0

Along the way I have tired my best to include them in planning and my traditions. But his mother-in-law makes very subtle degrading comments as much as possible.

Fast forward to this weekend. The majority of wedding planning has been done by myself and wedding planner with my bridesmaids helping where they can. My fiancé has 2 brothers 28m and 23m. Both are in the bridal party but have done nothing to help or support in wedding planning. They repeatedly ask me questions but fail to reply to my texts to meet up so I can answer them and let them know their role in the wedding. It came to a head when my fiancé requested a video call with all the groomsmen for the wedding in 3 weeks. The younger brother continued to be rude and disrespectful towards my fiancé. I stayed quiet until he started to call my family names, and complained about having to attend the wedding and the pre-wedding events, at which point I broke and told him if he had a problem with the wedding he doesn’t need to come. His younger brother has always had some anxiety issues which we completely understand and attempt to support him in. So when we asked him to be in the bridal party we were very upfront about his role and our expectations. We even offered to find him another special role more in his comfort zone. But he continued to insist to be a part of the bridal party. I feel that sometimes he uses his mental health as a ticket to be rude and disrespectful. 

When we went to talk to his parents to express our frustration with his brothers attitude towards our wedding and me. His mother responded that his brother was very upset that he was yelled at. And that I need to not cause any drama so close to the wedding. 

I have asked my fiancé multiple times throughout the year to talk to his family and establish some boundaries. But he hates confrontation. I love my partner and do not want to make him chose between me and his family but this is starting to break down my mental health. 

So Reddit I am asking you am I a bridezilla? Are there major red flags? Should I call off my wedding?"	1	1	1.0

So, until now I didn't think that doing this was wrong, but alas...
I'm (31f) on the vacation with my dad (55-56?M) and my brothers girlfriend (22F). Every day till now we sorta had a routine where we have lunch together, then they go rest a bit in their room while I go to the pool and wait for them. There I use some towels to ""reserve"" two more recliners for them.
The hotel is not that busy, so there are more recliners available every time, but I still do it just to make sure no one else takes the ones next to me.
First few days, no problem, but day 5 I got approached by an older couple (germans I think?) who asked me why I need 3 recliners just for myself.
I explained it's for my dad and a friend, but they got aggitated saying I'm hoarding the best spots for someone who is not here. 
It almosts turned into an argument but luckily my dad and Laura (bros GF) showed up and the couple went away.
My dad thinks I did nothing wrong, but Laura is more compassionate and told me I should apologize to them, as I did in fact pick the best spots (I guess?).
So I wonder if I'm the asshole and should actualy  apologize. 
Thank you for your judgement! And sorry for any mistakes, I'm writing this on my phone and english is not my native languge."	1	1	1.0

All of this happens online entirely.  
  
Hi, I've had this looming thought cross my head for so long and I don't know if I have handled the situation correctly and I thought that coming to reddit on an anonymous throwaway account would help at least give me a second opinion on if I am an asshole or not; anyways, onto the story  
  
I have known two people that are pretty much the exact same age as I, one being an on and off ex-friend and a really close friend who's stayed that way the whole time this situation has gone down.  
  
The ex friend situation is honestly a whole can of worms to open, but the best way i can describe it is her having a super rocky past, where she has been exiled from discord servers due to her tendency to lash out at others for no reason, along with the lashing out at others she used to draw gore/hate art in an impulse decision due to BPD, I will not fully blame them for this, however to me it gets to a point where it's no longer eligible as an excuse for her poor behaviour.  
  
I have tried over and over again to help her better herself and move on from everything that she's done in the past, however I've always been turned down with an excuse to me which doesn't sound like an excuse at all, with her saying stuff along the lines of ""I wanna go back to the way things were"" and ""It wouldn't be the same"" which yes I can agree it won't be the same, but that's what moving on is about, it's about getting the change that you need in order to better yourself as a human being. This has gone on and off for so long up until January when she finally lost it. Saying it's been ""it's been 9 months"" and then pinning the blame onto me for me being a bad friend for being unable to help her after my constant attempts of trying to help her. I don't know how she doesn't see how I'm trying to help her, and it makes me feel awful thinking that I wasn't a good enough friend for her, which causes me to shut down mid conversation, with her expecting me to respond.  
  
Whenever I shut down, the only two things I can say, is either unintelligible mumbling, and ""I dunno"" it's a problem I've had for years, and I really wish I could fix it. I say this to her and then she still expects me to say something after I stated that I cannot speak coherently at the moment. This turns to her suddenly venting to me (another problem I've grown to gain a trigger of) about how she's not good enough for anybody and how nobody wants to help her. And as weird as this sounds, it reminds me of how my mother sounds whenever she disciplines me, intimidating me and then guilt tripping me into feeling either unsafe and/or shutting down. After I said this to her, she screamed at me, saying in all caps ""OH MY FUCKING GOD I GET IT NOW FUCK THIS SHIT I HATE MY LIFE""

AITA for getting involved?
 
Usually pretty good knowing if I’m the ass or not, but need help.  A close friend opens up to me after a night out having drinks. He tells me some stories; about 10 years ago when he and his wife were working at the same company, she went to a trade show. After, he received a group picture of people at the show where his wife was goofing around (poking or tickling) with this guy who had a reputation in the company of being a serial cheater. His wife had this guy’s sport coat draped over her shoulders.  He wasn’t sure who sent the picture and never confronted his wife. Fast forward a few years, she started her own retail store. When she opened the store, she had frequent deliveries from UPS and seemed to have got pretty friendly with the delivery guy. He didn’t think anything of it at the time, as it’s not uncommon to chat with delivery people you see nearly every day. What bothered him was she had put a dent in the front of her car. One day, she claimed that her “friendly” UPS guy kept mentioning the dent and that he offered to fix it, as I guess he did body work on the side.  So she ends up going to this guy’s house on a Saturday, to get this dent fixed. My buddy has no idea who this guy is or where his house is, he’s basically a total stranger. He confronted her and told her how uncomfortable he was that she did this, and she got pissed. Seems like there were a couple other similar “friends” situations leading up to today, so he was concerned she may be cheating on him and he doesn’t know what to do. I didn't want to take sides or get too involved in their lives, plus I’m only getting one side of the story (stories!). I was pretty blunt and I told him that “I am only hearing your version and knowing your wife, I don't want to suggest or say if she’s cheating or not, I don't know.” But I did say that based on the incidents he described,  at the very least she was incredibly disrespectful to him and their marriage, since she clearly had stepped over the boundaries of their relationship. Well, he went home and confronted his wife with his concerns and I guess it got pretty heated. He also shared my opinion, which she had a major issue with and ended up talking with another mutual friend's wife, saying I was a total AH and had no business saying she was disrespectful and I was trying to sabotage their marriage. She also told me to never talk to her again and that I need to find a new friend as she doesn’t want him “hanging around with an asshole who is trying to screw up their relationship.”   Was I the ass here to say what I thought to a good friend, who was in pain?  I thought I did the right thing by not stepping into the infidelity part (which I now think may actually be the case) and simply saying there needs to be mutual respect in a marriage.  So AITA??"	1	1	1.0

Hello, I 19F went over to my boyfriend 18M’s house this weekend and we went to visit his older brother who has a pool in their apartment complex. I have really bad eczema, so it’s hard to swim in chlorine and just in general, an unpleasant experience in which my boyfriend and their family know. So, unbeknownst to both my boyfriend and I, his family was going to go swimming outside. I asked my boyfriend to not swim and sit with me instead as I did not want to sit outside in the heat for hours alone watching everyone else have fun. He tried getting out of it, however was told no by his mother, so I asked him if maybe he could try getting out of the pool earlier instead. He did not, so I felt frustrated and got upset at him, telling him, I wish he had at least attempted to get out of the pool earlier and that I was alone sitting there for an hour outside. He had told me that he tried getting out, but was told no, and he’d just be told to get back in if he had left the pool earlier.

I choose not to renew because I feel the space causes us a lot of tension. We are trying find an apartment with a better layout and amenities. I am the one that ""inherits"" adult responsibilities; it's frustrating. I kept reminding them to get the paper applications they left in my car. One day I told them, when you keep putting responsibilities like this aside I feel like you are less invested than I am. Because they continued to leave the applications in my car for 3 weeks, I began applying to some apartment complexes only for me while also trying to find a better place for us. My partner does not communicate their feelings with me. I am always left guessing what their actions mean, if it is just honest executive dysfunction, aniexty, or something else. I figured if one of the places I applied to solo works out, I can pay to have the lease changed with their name added. This is the most difficult time I have ever had finding an apartment, I have never had to apply to more than 2 places before. The total amount of apartment complexes  and private landlords I have spoken/emailed/applied this time is definitely over 30. We got new applications for the same place since the ones in my car were yellowed from the Sun. I filled out mine and as much information I knew about my partner and said, please fill yours out. They did not. I spent one morning filling out their side and woke them up so they could write the SSN and signature on the forms. There is nothing bad on our records, the market is just rough. I asked my partner to please contact 2 other complexes; they didn't. I ended up doing it. I am a supervisor at my job and I have to handle a lot of people with kids gloves frequently. One of the last things I want do when I'm not wearing my supervisor attire is handle someone with kids gloves. I admitted to my partener that when they weren't taking action on the paper applications in my car, I started applying to places by myself because of their lack of action. They looked deeply hurt, but I'm also deeply hurt that someone I have spent the last six years with would want to mess with my livelihood. Their family doesn't live far away, so they can always stay with them  but there is not enough room for me. They also tell me that everything is, ""whatever I want."" When I ask a serious grown-up question like, ""How much money would you like to spend on rent monthly."" The answer is, ""It's whatever you (me) want."" I want to care because my partner was talking about getting a new car and if that is a goal they want to work towards then I want to be able to include saving in our lifestyle. If I ask them where they would like to live their answer is, ""It's whatever you (me) want."" I want to be inclusive, but I get shut down. I guess I'm to the point where I just need to look out for myself, but the thought  hurts."	1	1	1.0

Whenever he gets riled up, and he does so easily, it’s very hard for him to calm down and ends up verbally lashing out at us whilst showing threatening body language. And whenever we try to point out what he’s doing, he dismisses us and tries to justify his behavior, pointing out what we’re doing wrong instead and trying to control the situation by making it about him and continuing to escalate, having the GALL to talk back at us when we point it out and him continuing to make excuses. It’s the literal definition of narcissism and gaslighting despite us being called that, and he’s never able to just shut up, admit fault, calm down, and leave it at that. He’s like Trvmp in that regard, and oh BOY do I hate that man.

And I do not care if he is autistic, no he is HIGH FUNCTIONING and KNOWS better yet refuses to do so because he’s just a dickhead! Miss me with that “ableism” BS, he ain’t protected under ADA! If he doesn’t get his act together now, he’s never going to succeed despite having an engineering degree under his belt! I honestly worry for him and the reason why we do what we do is because we LOVE him.

Okay here’s what happened: We were shopping in Canada earlier after a weekend trip and needed to hurry before the border crossing line got too long. Brother found Kinder Surprise eggs but they are illegal in the US and asked an employee if they had Kinder Joy (Joy eggs are split into two hemispheres with one having the chocolate and the other the toy). She didn’t know what he was talking about and had to flag over another employee. I asked him if he was gonna buy some but he simply said he was just asking. I then chastized him for wasting the employees’ time and he walked away before coming back to criticize me for my “tone of voice” while he was visibly agitated and had his voice raised. Cue the above situation as we left the door, which thankfully ended before customs.

And now that I’m at my home, I’ve tried texting him about what he needs to work on but was met with a response to “stop telling him what to do” which only proves my point. However my mother took his side when calling me asking if I got home safe, and now I really don’t know what is and isn’t. Now I feel as if I’ve been gaslit by proxy!"	1	1	1.0

This evening, I came to Sam (and I)'s room wanting to talk about something serious.  Essentially, I've been feeling really down for the last month and wanted to open up to him a bit about it.  I was feeling a bit nervous about the conversation.  I go into the room and asked him if I could bother him.  He said yes, and so I sat on the bed, paused for a bit, and then started talking/crying.  About 2-3 sentences in, he says ""let me go get some tissues.""

Sam left the room, and instead of just getting the tissues like he said, went to the washroom to pee.  Then he came out and went into the kitchen where he took out his frozen dinner and made some noise in the kitchen for maybe 30 seconds or so (not sure what he was doing).  

At that point, I started feeling really hurt, because I feel like I was being abandoned right when I was crying.  I came out of the bedroom and he was coming back towards the bedroom.  I asked ""what are you doing?""  And he said, ""I had to go pee and take out my dinner  Let's go back to the bedroom.""  I lost it with that remark.

I leave the room.  Sam followed me and tried to get me to talk about the issue I came to him about, but I shut down and refused to talk about it anymore.  I couldn't get over his reaction.  We argued about him leaving the room, and Sam says that he knew it was going to be a long conversation and he didn't think it was an emergency, so that's why he wanted to use the washroom and take out his dinner first to eat at a reasonable time.  I couldn't understand why he wouldn't just express that more clearly, and it also made me feel like he was thinking about dinner while I was crying to him. 

Since I'm already in a bad mood, I can't tell if it's reasonable that I'm hurt by this, and now I don't feel comfortable opening up to him about the original conversation.  He's now mad at me that I can't let this go.

I do not drink alcohol very often (maybe once every few months) which is known to my friends since every time they go out to the bar, I decline. I instead suggested we go to a different salon that charges $32 for a regular pedicure. I’m pretty frugal with my money and rarely do I spend money on something like this, and I really don’t want to spend the extra money on a service I won’t use. 

My friend got upset and said she really wanted the mimosas, so I offered to host her and our other girl friends who would be going at my house where they can drink mimosas for cheaper, and then I can drive everyone to the salon. I also don’t think it’s a good idea for everyone to have unlimited mimosas in a one hour time slot right before driving, so this also just seemed like a smarter idea to me.

She ended up saying that I’m being very difficult and making a mountain out of a mole hill, and I should just pay the extra $20 since it’s a celebration, this is the salon everyone else wants to go to, and I’m the only one holding up the plans.

I (19 F) have been with my bf (18 M) since almost 3 years. At the beginning, he was sweet and all was going great. We were loving each other, speaking when something was bothering us, etc. But, some weeks/months after that, his mom started talking shit about me to my bf (let's call him Daniel), criticizing things like my clothing style (following her it was too revealing) or any other aspect of me, but I don't remember well. To sum up she was pushing him to leave me. 
Here I have to tell you that his mom has bipolar. 
Daniel started feeling torn between his mom and me, and started sort of trusting her in a certain way ? I knew it was his mom's fault so I fought for us, even if I was kinda the only one.
I started feeling sad, anxious. I have a tendency to depression and I was fragile at this moment, so I relapsed. I tried to 🦴 myself in september 2021. My bf came to see me after school because he was really worried, but his mom called him and shouted at him that he had to come back home immediately and that he couldn't stay with me. He was crying while listening to her but chose to go back to his place. Later in the night, he send me that I had to get better by myself and that he couldn't stay with me if I didn't. At this moment I KNEW it was her mom's words he was saying. He came back to apologize later.
The months after that were like yo-yo : I wasn't healing, he wanted to leave me each time with his mom's words, then I reassured him and he stayed.
After like almost a year, his mom understood that she was a bitch and stopped saying bad things about me... For some months. Then she started again. And stopped. And started again... Sometimes she said very rude things to me, told me to leave his house at 10 pm because she didn't like the way i talked at the meal (I travel by bus). She prevented us seeing each other.  She even criticized my mom and our house when we invited her to dinner.

I forgave each time. I accepted to go back to her housse because she was acting so sorry and my bf wanted me to. But now each time I go to her house I am sick in my stomach, I know that she can scream at me whenever she wants to, or telling me some harmful things that will make me have another anxiety attack. I know that I walk on eggshells and I hate having to go to her house. Each time she acts nice, I feel like it's fake. I am still struggling with depression and anxiety to this day but my bf supports me now. 

Am I the asshole for not wanting to see her ? Or for don't liking her ? Should I forgive all those things even if there will always be another time ? Should I understand her because I am mentally ill and she is too ?"	1	1	1.0

I enjoy my job and want to make it a career despite everything that teachers deal with. I love tutoring my students when they need help with something and am a very approachable teacher. That being said I also have my limits for what I'll do and won't do.

One of my  friends, F35 came to me the other day and asked me if I could help tutor her child in  the subject Im credentialed in as well as one that I am proficient in. I told them that I'd get back with them on whether or not I could. The thing is I know the child is a problem child and I knew immediately there would be problems with tutoring them. And before anyone says anything I'm sure that they don't have a learning disability. So after a day I came back to them and told them straight up that I wasn't going to be tutoring their child because it would be too difficult and I wasn't going to do that to myself when I already have to teach students during work who are difficult. The friend got mad at me and told me that their child just needs to have a good tutor and that I wasn't being a good friend and an asshole for not doing it. So AITA?"	1	1	1.0

I (18F) still live with my parents and my mom loves to talk to / about my brother(25M). She would talk to him on the phone as we live in different countries. And, whenever she would call him, she would ask me to talk to him, I would refuse. I have many reasons for this.
Firstly, he SA’d me (mostly) and my older sisters (23F and 24F) for about 5 years while my parents did nothing. They knew it was happening and “tried” to stop it though im pretty sure they cared more about him stealing food than us being SAd. 
Secondly, he continuously stole from my family and others. In one instance he stole my debit card to purchase christmas presents for our family.
He also tended to befriend and even date my friends. Mind you, this was when I was in middle school and he was 18-19.
The reason I pose this question is because it was his birthday recently and my parents asked if I’d said happy birthday to him and when I said no, they acted like I was a monster. I simply replied that I didn’t care because he’d skipped my birthday before. Im pretty sure I know the answer but AITA?"	1	1	0.99

Due to some problems, I'm not yet fully registered. Back when I was in middle school, I was heavily bullied and was pulled out after receiving death threats through text messages. Due to this, I spent my 8th grade year doing online school. Fast forward to now, I was relatively excited to be going back to school. Until a couple days ago, I received another text message, basically threatening me again. I sent my mom and screen shot, and she was obviously worried and comforted me. Today, I sent her a link to an online school, assuming I would do it again, but she yelled at me for it. Apparently I'm overreacting for not feeling comfortable with going back to public school. I'm worried that the bullying from 7th grade will only get worse now, considering I don't have any friends to help stand up for me. Before anyone asks, yes I told the school about the death threats and bullying, but they did nothing about it. They basically told me there was nothing they could do, and let it happen. I spoke to my sister about it, and she agrees with my mom that I'm being selfish because I already agreed to go back to public school this year. I'm just scared I'll get bullied worse than last time, and end up physically hurt. The school I'm supposed to attend has a large history of fights breaking out. So, AITA?	1	1	1.0

That's not how it went down stop lying (my name) your gonna piss me off"" and I reply saying ""why would I lie"" 

the topic hops to her getting upset and yelling at people aka me she claims I never leave her alone when she's angry when I will literally be in my room and she will come in just to yell at me and I said ""sometimes you just be mad though it don't even be because of us sometimes"" and then she keeps going on and on saying it our fault why she's angry all the time (if we make you so angry why have kids or why not tell us tf and how you bring up a topic then get mad when I tell the truth 😭)

 but this morning around 6-7am she comes in the room saying ""you really hurt my feelings yesterday"" I ask her how and say I'm sorry and she proceeded to say I painted her out as the bad guy and the story I told wasnt how it went down at all (I remember how it went down cause she had me lie to my teacher and say I hit my head on the wall cause i had a bruise) she said I said she was just mad all the time and would just yell at us just cause and I said I never said all the time i said sometimes she cusses me out and proceeded to say ""like you won't even tell your dad how you actually feel about him coming back"" I say sorry even though I wasn't sorry because what she said was out of pocket and she kept trying to manipulate me and guilt trip me into saying things I didn't say and making me feel bad that I'm too scared of my father to tell him how I feel about him coming back. it wasn't my intention to make her out as the ""bad guy"" but it's also not my fault she took it that way because she's the one who brought up the conversation.

We met in high school and got engaged earlier this year. J has worked at the same job for almost three years now. I don't work because I'm a full time student, this has been discussed between J and I and we both agree that so long as I'm in school I don't need a job (though I've offered to get one if needed) and that when I graduate he will take time off from his job to go to trade school while I work. 

J has been complaining about his work a lot recently, a bunch of different things really. He complains about a manager he doesn't like and about how he isn't being promoted despite having stayed with the company for three years. (Please note this specific company has a rule that says only people 21 and up can be managers, and J has been told by multiple managers that his age is the reason he isn't being promoted.) It's all fine mostly, I'll listen to him complain and be supportive.

His job is a fairly common one at a large arcade chain, so there are a lot of student employees. When summer ended a lot of the students had to change their hours to work around their classes, so everyone's hours got rearranged. The managers asked J if he could work a double on sundays since that was a day they were struggling to find people to work on. He agreed and now he works 12-12 on sundays but has tuesday-thursday off. 

Now, credit where credit is due, J is an extremely hard worker. He goes above and beyond in his job and does more than his position requires. That being said, he will not stop complaining about how hard he works and how sore he is. It's all he talks about when he is home. It's gotten to the point where he's distracting my from studying because he won't stop complaining.

 I eventually snapped at him and told him if he didn't like it then he should ask for his original hours back. He didn't want to do that and leave them short staffed so I told him to stop doing so much at his job, and only do what he was hired to do. He didn't want to do that because 'then he'd be bored' so I told him to basically stfu and stop complaining if he wasn't going to do anything about it. 

Now he's gotten pissy and says ITA. Is he right?"	1	1	1.0

Backstory: Joe and I were together for 5 years and we have since a year parted ways. It wasn't a perfect breakup, but we both managed to maintain some level of cordiality. We've both moved on (Joe is currently in a new relationship with a girl let's call her Maria) and I'm happy for him.   
Now, on to the issue at hand. Joe recently texted me and asked me to remove all the photos of us as a couple from my Instagram account. These pictures are typical couple photos - us looking in love, kissing but also standing normally next to each other - basically the standard pictures you'd expect from a happy couple. He expressed that he was uncomfortable with the photos being public as he doesn't want people to think we're still together and he feels ashamed seeing himself portrayed as still loving me publicly.   
From my perspective, I see these photos as memories of a part of my life that I cherished. I explained to him that I don't want to erase our past, that I loved him at the time those pictures were taken, and that I don't intend to pretend as though it didn't happen. I still talk about him and our time together with people around me because I am not ashamed of what I lived with him, although I wouldn't want to get back together. It's a part of my past and I don't want to hide it, rather show that I'm over it and embrace it as happy past.   
He further explained that he feels ashamed when he sees these pictures as it reminds him of the time when he was hurt and feels like a fool for not seeing the breakup coming (I was the one breaking up). He also mentioned that it's out of respect for his new relationship with Maria that he wants these photos removed.   
Our conversation took a turn when I refused to delete the photos. He felt I wasn't respecting his feelings and declared that he was going to report every picture if I didn't remove them within 48 hours. He also mentioned that he felt he had a right of removal due to privacy laws in Europe (GDPR). This felt like a huge overreaction to me, and I told him that I couldn't understand his points and that he wasn't taking my feelings into account either.   
So, Reddit, AITA for refusing to delete photos of my ex and me from my Instagram account?"	1	1	1.0

I (29F) own my home. I am quite comfortable with my bills and don’t need supplementary income from renting. I also really like my privacy. 

A friend (26F) needed a place to stay for the summer between school years. When she asked if she could stay with me, I said yes and we agreed that it would only be for the summer, that the rent would be $500 (rooms rent for $900-1000 here), and that they’d help out around the house. 

Since May she has not left my house. Has not worked. Doesn’t buy groceries. Doesn’t have any ambition. She just plays games and talks to friends online all day. I know she had anxiety but so do I and I can hold down the fort. 

I do 95% of the cleaning, cooking for us both, and work around the house. If I directly ask her to do something, she will, but I find that tiresome. 

She paid rent once in June. Admittedly I also haven’t addressed this. 

I can technically afford to support two people, but I don’t want to and shouldn’t have to as far as I’m concerned. This was supposed to be doing a favor by having her here but I’m going bananas. 

I am worried she won’t leave in September as when I’ve addressed it, she avoids the topic and say she’s still figuring it out. 

My family is planning to stay here in September and I really am just excited to have my house back and be self sufficient again. 

She has, within 1/2 a mile, ample fast food opportunities and a few manufacturing facilities with “WE ARE HIRING ON THE SPOT” signs out front. But has never left to hand in a resume. 

I don’t know if I can bring myself to kick her out with no savings and nowhere to go but I feel like I am being taken advantage of. 

My plan is if she isn’t out by the end of the long weekend, I am going to change the internet password until rent is paid for that month and work out a payment plan for the backlog as well as a concrete timeline to get my space back with a finite end date. 

Would this make me an asshole?"	1	1	1.0

- We refers to myself (24M), my older sis (25F), and my younger sis (20F).

- My family is Bangladeshi. My parents are Muslim and religious but not overtly. However, my siblings and I are not religious but our parents don't know that.

- The entire family (43F mom, 58M dad, myself, older sis, younger sis, and 13 year old sister) previously went to Saudi Arabia for Umrah back in April 2016. My siblings and I did not enjoy that trip.

My parents want to go back there. They want to travel there during the week of Christmas and come back on New Year's.

I asked my parents their reasoning in going and my mom explained that this is Allah's (the God in Islam) home and we must see it as much as we can because we get blessed more. She also went on an anecdote about how a family friend went there with foot problems and it was cured by the time her daughter got married. My mom has random seizure attacks at infrequent intervals along w/ other illneses and believes that going back for Umrah may cure them all.

My mom just needs one of us to go, and she does not care who. My dad is going but she also wants 1 more person just in case something goes awry.

Problem is my siblings and I don't want to go. None of us are religious and none of us want to spend time in a country we don't like.

My parents are upset because they think we are not taking care of them by going there / not respecting their wishes and have provided for us for a long time. My mom asked ""what if I have a seizure attack in Saudi Arabia?"" I told her ""that'll be a problem as we are not familiar with their hospital system and billing."" They still provide for my sisters. They see our resistance as disrespectful and it is un-Islamic to take care of parents.

The problem is as we get closer to the holidays, I'm expecting a boiling point where the whole family will be soured over this.

Here's why I think I may be an AH:

- I can afford to take the time off from work and, depending on the amount they state, contribute for this trip but I don't want to out of my own selfish desire and lack of incentive to do so.

- I went on a tirade about the anecdote my mom stated and said it felt like hearsay w/o actually directly saying so. I also did go on a tirade about our last visit to Makkah and Madinah, including the bombing in Madinah (bombed 1.5 months after we left).

- The main conflicts are what do I prioritize more - making my parents happy or sticking to my beliefs and is this belief (not liking Saudi Arabia - Makkah and Madinah in particular) a hill worth dying, which honestly I'm not entirely sure. The other issue is if I do say I will go, my older sis will be PISSED because she will see this as me not sticking to my guns and not asserting myself. If I do change my mind, then it's more about preventing the boiling point from arriving."	1	1	1.0

We are long distance, with her being 8 hours away by train, and a 7 by car. Despite being so far away, we've been doing really well. She has it hard sometimes and cries because she misses me, but there's only so much we can do since we both have our own jobs where we are. Because of this distance, we're usually stuck texting. 

Two nights ago, we were talking, and she was reminiscing to me about how we used to talk when we were just starting to flirt. She had this habit of keyboard smashing every time she got nervous or embarrassed and to be honest, it was kind of annoying sometimes. All I was trying to do was flirt or compliment her, but she wouldn't give me much back aside from a paragraph of gibberish and a small thank you at the end. I told her this and her tone changed. She didn't seem mad or anything. She just stopped using emojis, didn't seem as energetic or happy, and is just somewhat distant. 

I feel like I messed up by admitting this, but I only meant that one characteristic, not her. It feels a little too late to bring it up now, but should I talk to her about this or wait for her to say something?"	1	1	1.0

My father (m45) was also invited in the wedding but he couldn't attend it as he was having an important business trip.

It was a huge wedding and there was a separate reception party held two days after the vows were exchanged. So from here onwards I am gonna call my own maternal uncle as the groom and my new maternal aunt as the bride.

At the wedding day I met a lot of relatives. I met the bride's father (m52) (this is important keep this in mind) along with some other unrecognised faces. During the whole wedding day the bride's father kept his eye on me and was constantly trying to get close with me. He tried to approach me in every way and said he can show me around the place. Though I politely declined him, it was suspicious but my dumbass thought he was showing me mere courtesy.

After the hectic wedding I informed these all incidents about the bride's father to my mother and grandmother. But they just laughed and said that probably he was just tryna be nice to me.

At the reception day I got creepy stares from the bride's father again the whole time. Then it was the family photo session time and we all went to the open space for it. Bride's father insisted all of us to take a group photo and that's when I lost my shit. The bride's father was behind me and slowly his hands crept up from my arm to the back of my shoulder. He started rubbing his filthy hands on my back and tried to grab my waist. It didn't take me much time to understand that the touch was absolutely in a gross and disgusting way. In defense I intentionally stepped on his foot hard with my heels. His hand moved and he yelped. 

I didn't make a scene there but I immediately stormed out almost ran from that party. My mother and grandmother followed me as to ask what happened. After I explained what actually happened they said that I probably misunderstood the touch and it would be problematic if I left. They also said that if I leave I would seem like an asshole to all the guests and this will pique their curiosity.

Nonetheless I left the venue without hearing them out. I walked back to my grandparents house which was just a 15mins walk from the venue. I spent the rest of the evening inside the house. I didn't cry but what hurted me the most was that my own family didn't think about me. All they thought was how the guests would react if I left the party.

Later on my mother and grandmother told me not to say this incident to my father cause then he would never let me come to my maternal grandparents house ever again. And again told me I should not have behaved like that in front of so many guests. I could've handled it differently.

So AITA for storming out from my own maternal uncle's wedding ??"	1	1	1.0

After some more arguing he stormed out and had a cigarette and a beer in the garden. I cried into my stepmum and sisters arms, and he continued to say I’m a lying gaslighter. Once everyone sat down, I ran out the front door. I hid in a bush next to the lake by his house. He drove up and down the road a few times, crying to my mum down the phone. Once I thought he had given up and gone to his house again, I made a run for it. She got in the car and got there as fast as she could (they live about 10 minutes apart). Of course, he hadn’t given up. He drove down the road super fast and kept telling me to get in. I kept refusing. It ended with me telling him to f**k off.

Lori and I have been best friends since elementary school. She even lived with me for six months in high school, because she was having issues at home. This is when we became extremely close.

We still talk frequently. Some months we talk A LOT (like every day) and other months it's only here and there, because we both just get busy with life. But Lori has always called me her best friend, and I've always called her my best friend. She's told me numerous times that I 'understand her better than anyone else in her life.' (One of the reasons for this is because Lori and I have both experienced some traumatic things and have both struggled with mental illness). She's also called me a 'platonic soulmate' multiple times.

The reason I'm saying all this is because I'm very confused and hurt, with the situation I'm about to explain to you. And I want an outside opinion of whether or not this friendship was just all in my head...?

So like I said, Lori's getting married. I'm cool with her fiance, he's (24M) cool with me. We've all hung out together many times and gotten along great.

For context, I'm a digital artist/painter full time, and because of this Lori specifically requested that I design her wedding invitations, the name cards for the tables, and the thank you cards they'll be sending to the guests after the ceremony is over. I did all of this for free (because she's my best friend and I also kind of saw it as one of my gifts to her). Once I finished designing everything and sent all of it to her, she thanked me and said she'd be 'sending me an invitation soon.'

The RSVP date was August 20. I obviously know this because I designed the invitation lol. Thing is, she never sent me an official invitation? Even though she's texted me ^ that I am invited. So that's already strange.

Secondly, I saw a few days ago that she had her bachelorette party... her and all of her other friends (some from high school with us) were all posting about it on their social medias. I was completely taken aback. She hadn't mentioned it to me. She didn't even invite me? I also realized then that she didn't ask me to be a bridesmaid. (Which I was expecting, we've talked about our dream weddings in the past and have said before that we'd be each others bridesmaids?)

Now I'm debating on not going to the wedding at all. (Not to mention I’m not even sure if I'm actually invited?) I don't know what I did wrong. She still texts me like everything's normal? So I just don't understand. This was my best friend, or at least I thought. And I really don't want to be upset with her for this, as it is 'her day' and all. But it's made me question everything. It just feels like a slap in the face, and it really feels like I'm being excluded from this huge moment in her life.

So, WIBTA if I don't go to the wedding and just let this friendship go? Because it seems like it means a lot more to me than it does to her."	1	1	1.0

We've been together for a while, and things were going well until she decided to ""jokingly"" propose to me Friday night. Now, I've always been clear that I'm not a fan of the idea of marriage. There was even a post I made about it MONTHS ago that kind of made the rounds. She doesn't know about that post but I only mention it to show you all that I've felt this way for a while and never made it a secret. She knows I don't want to get married anytime soon, or maybe ever. Just not my thing.   
  
However, she still went ahead and proposed in a public setting, putting me on the spot. I took her out to dinner last Friday night and everything was cool until about 20 minutes in, she starts talking about marriage and joking around about my stance on it. I asked her politely to respect my values, but she just took it farther. She got down on one knee and pretended to present a ring to me in front of everyone (Nobody noticed it except for an older gentleman who gave me a side-eye and said nothing. He didn't seem to approve of her little stunt either). I felt humiliated and emasculated.   
  
I had to fake an emergency to get us the F out of that place without causing a big scene. We swiftly left the restaurant (after paying obviously) and I drove her home and told her how that little stunt was not cool and shouldn't happen again. She apologized and was in tears by the time I dropped her off. I didn't even go that hard on her but she's emotional, the type to cry watching Nemo.   
  
It sucks because our night was going well up until that point and I just feel like she intentionally disrespected me for no reason. We're not on speaking terms at the moment because I want to teach her a lesson in respect so that she won't try to pull something like this in the future, as a ""joke"" or otherwise. If she had pulled this with no-one around, that would be one thing (still not cool at all, but not as bad) - but the fact she did this in front of others just brings it to a whole nother level.

She was feeling very nervous about starting a new  school in a completely different house, town and school. The reason she’s moving to the school here is because she gets bullied really bad in the school at her mums house and the school doesn’t accept the course she wants to do. So she wanted a fresh start. 

About a week before she was moving down here she went to a nail salon to get her nails done and they were talking to each other. She told the person doing her nails that she was going to live with her dads. The person doing her nails told her that “she was wrong for leaving her mother and that she isn’t going to have a good life living with just her dad and her brother, and that she needs a women in her life. My daughter was already feeling bad about not having a lady in the house since it’s just me and her brother living here. So I felt that she was just rubbing it in my daughters face.


When my daughter told me that the person said that I wrote a bad review on the place and said that it wasn’t acceptable to say things like that to people. (And most of the reveiw on the nail salon were really bad and low anyways… lol)

My ex wife said I was just being dramatic and that it wasn’t a big deal.

To give you a slight history we have known each other since childhood. We were really good friends until late teens and then we got distant. We still talked a bit but she moved away and had other more important people in her life. 

Now in the last 5 years she has been fighting a divorce and somehow through that she changed and spent a lot of time asking for money and drives and favors.  Every time she reached out it was for something.  And when I reached out or said no I would be ignored until something else dand up. 

Around Christmas we had a huge fight and stopped talking for a few months. She apologized and said she has been healing so we went for dinner and she seemed better. The next week we went to a doctors appointment and zgs was basically told she had cancer but for it to be official the biopsy results needed to come in. 

The results came in but the local doctor would be on vacation till the end of the week and she wanted to know right away so she made an appointment in a city 1.5 hours away if there is no traffic but there is always traffic so the round trip would likely be ,4-5 hours.   She didn't tell me she made the appointment and then the evening before asked me to drive her..

Now I have things in my life going on and I was going to be out of town for two weeks so I was going to spend the day packing and cleaning then going to work.  I told her the gas would be alot and with recent expenses I couldn't afford the tank of gas but also that I'm not sure I would be able to find the time on such short notice but I'll try to spend to things. 

Later that night I officially told her it just wasn't going to work and it was too short notice.  She told me that. She cannot believe she is not even worth 3 hours of my time and goodbye.

Alright, here's the deal.

I'm all about empowerment, enlightenment, and making meaningful connections. As a financial domme, content writer, and influencer, I know what I want and I go after it. So, when I realized my recent relationship was lacking in the mental stimulation department, I didn't hesitate to pull the plug.

Let me break it down. My partner was supportive of my hustle, and that's great. But when it came to the real talk, the deep conversations that get your brain firing, they just weren't on the same wavelength. As a sapiosexual, I thrive on that mental connection. I need someone who can match my intellect and keep me engaged.

So, I made a call – I ended things. Now, I'm getting hit with questions. Did I overreact? Was I too harsh? Maybe. But here's the thing, I'm not about to compromise on what I need. I've got a brand to build, a blog to run, and a life to live. Ain't nobody got time for bland conversations.

So, I'm dropping this bomb here: AITA for saying ""thanks, but no thanks"" to a relationship that didn't fire up my brain cells, even though my ex was a decent person and had my back in other ways?

I've been rather self conscious about this until the past few months, when I started trying to be more positive of my body and acknowledging that my body as a woman is simply not the same as a teenager. I started wearing tighter clothes I used to love/cropped tops again, which brings me to this issue. I went out to dinner with my friend wearing [this](https://imgur.com/a/AcMIDMB), and on our way leaving she very directly told me that she was embarrassed to be around me and that I have to dress more appropriately for my body (this was not an especially fancy place).

For context, my gf is 5ft tall and we met 2 years ago. She is not the most attractive; she has very large boobs, for context I prefer smaller chested women, which drew me to her when we first met. However, over time, her breasts have grown massively. I have mentioned on multiple occasions there are diet and fitness changes she can make to fix this.

Her birthday was earlier this week, and as she is an animal lover, I decided to take her to a drive through safari tour. It was me, her, my two older brothers, and her best friend (lets call her Karen). 

Karen has been a little bit troublesome when it comes to me and my gf's relationship, often inserting her opinions.

As a lighthearted prank, during the section of the safari when we drove throught the chimp enclosure, myself and my brothers had prearranged to open the car door and throw Karen out into the enclosure before shutting and locking the door.

We had assumed Karen would see the funny side of this, however, my gf and Karen were horrified when the chimps immediately barreled towards her, ripping off her clothes and out her hair. For context, Karen is 5ft 2, slim build, and very flat chested. 

We quickly unlocked the doors and let Karen back in, but not without having a good laugh at her expense (basic stuff like calling her ugly and a bald bitch).

I asked my brothers and they said I did nothing wrong, but my gf won't speak to me and says ""ruined"" her bday.

Anyway, i opened up to her about how my aunt would talk about her and her ""drinking problem"". I don't see this as a problem most of the time. At first, i thought my aunt had reason to talk bad about her, since i used to open up to her about how i struggled to have a relationship with my mom. I stopped hanging around my aunt when she got mad at me for asking for a dollar, telling me to get a job whilst shes looking at coats she cant afford. This was when i was 14, and i still live in a very small town with no one to drive me anywhere. There are 2 businesses that aren't family owned, and they are never hiring anyway.

 Recently i went out with my mom, just to talk and try to strengthen a relationship. She told me how she noticed i haven't been around my aunt recently, and opened up to me about how my aunt resented her long before our rough patch. Even before they really got to know each other. I told my mom about how my aunt talks about her drinking and she thanked me for telling her.

Later, my mom told my dad about what i said and how she just is done being around my aunt. My dad said he understood, and that was that, until the next day when she came over and my mom got really pissed. I tried to calm her down and we had a fun day after that, although she refused to talk to my dad. My mom then came to me and asked if my dad could confront my aunt about what she was saying, and at the time i said yes but then i though about how it would loop back to me. I love my aunt, and i know things could never be the same after.

I know she needs to grow up a little, since shit talking is for highschool students, but i loved hanging out with her when she wasn't talking bad about my mom. I told my mom about my dilemma and she guilted me by saying how this is the only way to mend things with her and my dad. Shes upset i don't want him to tell her what i said she said, even though she did. AITA?"	1	1	1.0

My birthday is this Friday (September 8th) and every year my family has had a birthday dinner for me, along with birthday dinners on my siblings’ birthdays. However this year my girlfriend had some stuff planned for us.

I told my mother this back in the beginning of august, and she said she’d talk to my girlfriend about it. This wasn’t a huge issue since I thought they’d compromise on a date and time, and I told the both of them I’d prefer a lunch over a dinner.

My girlfriend told me they had come to a compromise, but then a few minutes later my mother texted me “Hey - so if you don't want to come for birthday dinner - it's fine - it's up to you I guess” 

I texted her back “You and (girlfriend) agreed we are gonna do lunch on that Sunday of my birthday. I understand dinner has been a tradition in the family but I personally have always preferred lunch, and I would like to start doing that rather than a dinner.”

All hell broke loose after this, as she said that she only agreed to lunch since it was “the only way she would see me.” This wasn’t true however since I had plans to go to their house sometime in the coming weeks. My mother decided to bring my father into it, and both told me that I was selfish and inconsiderate for wanting to do lunch over dinner, and said that dinner has always been a tradition in the family. At one point my mother said “At least we’re not like (girlfriend’s) family”, which upset my girlfriend and I greatly. I ended the conversation and didn’t talk to my parents for a few days, before my dad came to me asking about dinner once more, to which I replied that we would come over for lunch.

That Saturday after the conversation, I decided that I was uncomfortable with the argument from earlier, and talked to my girlfriend about it, and we came down to the conclusion that we should set some ground rules. Nothing major. The 3 rules were as followed:

1) Us coming over should not be for a compromise just to see me. It should be to celebrate my birthday and having a good time

2) refrain from political/controversial topics. While I myself understand politics make up most of today’s conversations, I’m not comfortable talking to my family about my views as they don’t respect me as a person (I’m non-binary, they’re all conservative.)

3) There will be no talk about my girlfriend’s family, as it was disrespectful to bring them up in conversation.

In short, my dad blew up on me for having the audacity to demand such “heinous things”, and told me I needed to suffer more to see what the real world was like, while my mom tried backpedaling about the stuff she said about my girlfriend’s family. Due to this, we decided that we are no longer going to attend my birthday at my parents’ house.

So I guess my question is, am I the asshole for this?"	8	18	0.75

I told her I was busy, but she kept going on, so I stared ignoring her. It was very difficult, but I managed to study. After some time she screamed at me to listen, so I figured I'd listen to 10 minutes and then go away.

When I started to study again she went crazy and said that as moh I had to help. So I said I didn't want to be in the first place and if I had to be I wouldn't prioritize their wedding over my life. She said it wasn't her problem I had some things to do that no one cares about. I snapped and I told her I don't care at all about their wedding and I wouldn't be moh and maybe not been a guest.

for reference my mother lives in a apartment with a portable washer and dryer, and my dad lives in a house with a large washer and dryer so it would just be easier to wash at my dads.

he said no, so i went about my day. at the end of the day he said he was taking me home, so i brought my laundry down to wash it. he then started yelling at me about the laundry and i got a little mad and slammed the door to my room shut. since then we have not talked.

today is my birthday and i was bombareded with texts messages from my family except him. where i live its now 6:00pm, which is very late.

i was starting to think he forgot my birthday so i looked on facebook to see if anyone reminded him. To my surprise, he had a whole post he made to all his facebook friends. i do not have facebook, i used my aunts account to look him up.

at that point i was severely hurt. he has not called or texted me once today, but he could make a facebook post?

My (17 F) twin brother ""Marcus"" (17 M) is completly obssesed with the whole Alpha Male shit. He is a big fan of Tate and Musk. Hell, he even has a whole page dedicated to them. He believes that women exist to serve men and give em' kids. Our parents enabled this behaviour because they are just as mysoginistic as he is or as they call it: ""Old School"". Today, we where with some friends and Marcus was pissed off today since a girl in our school ""Emma"" (18 F) rejected him. He started to vent w my one of our friends and name girl the poor girl. He called her a ""sl*t"", ""wh*re"", ""easy"" and ""ugly"". I started to laugh and questioned him of why he asked her out if he considers her all those things. Marcus screamed at me to shut up and to mind my own business. I laughed louder and said that he was such a loser & that he will never get a gf.

Later when our friends were gone already my dad came to me SUPER angry and began to yell at me for being rude to Marcus. Basically, Marcus told our parents that I called him a loser but he didn't tell them why. My dad even tried to take my phone but mom intervened and just send me to my room. My mom says that I was being rude and that my brother was just feeling frustrated & that I shouldn't be so harsh w him since he's on a hard phase in life.

We'd been together for about 9 happy months. I loved her and thought we had a future.

She would often play video games and chat on Discord with two of her male friends. I'd met them from the beginning, and my girlfriend told me they were simply friends. Often, I'd ask her to do things with me but she'd already made plans with them. On the last occasion, I told her I felt bit resentful when this happens. We had a call about it. 

During the call, I told her having male friends was fine and this was an issue I needed to work on internally. Yet, I did ask- have you ever felt anything for either of them? I wanted to know that they were truly platonic.

Her reply: ""With (guy A) I never have, but with (guy B), he was my friend with benefits.""

I was absolutely stunned.  I needed to think and ended the call.

Later, I called back. During this call, I laid blame on her. I told her that she'd destroyed my trust and she'd have to respect my boundaries and stop hanging out with him.

My girlfriend had always been quiet during our relationship, and said little. I kept reiterating how hurt I was, but got silence in reply. This made me feel unheard, so I asked her pointed questions.

""Would you have been okay with me hanging out with a lover and hiding it? Did you have feelings for him?"" 

(At this, I learned that she'd once had feelings and tried to date him, but he didn't want to.)

I asked her to talk tomorrow. But when it came- radio silence. I texted first:

""Are we going to communicate? Lack of communication led us here. You had every chance to tell me, but you didn't. We need to talk.""

She replied, saying that she wasn't avoiding me and was swamped with work. She said she needed time to process and wanted to talk later. I told her we needed to stop putting off the issue. She replied:

""I'm sorry that you're hurt. But I want time to process. We should talk later.""

I knew she was on lunch and had time to speak. I replied, frustrated:

""I need a sign that you care. You need to address the act itself. Hanging out with him? Hiding it and letting me find out by accident? Lying about not having feelings? If you can't address my core issues and show commitment to me, we don't share values.""

She replied after 6 hours.

""You're not respecting me. At no point during this process have I felt heard. You keep saying communication is important, but you're ignoring what I say. It's toxic. I am no longer comfortable continuing this relationship.""

I asked her if she'd at least like to talk on the phone one final time to close this chapter of our lives, and she never replied. When I woke up the following morning, I'd been blocked on every single platform.

TLDR: I found out one of my girlfriend's friends was actually a former lover, who she'd once had feelings for. I found out by accident, and had heated exchanges with her. In the end, she said I was being toxic and dumped me, then blocked me on everything.

They said this was the lowest rate but at some point let it slip that other banks didn't get back yet. I should have walked there and waited but I made a mistake and continued - now I have this crazy rate.

They were open about their 2% dealer add on and that I shouldn't pay it off until 90 days to not screw them over since they won't get their entire incentive from the bank if you do. I wasn't going to do that and planned to pay the whole thing off after 90 days despite the ridiculous interest.

After I signed all the paperwork I took the car home and noticed a huge scratch on the plastic bumper. Not a huge deal, but I just inspected the car before entering the office to do the paperwork and it wasn't there - it happened right as I was signing the paperwork that made it MY problem. It must have happened while they were cleaning it and washing it for me to go home (which happened while I was signing everything to myself).

I'm kind of annoyed by the rate and plan to get a quote from a shop to see how much it is to take the scratch out. I could use the money that would have went towards interest to fix the scratch.

My parents divorced a little over a year now. The divorce was pretty bad. My mother (49F) has a restriction order from him and started living in the family home. Since she has always been a SAHM, she doesn’t have income to keep up with all the costs of living in such a big house. I (23F) was about to move in with my boyfriend (30M) of three years but she asked us if we could go live with her in order to support each other and live more comfortably. We of course asked my brother (21M) who was still living at our family home, if it was okay for my boyfriend to move in. Since our father wasn’t paying a single thing, we could still make it work if the four of us lived together. There were available rooms, so no space was invaded. 

Now, fast forward. I could tell my brother suffered the divorce, got anxious or depressed and spent all day locked in his room. (My brother took away the door handle and closed the room with a key.) Both my mother and I tried to get him to talk or get therapy, but he didn’t want to listen. My brother enjoyed smoking weed with his friends from time to time, but since the divorce, he had been consuming every single minute of the day when he was home. The house smelled like weed all the time. His girlfriend left him and later I heard she didn’t like what he had become. When my mother wanted to clean his room or make his bed, he wouldn’t let her in, and when he did, his room was a total mess. Not only clothing on the floor, but food, dirt, garbage. He didn’t care if he lived in that kind of environment. He started answering back horribly towards me and my mom when we asked for his laundry, and we didn’t know what to do. He didn’t come down to lunch or dinner, and the car we shared was also disgusting on the inside even though I insisted he got it cleaned. He even dropped out of college. Even though he put his part of the money, he wasn’t really making our life easier. 

My mom was tired of being mistreated, so she sent him a message saying that his lifestyle wasn’t compatible with the rest of us living at the house, and that if he wanted to stay he should change his habits. If he didn’t, he should move in with our dad. He didn’t even try to change his lifestyle, but told my mother he would leave the next day. 

We expected that he would come by from time to time, visit us, our dogs, get stuff he needed, but he never did. He hasn’t answered to my mom asking how he is, nor me asking about organising our time with the car. My mom’s heart is broken, and the other day my cousin told me I was an asshole for kicking my brother out of his house. I told him how he had been behaving, and he said I shouldn’t tell my brother how to live his life.

This has been tiring asf but I can't really complain to be honest. Today it was a particularly bad day, I didn't ate anything and well, it sucked. After work I was HANGRY, stressed and I felt just awful tbh.


In my way home I called my mother and asked if she or my sister would want something to eat, my mother asked me to bring her a burger but said my pregnant sister F(23) is not hungry. very well. I entered the Burger King and bought my food and my mother's burger, I didn't buy anything for my sister or BIL because at the moment all I was thinking was getting home to eat, lol.

coming back to home I gave my mom her burger and then I sat down to eat. As I began, my sister comes to me and oh, oh, she's just craving french fries! She asked me to give her some, fine, I accepted so I avoid arguments and I gave her a handful of my french fries. More later, sis comes again and asks me (without even a ""please"") to give her the half of my burger. okay, I gave it to her because I bought a dessert. When I was eating my dessert, sister comes back and asks me to give her some. Which at this point I was pissed off asf so I told her no (not in a bad way okay). Sis proceeds to take a spoon and grab of my dessert. I told her that she was being rude as hell and that if she wanted something she could tell her bf to bring her something when he came back from work.

My sister stormed off very angry and my mother comes to me later and tells me I was being selfish & that cravings are a thing. I told my mom that if my sister was so hungry she could have grabbed something else from the kitchen or at least tell me to bring her something when I FIRSTLY CALLED THEM. My mother asked me to apologize to my sister since she is pregnant bad mood would affect the baby, I declined.

I got caught in the middle of it trying to get them to agree to a plan that everyone was comfortable with, unfortunately, my parents ended up not going to the wedding as ""they were not comfortable taking the risk for their health."" My brother could not change the wedding as they had set it up after long discussions with them and from his side thought he had my parents approval to proceed. 

As a result of this things have been tense between the whole family since. Now one of my close family friends (my dad and his dad grew up together) is getting married. He was one of my brother's groomsmen, and my brother one of his. Because of what happened between my brother and my parents at my brother's wedding, the groom decided not to invite my parents to his wedding. I assume  this was to avoid any conflict/uncomfortable encounters during the day and make my brother more comfortable. 

I live out of town and am traveling back for the wedding, my parents will be out of town for the majority of time I will be in town for the wedding except for the last night I am there. I asked my parents if I could stay at their house while I'm in town, but they told me that ""they can't help me attend a wedding for someone that chose to exclude them in an attempt to cause them pain.""  

I was planning on meeting up with my parents when they got back into town before I left, but now I question whether I should as the only reason I am going to be in town is for the wedding, so if they ""can't help me attend the wedding"" then should they also get the benefit of seeing me while I'm in town specifically for the wedding?

I'm probably overthinking this, but it just seems like a stretch to put the conflict they are having with the groom onto me.  "	1	1	1.0

One important thing to note is that I (17M) am in several honors classes and am considered “gifted.” (In reality, it was probably only because with my hicktown, the bar is set really low. I’m talking disproving Darwin’s theory of Natural Selection.) Why note this? Because many of these classes are filled to the brim with very preppy rich girls, and some of them are, by all means, “Hot Cheeto Girls.”

Meanwhile, I get to my LiM period, which is kind of like a morality and self-fulfillment class. Normally, it’s a chance to get away from those extroverted and vain girls, even if I’m stuck in there with future criminals.

So a Friday comes, and those preppy girls invade and use our room for homecoming discussion. The discussion was so loud and disorganized that I’m surprised we even heard anyone think. But I never felt heard. What was I thinking? Either the 90s or 2000s, and I was eyeing the Y2K aesthetic. I could imagine the cyan, chrome, hallmarks to CGI, all that jazz. But they picked the 50s. And it wasn’t me against the whole class. They only won with like a 30% majority. It was basically those girls that decided it would be the 50s, and whenever I spoke, I fell on deaf ears.

It infuriated me that I was ignored like that. So the next week, they come back, and this time, I try to speak up, and the best idea I could think of was a TV, which became mainstream in the 50s. A unanimous no.

This week, I was in Spanish with those girls again. When I tried to say why, I said it was because I thought the 50s were the worst decade. If you ask me, it was a time of repression and inequality that felt wrong to celebrate. And it also gave us the boomers that ruined everything. But then I was told it was the aesthetic and that I’m over analyzing. So I tried to say that I also felt that 50s aesthetics were the lamest, but again, deaf ears. And the bell ringing.

So why might I be wrong? I feel like I came off as self-righteous, and that my resentment is petty. I also get where they come from - the 50s were a time of strong economic prosperity and comfy living. And we have a lot of boomers in this town. So judge me on one question: Am I the Asshole?"	1	1	1.0

We haven’t talked in over a year because I don’t want to and I don’t want a relationship. I feel that every interaction with my brother leads to a competition where he in some way trying to prove he is better than me. I realize that part of this is because he truly is insecure but he is more successful in every measurable way. He has more money. He has a family. I’m a divorced single person who works for my mom. 

I stopped talking to him because after years of  feeling self conscious about my life events I realized that he never really respected me as a person and it wasn’t going to change. I mean respect in the sense of sincerely wants me to be able to grow and develop as a person. Every time I ever took a step in any direction from learning skills  for work to playing games my brother made an effort to show he could do what ever I can do but better. The problem is he started to monopolize my time. He expected me to play games with him every night. Then even while I was homeless every night would turn into an hour of him complaining about his life. We would talk but if I shared things I was struggling with he would basically tell me that it’s because I’m stupid and should just work for him despite him not having a business.


This wasn’t a huge issue. I kinda just dealt with it  because I felt I was a loser  and I didn’t recognize it but then my dad got cancer. I move in with my parents. I start seeing how I’m going through a real challenge and instead of trying to help me most of the time my brother tries to prove he is superior. Not only in success but even in struggle. Like his life is multiples harder because he has kids and I’ll never know real struggle.

Then the night before my dad dies I call my brother and I tell him I’m worried I want to take my dad to the hospital. He goes off how my dad ruined his life and is an addict to prescription drugs and attention. My dad dies that night. I don’t blame my brother for my dads death but it clicked that no matter what I went through or really did my brother was never going to treat me or my life with respect. For months after I did have a relationship with him but I saw more and more how I was constantly being told I was less than and deserved to be treated as someone who was inferior.

 So one day I pointed it out. I told him that he was being disrespectful to me.

My brother told me I was brainwashed. That I should do what he wants because I have no dreams and that I abandoned my ex wife so since I’m such a failure at relationships there was no way he was being disrespectful to me. 

So I stopped talking to him and his family. I don’t want to put them in the middle so I simply stopped interacting. 

He sent me a postcard with an apology “for their part.” No details or specifics.

He tagged me in their fb post… I don’t even want to like it."	1	1	1.0

I love my dog of 6 months , I do the best that I can for him. I cannot say that I'm perfect but I try my best to make good informed decisions on how to raise my dog. 

I was walking today with him on a longer lead as I am trying to ease him into recall. We were walking in a forested area that had some bushes and a path in the middle also quite hilly.  

 I was walking along with my dog when a guy suddenly approaches me and tells me how dangerous it is, what I'm doing and that I'm abusing my dog and finally how animal welfare could get involved, have I no consideration etc.

 I stopped and ask what he was talking about and he referred to my long leash he said it could ""get tangled on his legs and break them because he's a puppy and wants to play"". 

At first I tried to hear his side and I asked him what he'd suggest in place of the long leash and he suggested a retractable leash like he uses. I said I'm trying to ease him into recall so I need something that works similarly. 

He then dismissingly tells me to Google it and I said hey you clearly ave a much older dog so perhaps more experience if you do have an alternative I'm open to hearing it and learning if im doing something wrong.

 He then says ""you're young enough why don't you google it and you can find the answers. Surely you know how to use google right?"". 

I then said well given you're here talking about everything I'm doing wrong with no solutions, you just came to pass a comment and leave. 

He then calls me an AH and I decide he's not worth an escalation so I leave the area. 

Now I don't think he was completely wrong on his advice in of itself. I did see some sort of a point then looked online about some arguments for and against the long leash.  I'm doing my homework about the long leash incase I could be wrong or was advised wrong but what got to me was the sheer dismissal and the way he just came in at 100% telling me how bad I was being with 0 solutions. 

I want to learn and I want to be able to do things right so often times I question myself and thought this time I'll leave it to this subreddit. 

So everyone , AITA?



TLDR: guy tries to advise me on how to train my dog claiming my use of the long leash is dangerous , doesn't offer solutions. I point this out , get called an AH and leave."	1	1	1.0

Me being scared would say no we are just close friends, and she would always reassure me it was fine if we were and it was normal nowadays. Well, on one sunday I finally decided to tell her, and let me say all hell broke lose. She took my phone and told me that, ""I wasnt her daughter"", ""Im a disappointment"", and that ""I was wrong for being that way"". After saying that she left the house and didnt come back for at least an hour. That morning before school me and her said some words to eachother, and lets just say I walked into school BAWLING. I wasnt able to go to class all day and had to sit in the nurses office until my grandmother was able to come pick me up.

 Me and girl decided to never break up, no matter what my mother said. She was someone I was comfortable around and genuinely had feelings for. After the first incident happened my mom kept me from talking to girl on my phone, so I had girl give me one of her old ones and we talked that way. I kept lying and lying to my mom as I was scared that everything would repeat again. Well...you guessed it, it did and it was BAD. To make a long story short I was completely isolated from everyone in the middle of summer, my mom took my phone and left me home by myself for atleast two weeks. Everyday we would argue and it got to the point where I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown and ended up leaving my home state to go see my dad for a week. 

I To make this story shorter this cycle repeated for 4 years. I always ended up lying to my mom and finding some way to talk to girl. I know to this day the lying was wrong and I could see how my mom could be upset. There was so much I left out to make the story shorter, but I added the key aspects so you could get the gist. My mom REFUSES to let me see, speak, or even think about dating girl in her eyes as she thinks girl is manipulative and going to lead me down the wrong path. My mom got this from all the lies I told. I told so many, so many to her, to girl, and to other people just so I didnt  have to go through what I went through. I try to tell my mom that girl is not like that at all, girl actually pulled me out of a bad place, helped me through 2 tragic deaths, helped me get a job, helped me apply to college, helped me through depression, and so much more. Girl is the only person I am genuinely close with and I have so much love for her and can see a future with her. Ive told my mom this numerous times and she just doesnt listen.  "	1	1	1.0

They’d been dating on and off for 2 years. To put it into perspective, none of his friends approved of her and she doesn’t/hasn’t tried to connect with his family… she’s very 2 faced and gives off mean girl energy. Her kids are extremely disrespectful to him and their guest, and she does nothing. When he tells them to stop she gets upset with him (yet he doesn’t even yell).
  We have wholeheartedly supported his decision until this last year. He’s been getting progressively more sick from drinking (he’s diagnosed with Cirrhosis) and it is obvious!! He has yellow eyes from liver failure, loss of appetite, extreme bloating, and can’t go to work sometimes. She doesn’t know??! 
   Meanwhile his wife does absolutely nothing, she hordes her money, while he pays all the bills and utilities, and for her 2 kids expenses, even sending her money for stuff she doesn’t need. She doesn’t clean, cook, or do anything around the house. He makes less than her and she refuses to help him pay bills because ‘if he needs my help he’ll ask’. 
 We went to help him move this past weekend. All the stuff he was responsible for, he had packed and ready. There was unwashed cloths everywhere, her children’s rooms were not packed, and their bunk beds were not disassemble, plus she lost the tools to do so.
   5 people came to help them move, and she proceeded to hide away in their room, not even trying to pack or move ANYTHING. Everyone was extremely frustrated, but couldn’t say a thing. It took 9 hours and they still haven’t moved out before their designated day. The house was in horrendous shape when we left, smelled like dog pee, clothes everywhere and his wife absolutely useless."	1	1	1.0

My sister (41F) calls us to move into her house with her and daughter (9F). She's divorcing her husband. Our landlord would not break lease, so we paid it off, along with the new rent. Our studio apt was not left in good condition. We were going through depression, meds not working , I stopped which made it worse. Dishes piled up, stopped vacuuming, etc. Sister offered to clean it. We paid nearly $700. We were grateful and she needed the money.  
  
I cosigned the mortgage loan for her. She told us we would pay 50% for everything, mortgage/utilities. Also bought salt for water tank which came to like $80 every 6 weeks. We bought laundry detergent/sheets for the house. She bought TP & paper towels. My sister's bf (50+M) moved in. It all went downhill.  
  
Every room in the house has cameras except bedrooms/bathrooms. Also 4 cameras outside, ""security purposes"". Yet, she watches us on the camera constantly. She would message at 3am, ""You left the fridge cracked open I saw on the camera"" etc. We did not like being recorded 24/7, so we spent 95% of our time in our bedroom. She would not give us access to the cameras either because, ""we might delete something"". She told us we could drink/eat food, but not her daughter's school snacks. She has a LINK card. We did drink milk and eat food, which apparently she recorded. She's been telling people we are ""stealing"". Never said anything to us.  
  
We're not allowed to know the code to the thermostat. We did open our bedroom windows when it got too hot, and she would get mad that we were wasting money. We used to have a garage opener, but she gave it to her bf along with my parking spot in the driveway. Now I park in the road. She said I was ""too big to park in the driveway"" (I'm 200lbs) My sister is very OCD in her cleaning. We paid an extra $150 a month . But then we would hear her on the phone complaining. Never once mentioning she gets paid to do it.  
  
My sister does not like animals on anything that is not the floor. She bought ""animal shock pads"" and every time our cats jumped on the pads, they got shocked. We found out she had taken pictures of our old apt and showed friends/family and talked very badly about us. There was a party days after one of our cats passed away. We stayed 30 min, but we were sad & left. She showed people on her camera that we are ""at home eating food and playing video games and we don't even look sad"".  
  
ALSO found out, the mortgage was $1550 a month. We pay $1300 plus all the extra things. Also her bf has never paid rent/utilities. The one thing I ""did"" was put an empty milk jug on my 1/6th of the fridge.  
  
She went to UK with her bf weeks later, and we got a call from a condo and moved out. Now she is telling the family that I ""moved out without telling her and how will she afford the house"". I do not want to talk to her anymore and want nothing to do with her for AT LEAST several years. AITA?"	1	1	1.0

My mom believed that if you let children take care of themselves they will develop better, so she stopped doing things for me and my brother when I was six and he was 9 and my father never really cared so he just went along with her. She gave us money every week, made sure we had food, clean clothes, came with us to doctors appointments (though she stopped coming when we were 14 as that the age you can start going to the doctors appointments alone in my country) we had a cleaning lady come once a week but other than that were on our own. I had to teach myself how to make me and my brother food while he had to take me home from school in the first month of my first year until I mesmerised the way which made him miss a whole period a day as we lived 20 minutes away. Our childhood was not bad by any means, we had everything money could buy us, great friends, a roof over our heads and food and water but both of us don’t really see our parents as our parents, they didn’t raise us, they barely even talked to us.

I graduated college last school year but didn’t have a graduation party until yesterday because me and my brother were backpacking (is that what it’s called?) and only got back a week ago.

Something you should know, our parents paid for our college and an apartment we’re sharing next to the college (we’re both in the same one), and gave us monthly leisure money. Both me and my brother had a part time job during college and since my brother graduated he have a real job, but we didn’t need to use the money on anything so all of it is just sitting in a bank account and as you can imagine we have quite a lot by now.

When my parents saw the pictures from the party in my Instagram this morning they called me, yelling that they’re the only reason I was able to go to college and that I should have invited them and saying that they will stop paying for us.

Honestly I didn’t even think that they will want to come.

I told them that while they helped I graduated because of my hard work and that they never cared about being there for me before so they shouldn’t care now, I also told them that they cutting us off isn’t something to threaten us with as we have enough money to be just fine.

I think it’s important to know that since we moved out we only talked to our parents once a month for like 10 minutes.

I feel bad for how I talked to them and not inviting them since without their money I probably would have needed to take a gap year so I could work, live a broken college student life and take out student lawns.

The thing is, anytime I’m feeling upset it’s pretty visual and he asks me what’s wrong, now that by itself isn’t a problem, but I dismiss him because it is usually about my ED and he told me he didn’t want to hear about that stuff. I have also expressed my discomfort in venting at all but he just won’t let up until I talk to him… eventually I do and then I just spill everything that’s been on my mind and it gets to some really heavy stuff. 

He said that it makes it harder for him to recover when he hears about that kind of stuff but won’t let up when I say I don’t want to tell him what’s wrong. Now he’s saying that next time I make him feel that way he will not be talking to me anymore and I’m so scared to lose him but I can’t help but feel like this could be partially his fault.

Last September my cat Loki passed away after getting hit by a car. I was devastated. I was a crying mess and i wasn't lucid. After asking some neighbors to move his body in a box so i could bury him i realized i couldn't bury him in my garden (since its not enough deep for bury things). So i called my grandma asking her if she could bury him in her garden since its bigger. She accepted and said before closing the call ""c'mon stop crying now"".

 After she came to my house for get the box she comes inside and wraps an arm around my shoulder and said ""c'mon stop weeping and crying. it's just a cat. You'll get a new one. Get over this"". I was a bit mad but i didn't pay mind to it. After 10 minutes that she went back to her house with the box she calls me all worried saying ""i don't think i can bury your cat. If my neighbors see that i'm burying something they might get suspicious and sue me. I don't want the police to fine me"". After she said that i checked online to see what the law said. The law said that its not illegal to bury a cat or a pet in a garden. You just have to dig 4 meters underground so other animals don't dig up the body. So i assured my grandma that she wasn't going to get fined. Then she started complaining that she called HER vet because she wanted to bring my cat to the vet for get ir cremated. I told her that its not what I WANTED. So she kept complaining about herself and the fact that she will be fined, despite me telling her that she wasn't going to, then she told me to stop crying and get over it already. I admit i wasn't lucid and i yelled at her, i cussed her out and told her that i was trusting her with my cat's burial. 

After my mom came home i told her what happend and initially she was on my side. She went to take the box back and brought it to another person (a family's friend) and she buried him in his garden. After some days my mom tried to convince my grandma to apologize to me for how she treated me but she complained that i should be the one apologizing for how i talked back at her. My mom tried but she wasn't successful. 

After some weeks my mom was annoyed by the fact that i didn't want to talk to my grandma anymore. When one time my brother (17m) tried to explain to my grandma that she had to apologize she insisted that she didn't remember what happened but that i should still apologize. She pretends nothing happend and that she is in the right. So i keep refusing to talk to my grandma. Now my mom is on her side and wants me to ""get over this silly argument"".

They say it’s alright cuz they have been together since they were both minors but I never supported their relationship and openly criticized him for his dating choice.

On top of that they have a very toxic relationship where they both have cheated on each other previously. The girl is super possessive of him and hates that he is friendly with me, hence he blocked me for 2 years from all social media handles, deleting my number and so on…

We coincidentally met again couple of months ago, he apologized and we decided to put things in the past and continue staying friends.

A week ago I made a plan to meet up and hang out along with our other mutual friends as its been a while, and without informing anyone he brings out his girlfriend saying they got back together. We didn’t say anything as he never listens. My bestf and I decided to leave early as it was too awkward, he stopped us and asked if we could drop his gf on our way home. She is still 17, and out of kindness I decided to drop her off as it was pretty late at night. The entire drive down she did not have the curtesy to say Hi, reply to our attempts to make a convo, and left slamming the door without thanking me.

I was pretty pissed and in a conversation bought it up with my friend telling him how ungrateful his gf is and she should have atleast said thanks for which he defended her stating “why would she ever thank a person she hates very much, she had no choice but to get into your car, you should understand how bad it was for her”

I just left and regretted ever befriending him again. Then Yesterday we ran into each other again, and he asked me to drop them off to their location as its on my way, I refused and told them to book a fuking taxi, saying I am not their driver and I soo dont want to have an ungrateful bitch who hates me so much in my car. (I may have sounded rude)

His girlfriend was upset, and now he has been going around telling all our friends how much of an asshole I am, was I ?"	1	1	1.0

I (20F) have been dating my bf (20M) since we were in high school. He was on the quieter side and only really hung out with the same few people in school, while I have always been more outgoing and had/have a lot of friends. I'm not trying to criticize his socializing skills or anything, just giving some background about our personalities.

Anyways, over the past couple years I've been steadily growing an Instagram presence and have become a bit of an ""influencer"" if you will. I get invited to fancy parties sometimes because of this and this has started some conflict between me and my bf.

I of course want my bf to come with me to these parties, but here's the problem. He's not the most fashion forward, and he'll show up to parties wearing something basic like jeans and a button-up shirt. My followers all know me for my sense of style and the influencer circles I run in are also fashion-related, so it's a bit embarrassing for both him and me when he comes to parties dressed like that. I've seen my friends and peers side-eyeing him and it's honestly just so mortifying.

This all came to a head last night when one of my influencer guy friends, I'll call him Jason, made a comment about my bf's clothing at a party we were at. He wasn't super mean or anything, just noted how my bf looks out of place and teased a little bit about how he even got an invite. For comparison, Jason always dresses super nicely and always looks very sharp. I just kind of laughed and joked about how he must've just wandered in, and I admittedly did kind of avoid my bf for the rest of the night.

This morning, I got a text from my bf asking me if everything was okay cuz I was kind of distant last night. I didn't even really know what to say at first, but finally just decided to tell him straight up that he needs to start dressing more appropriately for these parties or else I won't invite him to them anymore. He hasn't responded since.

AITA for that comment? I can see how it could be misunderstood or misconstrued to be kind of rude, but I just want to look out for him so he doesn't embarrass himself in front of my friends."	1	1	1.0

It's to the point now where she is very bossy and tells my daughter what to do, wants every thing another child has, doesn't listen (because she's always been enabled to not listen), she will beat my daughter to a toy to get it first and if they play she plays games where she's the teacher or the mum and bosses everyone around, if they play with barbies she will quickly grab the ones she wants and give my daughter the ones she doesnt want and if my daughter doesnt want to play with that one she tells her ""no we are playing this"" anyway you get the picture. 

i decided to keep my distance because i really cant handle it and my daughter gets upset and i dont want my daughter to be forced to be around another child like that family or not. my husband told her that we need to sit down and talk about how we parent when they kids are together and she lost it at him and told him very hurtful things about him and about me. he ended up leaving because she was screaming at him.

I ended up messaging her about my side and how i felt and how draining it is and how i dont have the energy to be around it and she went off at me too. said hurtful things to me aswell and told me there is nothing wrong with her daughter or the way she is and then started attacking me and my kids. am i wrong for wanting to be distant from these people?"	1	1	1.0

After getting my costume today, he got upset that I had an outfit and he didn’t. I explained that I have been wanting this outfit regardless because I like to cosplay, and if I didn’t order it that day then I wouldn’t have anything at all (last year was a mess because he had a $200 anakin costume and I had to last minute diy a padme outfit). I explained that I have been asking for weeks what he has wanted to do because he thought all of my ideas were lame. He then suggested him being a doctor and me being his mental patient. I got a little offended at this because I had suggested doing the operation game (denied) last time I saw him, and he often mentions my mental health problems (which we both have). I told him that I didn’t like that he suggested that, and I told I’m not dressing up as an insult to myself. He then went back to how my costume and my ideas were lame and “geeky” and started to yell at me.
We’re on call, so the volume of his voice was debatable, but it was clear he was getting frustrated. I have a lot of problems with being yelled at due to childhood trauma, and he knows this, but usually I can handle it. I urgently told him to stop yelling at me and that I will not be yelled at by him. He explained he started yelling because I had cut him off 3 or 4 times within half a sentence, but I hadn’t opened my mouth. I said that maybe one of our sides were lagging because that is a frequent problem. He then told me to stop gaslighting him and calling him abusive. I was very confused at this comment so I said “I’m just setting a boundary. I shut down when I’m yelled at, especially when I don’t believe I did anything wrong.” I also explained that I never called him abusive, but he said I was insinuating it because I set a boundary. I explain how that didn’t make sense, and he followed it up with “setting a boundary means it has happened repeatedly.” I told him that was not the case and I just have childhood trauma from it. He said that we weren’t talking about the past and that has nothing to do with what we were talking about, but I said it did because that is why I told him to stop yelling. The moment it had started, I was already shaking and could barely get a sentence out. He told me then that it was my own problem and something I need to work on because he doesn’t have any issues asking someone to stop nicely. He followed this all with “is this relationship even worth it?” He then said I should apologize for telling him to stop yelling at me and to take accountability for the fact I cut him off when I don’t believe I did, and I believe if it sounded like it was a technological error which I already said could have been from both or either side, and I had apologized if it sounded like I had cut him off.  I am currently in tears because I don’t know if what I said was wrong.  I’m just very confused and not sure what to think. AITAH?"	3	7	0.71

I am getting married next October. I recently purchased a wedding dress. It’s black. I absolutely adore it. I have an alternative style. This is not news to anyone. My fiancé knew it was possible I might get black. He was totally on board. But it was a surprise, I wasn’t going to tell him what color I got.  Anyways. Mother in law asked if I got a dress. I said yes. That it’s black. I didn’t even SHOW her a photo. She is Filipino and catholic so I knew she would not like my dress but I made my choice anyway. It’s my dress, not hers. I fully expected her to tell me she does not like it, that’s fine. But she started to freak out, saying my dress MUST be white and it absolutely CANNOT be black. I told her no it IS black. She asked if my fiancé knew. I told her that he knew it was a possibility but that it’s a surprise for our wedding day. She said no that I have to tell him and that he will hate the dress. She then asked if my mom had seen the dress. I said yes and she likes it. She said and I quote “no she doesn’t like it, and if your dad were still alive, he would hate your dress.” For some context; my dad passed away from cancer 3 months ago. I helped care for him on hospice until he passed away. We were very close so his death has been devastating to say the least. I am still greatly grieving and even typing this hurts my heart and brings tears to my eyes. She is FULLY aware of the whole situation. I know she hasn’t “forgotten” this because right before this awful conversation, she asked me “you’re always sad, quiet, and depressed, is it cause you’re still grieving?” No SHIT. “You lost weight, is it cause your dad died?” No SHIT. So for her to say that was beyond below the belt. I feel like I hate her, and will never like her. After she said that to me, I went into my room and shut the door. She proceeded to text me 3 more times saying “your daddy will not be happy to see you in that dress” , “you can do a pastel color too, just not black.” and also “what dress should I wear?” Like I give a shit after what she said. I called fiance crying because the comments about my dad deeply upset me. Mind you, she has never even met my parents, not once. I know my dad knows me, loves me, is proud of me, and would think I looked pretty. He knows me and that I would choose something black. My mom thinks it’s pretty! My fiancé came home and bitched her out and told her to not speak to me like that, he told me she tried to apologize to him but he told her she needs to apologize to me, which she still hasn’t. She also told him my dress is black and spoiled the surprise. He apologized profusely and told me we did not have to invite her to the wedding if I do not wish to. This also happened 2 days ago so I am still emotional. So, WIBTA to not invite her? 
TL;DR; WIBTA to not invite my MIL to our wedding because she told me my father who passed away 3 months ago (she’s fully aware) would hate my wedding dress because it’s black?"	7	25	0.77

 My friend and I were making jokes about schizophrenia saying dumb shit

what I didn’t know is that he (only claims to have taken) one and sent it to my other friend while we’re talking without getting my permission or telling me.

 My friend calls me and tells my how fucking weird I am, how I need to get a life etc. 

I don’t know how many screenshots he took and sent to him but when I asked him about it he said it was only the message of me saying “the voices are so loud😜”.

 I don’t care about what was in the message but I feel less trust in him because 1, he didn’t tell me. 2, he got absolutely no permission or consent. 3, imagine if it was something bad or serious.

 I do want to be friends with him but he’s kind of broken my trust and I know 100% i haven’t done anything to offend or hurt him because he hasn’t told me about anything and I can confidentially say I haven’t 

Tbh I’m just kind of pissed about it and I’ve decided I’m not gonna talk to him unless he apologises and proves that he means it. I know this might make me seem a bit dramatic because I will say myself I’m going a little over the top but I’ve heard many stories of this going wrong

I (21F) went to my boyfriend's (20M) dorm for valentines since he was busy with something and I had no classes that time. Initially he told me that he would make it special, but all we did is hang out with his friends (This is the first time I met them), and the next day he didn't even take me out because he had a presentation and wanted to prepare for it with his friends. I went home early that time and my disappointment was evident to him, and when I got back home it sparked a big fight between us. He told me that I didn't appreciate all that he could give at the moment and that he wasn't as important to me as he thought he was, because even if he didn't have the time of day he still accommodated me. I told him I didn't appreciate that he didn't really make it special and it was just another routine stay at his place. I feel like I'm the asshole because I didn't appreciate his effort.

He “asked” me what I thought about the purchase at the time and I strongly advised against it. I told him I know hardly anything about car buying but buying a car for about $25,000 sight unseen seemed like a bad idea. He pushed back a bit and insisted that this was his dream car and he could make the payments. We went back and forth for a while about it until it ended with me telling him that he can do it if he really wants but if it ends up being a bad idea or having problems that he shouldn’t come crawling to me for help and he agreed. Fast forward to now, 2 years later. The car has had nothing but problems and has been going back and forth to the dealership (we live hundreds of miles from a certified repair shop) and has cost us thousands in repairs. It is currently sitting in our garage and has been for about 6 months. Meaning that we have one much older car that drives our whole family around and he continues to make payments on a car that doesn’t work. Last year, my end of year bonus from work paid for repairs on this car and again this year it is looking like I will be spending it on the car again. I’m over it- my dad lives far away and is going through chemo and i want to spend my bonus to visit him. AITA for refusing to use my bonus on his car?	1	1	1.0

They both helped eachother with the monthly payments. I had my own car that was paid off at the time that I was using. Around the time they finished paying their car off, I lost my car and I began using theirs. 
My brother at that time lost his job so he wasn't helping with gas, and I only put gas whenever the car needed it, whenever I used it. 
Eventually after some time that car broke down and my grandparents considered it a goner, and they wanted to finance a new car. They had asked me to pitch in 500 for the down payment and I only did so because I would be using this car too. So after about a month of having the new car it breaks down and it's a major issue that we won't have fixed for a good while. Luckily we got our old car fixed and we had something to use, and I still have always paid for gas and my brother now has a job to help out again too. The new car is just sitting and has been sitting for 2 months now. My grandparents asked me to help them pay the car payment for the new car, and I refused. I told them I'm not paying a payment for a car I don't use. I wouldn't mind if I had it made financially but I don't, I struggle with my finances myself. 
My grandparents told me that it's technically my car too and as we pay for it eventually we'll get it fixed too and that I'll be using that one soon too, and I'm just like they're both your guyses cars, neither of them are mine I'm just using them.

He lost his job a few months ago and has not even gotten an interview since then. He can't get unemployment because he was previously told a claim for losing a different job was not actually valid and would have to pay them back. We filed an appeal, but when the judge called him he was in a steel building at his new job and did not get the call. So he just owes the state and says he can't file for unemployment for this more recent issue. 

I have been the breadwinner since 2016. The first period of unemployment lasted 2 years, and he was depressed and not looking for work. During that time we also hosted my stepchildren for an entire summer (increase in food and electricity costs etc.). I made myself sick with resentment and was not kind towards him when the unemployment ran out and he was not looking for work but instead escaping into hobbies. I was pretty emasculating and accused him of being immature, etc.

When he lost this more recent job, he said that he would keep it together and not fall apart like he did before. Ok, so far so good. But currently he is spiraling into a depression. At first he was doing projects around the house and keeping busy but I have had to oversee and manage SO MUCH because his adhd is severe and he does not have good coping strategies. He takes medication and is working with a coach. 

He lost this job about 2 weeks after we agreed for one of my stepchildren to move in with us fulltime at the request of her mother. So we have an extra person here, and are down to just my income. I get along fine with my stepkid but I am overwhelmed at the pressure I am under.

Long story shorter, about a week ago I lost it. I pointed out how hard it is to carry everything, to remain functional and also do his executive functioning for him. I was angry so I also pointed out that it is because of me that he has the nice life he has, as left on his own his criminal history would have caused him to struggle to get housing and to fit into the community & being married to me is like a halo he can wear.

I am trying so hard to be patient and understanding but he is not functioning without oversight for task management, and then also not being my emotional support. I did not marry him to be provided for. I did marry him expecting emotional support. He's just not there for me in ANY way consistently.

Now he is spiraling into a depression due in part to things I said when I have tried to protect him and respect the level of avoidance he wants to use. But he is also depressed and disabled mentally and I feel like an asshole for not being kinder and more compassionate. I had a meltdown a couple days ago and he was there for me, but the tables turn and I'm just like where do I find the emotional energy to take care of him in this new way, when I am already taking care of him in so many other ways?"	2	9	0.75

He recently took on a new job a few weeks ago, which pays monthly, so he’s been struggling while waiting for the pay check. We were supposed to be meeting for dinner next week but he keeps complaining about how he doesn’t have much money, only £60 and can’t really afford to. 

Despite also struggling myself, I was going to offer to cover him when he then made a comment about how he has a few hundred in his savings and £400 in his overdraft but he doesn’t want to use it because then it will come out his wages. This just pissed me off. I currently have £600 in the bank with bills soon to come out. I only make a maximum of £200 a week at my job because I don’t have the time to work anymore alongside my college classes. He earns about £500 a week and will be getting paid £2000+ once his wages come in. He has also never helped me out when i’ve been struggling (although maybe he’s not realised how much i’ve been struggling at times as I do tend to downplay it).

I received the mail of the tenants that live here before me for quite a while and was very familiar with the names. I always wrote return to sender and then eventually it trickled away and vanished. I was fine with that and understood it would take a while to change.

After 8 months, the mail was gone, but I started getting mail with a new name on it. Apparently a new tenant moved into the complex and put my address as hers through the USPS. I took it to the office and let them know, and they informed the person. 

For 2 months it was just her bills and a bit of spam from banks. At 3 months, she had a package delivered to my address. I once again told the office that she is getting her address wrong and sending things to my place. They said they would talk to her. 

However, a month ago a new magazine subscription showed up along with some Christian newsletters. I told the office again about it. It was only 2 at first. Then more and more started showing up. In half a week, my mailbox has ended up entirely full to where there was no room for me to get my own mail. 

I just talked to my office and drew the line that I'm going to have to file for mail fraud because it shouldn't be my job to go down to the post office (I looked online and I have no recourse through their website or their phone line for this type of matter, and the post office in town will not answer the phone) to tell them that she doesn't live there. In fact the office has told the mailman that she doesn't live in my apartment, and it is still getting delivered. 

I wouldn't have a problem with it if it were just like her bills being forwarded wrong and small envelopes of spam. I would just keep returning to sender. It has reached a point however that I can't get my mail. There is no room in the mailbox at all in *HALF A WEEK*. Her husband/relative has also just started using my address as well as of this week when I was not receiving any of his mail before.

It seems very much like this person continues to sign up for more and more things despite *knowing* that the address is wrong and has recently signed her husband/relative up for my address as well. All of their mail--literally all of what a person should be receiving on a regular basis and more--is ending up at my address. 

The office said that she applied for an address change through the post office, but the fact that they had just started sending her husband/relative's mail has me highly doubting that story as it's unlikely that the guy just received absolutely no mail for 4 months.

I have grown incredibly agitated with having to be this person's personal mailman. I have mostly been returning to sender, so they haven't been receiving it on time for months. I'm tired of being their personal spam filter. I feel justified in reporting them because it seems entirely like they are actively just using my address instead of their own.

So, AITAH or is this a fair reaction?"	1	1	1.0

My friends and I (26) have been hanging out since our high school years. We've been friends for almost a decade now and our group kinda expanded because of partners which is amazing since everybody in this group has a pretty similar vibe.  
The problem started a year ago when I had a pretty big fight with the fiancee ""Jane"" of one of my best friends ""Sam"". Jane and I were actually quite close but there were several issues that I had with Jane. Starting with her having a problem with me hooking up with a guy at the party (for which I had to apologize later to make things ok again), spreading rumors about me and my other friend (I found out about this rumor through this friend SISTER) ending at shaming a guy I wanted to invite to one of our game-nights and the list goes on. Every time we had a situation like this I was kinda brushing it off since when it's a one-time situation it's not a big deal but enough is enough. So I confronted Jane at one of our meetings and it didn't end up well. At the end of the party, I was the villain again and it was me who had a problem with her, not the other way around. That kinda hurt so after that party I decided I would not be the first to smooth out the situation again. Sam and Jane started to avoid some parties and meetings I was invited to as well and when we saw each other we didn't really talk. Jane and I at least.  
A few days ago my mum asked me if I was coming home for the occasion. I said no since I wasn't expecting to be invited. She asked me if I was at least going to the church to wish them the best. That's when I started wondering. Should I go? Sam and I have known each other for a very long time and we used to be super close so yeah, I would like to be there for him and wish him the best despite all the things that happened.   
I asked my other friend for his opinion on this matter and he was LIVID. Turns out they invited for this wedding ALL of our friends. Not only our group but also friends of our friends who are occasionally showing up at our gatherings. I'm the only one not invited. I mean.. It's a clear sign that they don't want me there, right? It sucks and I would love to be there for Sam but as I'm writing this I'm starting to think it's not the best idea to go. This day is supposed to be about them, their happiness, not the beef they have with some friend.  
So yeah, I would like to go cause I know I will feel bad for not wishing them the best and it hurts to not be able to be there for someone so important to me. But I don't think I should since everyone else is invited and I would be clearly causing a scene by showing up there. For my friend ( who happens to be the best man) it's exactly the reason why I should go. ""Go, make him feel guilty for not inviting you. It's not only Jane's wedding. You should be there"" I disagree. I don't want him to feel guilty or stupid on his wedding day. 

So? AITA for wanting to attend? "	1	1	1.0

Also apologies for formatting but I'm on mobile and trying to do this quickly and quietly.

WIBTA if I didn't help my friend and his wife from becoming homeless? I'm pretty sure I'm not but I'm feeling really conflicted and could use some perspective.

A close friend of mine (we'll call him Gary) and his wife (Sam) are about to lose their home. They have 3 adult roommates but only two of them are employed and one is refusing to pay any rent, she also didn't notify anyone when she was served eviction papers by the landlord. Gary spoke with the landlord and they made a deal that if he could pay the months rent plus some of the back rent in 3 days time that they could stay and if not then they will be escorted off the property by police.
Gary and Sam are only a couple hundred short and I could easily afford to assist them but I have bailed Gary out of situations he could have easily not gotten himself into so many times in the past that I question if I'm really helping at this point. Over the last few years I've easily given two thousand dollars to him because of multiple different situations he needed money to get out of and he always seems to end up worse off and asking me for more money (and no he's never paid any of it back). I do want to help them, they're not in a particularly warm state and they have an infant, but I feel like my previous efforts to help have gone without him learning anything besides I'll bail him out and I don't want that to be what our friendship is.

Still, I’ll try my best.

I, 14F, have always had a couple issues regarding food. When I was younger I always struggled with things that made kids your average picky eater and always refused to eat certain foods. As the years went on, though, I began to develop a very recognizable pattern that steered off the simply “picky” route. I would try literally everything from frog legs to chicken hearts (which are actually so good when done right) but felt nauseous when it came to simpler things.

A couple examples of foods I don’t like are mashed potatoes, overcooked pasta, spaghetti, cooked peppers and most things mushy. The texture puts me off and always makes me feel an ick. It’s hard to explain but my body sort of just cringes whenever there’s a texture that puts me off. I think that’s called sensory issues?

Anyways, back to the story at hand. My father, 42M, never cooked much. He grew up pretty wealthy (trust me I’ve been to his family house) and had maids that cooked for him since that’s normal where we’re from. However, now that we’ve moved to the US and he’s a single father it’s either him or me that cooks for my two siblings; 12M & 5F. He doesn’t eat much himself due to a condition so he often just grabs some sort of protein bar but when it’s our cooking we NEED to eat his food. Otherwise we go to sleep hungry.

I get the premise of these rules and how they go with the unhealthy foods are bad sort of formula but despite my constant attempts to tell him about my issues regarding food he always ignores them. I often just cook myself or don’t eat when this happens but today I was really hungry. I was feeling off in the morning so I couldn’t eat and was about to make myself food when my father stopped me. He claimed he was making a soup. When I looked in the pot what I saw made me sick to the stomach.

A few days ago he got kfc and had some leftovers. Due to this he just dumped all the chicken into a pot of lukewarm water and let it simmer. Breading and all. There were even several fries in it and the water was brown. I swear I was going to vomit there and then.

Of course soggy bread doesn’t go down well with me or really any bread at all. Since I was little I’d almost always remove breading off sandwiches and burgers, wouldn’t eat lots of fried food or anything. Therefore I asked if I could just make my own food. 

As some of you may have guessed my father declined claiming that I needed to eat what was in the fridge because people were starving out there and I’m being selfish.

When I began to argue with him as I was really hungry he started on how I can’t cook in the first place and how he is the adult and expert. He then began linking the conversation on to how I haven’t done anything around the house for days so I shouldn’t get a say in anything. (This is untrue and I can confirm it by saying I had babysat for my siblings the day before, cleaned up the dishes, done the laundry and took down some boxes down to our furnace room.) The only argument he had on the matter was that I hadn’t emptied one of the cats littler (I have diagnosed adhd so it’s easy for me to forget one or two of my chores)

He eventually got so mad that he stormed out the house and cursed me out saying that I was not allowed to leave the house as I had originally planned to see a movie with a friend and I was free to starve if I was so unhappy and that he’d not only sell my cat, but kick me out. 

At this point in time I have made myself a small instant noodle soup not that long ago and ate some veggies since he was out of the house taking my siblings to a restaurant to spite me. 

Personally, I don’t mind. My plan is to just withdraw all of the help I do in the house and will stop asking for my father’s. I’m taking the bus to my school and will either make my own meals or starve for the day like he has told me to do. It’s not that difficult since my sensory issues get so bad I sometimes can’t at for a week or more.

My stepmother told me that it isn’t his fault and I should just apologize and call it a day since he has had a struggle with his work. Others tell me I’m overreacting but this is the last time I’m letting this happen.

So, am I the a-hole?"	2	2	1.0

When he was old enough, he became my responsibility. He seems just like everyone else but he needs supervision and it would be very difficult for him to live alone. 

My husband knew this when we started dating. I have told him a billion times my brother will always be my priority. He understood. My husband and brother’s relationship has been decent. My brother doesn’t care for him much and my husband treated him kindly. Like I said, he was quite understanding. 

Things started to change a couple months ago. He’s not mean, but he’s become distant. I asked him if everything was alright and he asked me if my brother would ever move out. I told him the truth, most likely no. Of course we don’t know what the future may hold but my brother still needs me at this moment in time. My husband didn’t push it.

The other day my husband came home with a few of his coworkers. I was given no warning. I tried calling my brother so he wouldn’t be overwhelmed when he came home from his job but his phone was dead. So when he did come home, he was extremely overwhelmed and I had to take him on a walk. My husband called me several times while we were out on this walk but I didn’t answer. Honestly I was a little annoyed but mostly I was busy with my brother. 

We went home eventually and his coworkers had left thankfully. I was just going to let it go but my husband yelled at me for embarrassing him in front of his coworkers. I asked him what he meant by that and he explained that I had a bad attitude with everyone and was very inhospitable. He said I didn’t act like his wife and one of his coworkers made fun of my husband for marrying a poor excuse of a woman. Edit: by this he meant cook for them and entertain them. Keep in mind, had he given me a warning, I would’ve done so with no complaints. But was I supposed to read his mind? 

I told him to snap out of it and he should know better. My husband rolled his eyes and told me that I only have my brother in my head and that he’s just a second thought. He then called my brother the r slur. 

This made me extremely angry so I told him that there’s no use getting mad at me, he married me knowing that he’ll always be second. He called me insufferable before leaving. Now he’s with his mom now and she yelled at me for coddling my brother and neglecting my husband. I’m curious and need to let off steam, AITA?

Edit:

Just in case anyone gets the wrong idea, my husband isn’t involved in my brother’s care, like at all. Not even financially. I wouldn’t put that burden on him. He did go to a few therapy sessions just to understand my brother’s disability but that’s it. "	3147	2710	0.86

I have one sibling, a shell-shocked young woman whose nickname is ""Ash"" (24F). She's been dealing with problems ever since the age of 14, when she got into a relationship with her damned former elementary school teacher, and although she's a successful graduate student who has a bright future in academia, she tells me that she's just ""barely"" clinging on to life. Most pertinent to this post is that Ash really cannot handle being touched by anybody. Not me, not our parents, nobody...Except for my girlfriend, who has developed a very strong bond with my sister.


Last month, Ash's apartment unit caught on fire. Strictly speaking, it was her own negligence that caused the fire, but we all took it easy on her because the fire was small. Nevertheless, when she evacuated the unit, she called me in a panic, and my girlfriend and I raced over to pick her up and let her stay at our apartment for the night. I was heartbroken when Ash refused my hugs, like always, but my sister allowed my girlfriend not only to clean up her dusty hair, but my girlfriend stayed in Ash's room while she was changing into clean clothes. And I have problems with that just by itself because that's creepy and inappropriate, but I mostly have problems with the larger issue of why my sister rejects my physical affection while welcoming that of my girlfriend.


I can't deny that I am angry about this entire situation. And my girlfriend is angry at me because I vented my anger out at her. She tells me that it's not my fault at all that Ash rejects my physical affection....but it's also not my sister's fault that she's uncomfortable with it."	1	11	0.5

We will be using my car.  Driving rather than flying is my sister’s preference, which I have agreed to for toting gifts to/from. I absolutely dread the drive and would 1000% rather fly. 

My sister lives about 30 miles southwest of me. Since we are headed East, I asked what time she’d like to be at my house to head out. To my surprise, she was EXTREMELY off put by the assumption that she would be driving to my house before the long drive, as she thought we mutually agreed that this year, I would pick her up “on the way” out and drop her off “on the way” back into town.  

I feel this approach is illogical as she has to head in the direction of my house (East) anyway, so what she perceives as extra time added to her drive would be occurring in either case. However, if I head West to pick her up, I’m adding an additional 45 minutes each time that I otherwise would not have to make, and I will literally have to pass the exit to my town to drop her off after already traveling 1000 miles. 

She feels this is unfair, and that she is assuming more of the burden by driving to my house due to the extra time and packing/unpacking of the car. I offered to go to her home after work the night before we leave (I work closer to her than I live) and help her pack up the car, have offered that my husband and I do the majority of the long drive, and have even offered to pick her up before we head out if she can arrange to head home from my house when we get back (I have two dogs that I need to get back to).  She says I’m unable to come to a “reasonable” compromise.  I think driving rather than flying in it of itself is a compromise, in addition to other options I presented.

The house consists of my friend, the cheating roommate, and another roommate. We are in college, and the idea is that my friend and the other roommate are not going to allow the other roommate to live with them next quarter. The lease is quarterly. 

My friend told me about this, and how he feels he’s right because he believes cheating is wrong. (Edit: He asked for my thoughts on the whole situation). While I agreed that cheating is wrong, I called him stupid for getting involved in business and drama that doesn’t concern him. I said that this is between his roommate and his girlfriend, and it isn’t his decision to kick this guy out. I also reminded him that all three of them signed a contract, so it isn’t necessarily his decision to make sure this guy is out. He claims that him and the other roommate are “working” something to make sure this guy isn’t living with them next year. (Edit: There are university apartments, so apparently they are both going to go to the university directly. No idea what they are going to say)

Whether this actually happens or not (I doubt), I told him that his intentions are wrong and he shouldn’t be getting involved in business that isn’t his. He then said that I’m implying that what the roommate did is correct and other stuff. I then reminded him that what happens between his roommate and his girlfriend is there business, and it doesn’t make sense either way since him cheating in no way affects the living situation that all three of them have. The conversation just kept going in a loop of him implying that I support the roommates actions, and me telling him that his roommates actions doesn’t affect him and he’s being petty.

Edit: I am making these edits to clarify information and prevent people from making assumptions. I am not here to debate.

Many are saying that I am getting involved in drama. I am not getting involved in this situation at all. My friend asked for my opinion and I gave it, along with laying out the facts for him. I also reminded him that their lease for next quarter is signed, so unless somehow this guy cheating affects their living situation, then they can’t kick him out. I told him his only option is to sign the lease with someone else the quarter after. 

I should also note that supposedly the roommate was cheating the entire quarter. However, my friend said that the living situation was smooth and stayed the same throughout. That’s when I told him his cheating roommate didn’t affect his living situation. 

At the end of the day, I don’t care if my friend and his other roommate get this guy kicked out. It doesn’t concern me. But I was asked for my thoughts on a situation, so I gave it.

Edit 2: People are confused about what I mean when I’m saying the lease is signed for next quarter. The next quarter is from Jan 12th to April 12th. This means that all three of them are going to live together until April 12th. I should note that getting leases for certain apartments in the university is very difficult, and the university rarely kicks anyone out unless someone is doing something very detrimental (Using/selling drugs, vandalizing, etc.)"	1	28	0.45

My mothers side of the family consists of my Mother and her 2 sisters (aunt A & aunt B). Both of my aunts are married and both have a daughter, my direct family is my parents, myself and my sister. the 6 females of that side of the family hang out a lot. Bingo, going out for lunch, trips to the cinema etc.

One of my aunts came up with the idea that the 6 of them were all going to go to Paris for a week for her my mothers upcoming 60th birthday but my dad and I were also to chip in to cover the cost of my mothers. Her birthday being in January and the trip being in April.

The cost breakdown was basically my aunts paying for my mums flights (£125 split between both of their households) with my dad and I paying for the hotel stays and Disneyland tickets (approx. £500).

The idea was put out to book a private suite at a local restaurant and have my dad take her out for dinner to be met with all the family & close friends who got there early as a big surprise. We are getting a cake made for her that we would give her at the end of dinner and we would all present her with the surprise that she's going on holiday to Paris with my aunts and the daughters of the family.

Her birthday falls on a date that I am working late and have no chance of getting time off to see her so I asked if we could move the dinner to the following weekend (2 days) and give her her gift then so that everyone is there and we can all talk about it together.

We all agreed that moving the dinner to the weekend is ok but my aunts are still dead set on giving this gift (which between my dad and I, the two people not actually going, have contributed 2/3rds of the cost of this gift) on her birthday because ""if we don't give her anything on her birthday, she will get suspicious that something is up""

I said to them that I have already bought another gift that I can give her to open on her birthday to throw her off any big surprise, then suggested that they just lie and say to her on her actual birthday that they booked a spa weekend for them all to go on later in the year and we wait till the dinner for the big present surprise when we are all there to see her get it.

This has resulted in a pile on from my aunts and cousins saying that I am being selfish, I have just to tell my mother about Paris alone since that's what I want, no one is going over to have a small party on her birthday and no one is going to dinner anymore.

Am I The Asshole as my aunts are suggesting for wanting to give a group gift to my mother when everyone that contributed to the gift would be there to see her get it? or should I let them gift it to her when they want? "	1	1	1.0

There is a lot more going on in the background than what i am going to share on here due to keeping my friends privacy and anonymity.

So, now to the story, my friends house/animals have fleas. (to no fault of my friend themselves, as i said theres a long back story). Now usually this wouldnt bother me too much aside from doing the necessary actions to prevent carrying any remaining fleas,eggs etc into my house in order to keep my house and animals from also getting fleas (my cat is currently living exclusively in my carpeted bedroom) This has been the case for probably over a year now and it has gone without a hitch. This person is my best friend and i would never want anything to get in the way of us seeing each other. However, i have a very very long history of MH issues (stemming from childhood trauma and yaddah yaddah etc etc) and recently have been noticing myself doing things that are very much indicative of the early stages of an episode. Things like feeling fleas crawling on me and biting me, endlessly searching my carpet for any signs of fleas and just general paranoia, i have set out multiple different types of flea traps in several locations throughout my room and havent caught any. I feel like im losing my mind over this and i feel horrible about maybe having to tell my friend that they cant come to my house/me go to theirs because of the fleas which may or may not even be in my house?? I dont want to offend them by them thinking i dont want to see them because of the fleas because thats not the case at all i dont want them to feel bad about any of this because its not their fault at all. They have their own struggles and i dont want this to hurt them. i absolutely want to see them i just dont want this to turn into a full blown episode because every psychotic episode i have ends in hospitalisation. idk i just feel like im being selfish. i feel like im unnecessarily making my friend feel guilty for a situation they cant control? 

&#x200B;

TLDR;

My friends house has fleas, i have a history of psychotic episodes and think im in the start of one because of feeling fleas on me. Might have to ask friend to not come over/ me not go to their house but feel selfish for saying this as its not their fault."	1	1	1.0

After his first session he realised he needed new boots, he was slipping and sliding all over the place.

He's 6ft5 and has size 12 feet so I (31f) said I would go to a large sports chain store a few miles away to get them as i go to that town weekly for a blood test and it was on the way... I had seen a pair of Adidas ones on sale on their website and shown him a photo of a pair for around £45

It's very important to know that he does not like change, he can't handle plans changing or foods being different, yet he's very impulsive. I'm usually the one that has to go out last minute searching for things because he puts it off to avoid thinking about sudden changes, last time it was him telling me at 8pm the night before a funeral that he doesn't own a shirt (he has issues with buttons and even thinking of wearing the shirt put him in a bad mood) so I had to drive to 4 different stores at 9pm to find a long enough shirt and trousers set. For this reason i have to plan out every single aspect of our week so he knows what's happening and I always buy the same food etc. 

His shoes are ALL Adidas.  I tried really hard to get the Adidas ones I'd seen but they didn't have any in his size. I looked at others that were the same brand and his size but the cheapest pair were £100 (way out of budget) 
I spent 20 minutes talking to the guy who worked there and he was very knowledgeable, he suggested boots in our price range that had the studs needed, the right shape etc. However they were a different brand. They were £10 less than we had budgeted too.

I walk in the door and explained that I'd tried really hard and spent a long time trying to find a pair in his size and budget but they weren't Adidas, same colour and shape but not that brand. 

He then berates me for changing the brand without consulting him and asking why I can't just think about things before doing them, telling me I should have called him to ask as he would have told me not to bother, ""why bother showing me a photo if you werent getting them anyway!"" Etc . 
I got cross because I'd worked hard to find them and told him I'm sick of him never appreciating the fact I spent time out of my day to help him and he was rude to me, if he'd have said ""I appreciate the effort you made but I'd much rather they were Adidas, I'll just take them back and exchange them for ones I'd like"" I would be disappointed but understanding.

 Now he's being childish, I asked him to get some drain unblocker on his way home and told him which one I need and his response was ""so instead of the one you want I'll just get you the store brand instead, since you think that's alright"" 

I told him ""go screw yourself, I'm done helping you out. If you can't do these things yourself then I won't be held responsible""

I have nothing against him - he seems fine - but I want to hang with her not them. I’ve been trying to ignore it and just let him come because I didn’t want to be an asshole but yesterday I decided to ask if our hangout tomorrow could just be us. She never responded. AITA?	1	1	1.0

I am definitely more extroverted than him and I’m not afraid to try new things. He is the complete opposite. So far I’ve taken advantage of many opportunities to find what I want to do in life such as being a lab assistant, being a teaching assistant, a mentor, a resource assistant, and others but the most recent one is becoming a board member for a nonprofit. I have been pestering him to join because so far, other than school and work (avg 6 hrs per week, I work about 20), he’s done nothing else to figure out what he wants to do in life. He says that he’d like to try a lab position but he’s not actively looking for anything, he applied once to the program I was in and the spots had already been filled , but it’s offered every semester and he just stoped trying even after I sent him the application multiple times. I even had his mother tell him to take advantage and have him apply but he did not retry. We tried working on his resume but never really finished it. He is very smart and capable yet he doesn’t have any initiative and I end up feeling like I am pestering him and to an extent mothering him. Would I be the asshole for making him join, even if he doesn’t want to? We have gone volunteering together and I saw him smile genuinely, he just doesn’t want to join??? How do I help him get out of that bare minimum mindset? I don’t want him to be a highly educated warehouse worker for the rest of his life	1	29	0.5

Her sister recently told her that she was getting married. However she is having the wedding back in their home country of Lebanon. We currently all live in Canada. At the time the sister is getting married next year our baby will be about 8 months old.

We already have money issues and I would struggle to get time off, so my wife suggested she go to Lebanon alone for 2 weeks. Personally I was kind of shocked she even suggested it. The baby would still be breast feeding at that time. If it was only a couple of days I could manage with pre-pumped milk. Or if the baby was a couple of years old and eating solid food I could manage. But it seemed way too young to leave for that length of time.

I told her she couldn't leave such a young baby for so long. But she said it's her sister's wedding and she should be there. I said it's the sister's own fault for choosing to have it in Lebanon.

My wife has now been giving me the silent treatment since I said it. AITA?

EDIT:

A common question is why she wouldn't take the baby with her. The main issue is that Lebanon wasn't the safest country in the world to begin with, and now they're getting involved in the war with Israel. I think perhaps she also wanted to enjoy the wedding without having to lug a baby around."	1306	853	0.86
