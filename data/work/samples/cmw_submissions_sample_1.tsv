I just don't understand all the hate for her. I don't think she is the funniest of all time, or even in the top 100, but she does make me laugh more often than not.

I think her show is pretty good also. I think the last fuckable day sketch was fantastic. I know she had very little to do in that sketch, but I also want to make that point. She got a show on the air, hired a good team, and they crank out some pretty good shit.

I know she has writers. The VAST majority of comedians have writers, or at the very least but jokes on occasion. Richard Prior had writers, and collaborators.

I also thought Trainwreck was terrible. As a film lover, i put most of that on terrible direction(Sorry Judd).

The last joke everyone is talking about at the Emmy's was both poorly written and performed. I don't expect anyone to bat a 1000. Especially if your in the business putting yourself out there and making people laugh.

This isn't a question of weather or not she has stolen jokes. My guess is the on some level she has. If it's a writer stealing it, or her. However, not all of her material is stolen. Some of it is unique, and funny.

edit: I haven't changed my view that she's funny but...

1. Humor is subjective and it was a poor choice for a topic. I should have said something more along the lines that I feel she gets an unbalanced level of vitriol.

2. I have forgotten about being in the Reddit cloud. I love this group, but it is defiantly the key demographic of people that dislike her. Since Reddit is the only social media I engage, and the only one a visit on a very regular basis, my perspective is skewed.

3. Finally, here's my CMV. I do understand the other side better now. I still believe it is unbalanced, but I understand. As a huge fan of stand up, I was very angry watching all the success and attention that came with the ""Redneck Comedy Tour"". I couldn't fathom why they were getting so much attention. I believed that their comedy was actually hurting the art of comedy, and dumbing down their audience, instead of challenging them to become a more sophisticated audience. I like to see comedy move forward and push the boundaries, and I believed their efforts were killing that.

I can definitely see why people would have an unbalanced level of vitriol, because she's getting an unbalanced level of attention and success. However, I still believe the level to which this goes is unwarranted, and unnecessary. Capitalism usually sorts these things out. But... Adam Sandler keeps making terrible movies, so that's not always true.
 
Thanks Reddit, and a special thanks to Grunt08. I'm out! (mic drop)

We all make snap judgments about the people we meet, like it or not, and that affects how we interact with them and think of them. All i do is embrace that and become conscious of it. To use the book analogy, in the bookshop, the cover is worn, tatty, has fowl language all over it and no redeeming qualities as far as i can see. I would not pick up that book. Yes, maybe there is a good story inside, and maybe i would enjoy it if i tried, but why?
Why invest my time and effort in something that the author (the person in question) didn't deem fit for a good cover (outside appearance and initial interaction)? Am i supposed to read through a book before i buy it? every book? no. Same with people, if they don't seem like my kind of person on the outset, i will not peruse a relationship with them and depending on the situation, actively avoid that.
The likelyhood that the tatty book with the bad cover being the worst choice is far greater than the well presented cover.
I like to surround myself with people that increase my quality of life in the same way i would expect to do for them. I'm proud of the company i keep, even though it means i don't engage with a lot of the population
The amount i hear people going on about not judging a book by its cover and that people deserve second chances etc, i'm worried that i'm just becoming the classic snob and am missing out on whatever the other people might bring to the table. Am i doing the right thing? CMV"	13	35

I want the electoral college to remain in place to safeguard against tyranny, however, I think it should be reformed so that the winner of the popular vote during a routine election isn't robbed of their victory.

An individual may say, ""well, you're not giving the small states a voice if you reform the electoral college to reflect the will of the majority, and you're leaving the election to be decided by New York, Illinois, and California.""

My response to this would be a few things.

First, let's look at 2016; if we look at only California, New York, and Illinois, around 16 million votes for Clinton came from those states. That means a quarter of the votes for her came from those states, which also means 75% of the votes for her came from other states. That's a far cry from NY, IL, and CA having all of the power in an election.

Second, in those 3 states, there were also collectively around 10 million votes for Trump. In this kind of situation, I don't find it fair that all of the conservative votes get cancelled out just because the majority of the people in those states voted blue.

Third, both conservative and liberal states, despite the outcome of a national election, still have their values protected by their voice in Congress, their voice in state government, and their voice in local government. 

I believe every vote should be equal. Keep the Electoral College, but reform it, is my view. How would we do this? I think there's a number of ways, but that's a different discussion for another time."	1	113

Had a few thoughts about how there is little logic in the idea that increased gun control legislation would fix the issues. 

Most of these people had no legal history that would prevent them from not owning a gun. Of the 14, 2 had a drug offense (misdemeanor possession and paraphernalia), 2 had domestic violence charges (2002 and 2006 respectively). One of each SHOULD have disqualified them from purchasing a firearm, but the departments in charge of those cases failed to report the charges to the databases used to conduct background checks. One had a charge from kicking a hole in the wall at a bar and the other had several settled small charges since the 90's (undisclosed, so this one is useless to analyze, if anyone can find out i'd like to know). None of these past events of these people can be reasonably used to develop a background check system that WORKS. 

Then from the mental health angle, many of these people had done nothing at all other than being a loner, possibly dealing with issues that were half treated but became clear warning signs AFTER they did unspeakable things. 

Someone please point me to a logical argument and change my view.

According to these statements, the genitalia or other biological aspects of ourselves do not define our gender. However, the societal and individual role of a person is subjective and is always changing (as a lot of members of the LGBT community are striving to do right now). So then, what does it mean to be a woman or a man? The sense of these terms is lost if defined by a set of subjective rules. CMV.

Edit: I've read a lot of comments asking me where the logical fallacy lies, and maybe I didn't use the correct term but I want to clarify the meaning of that statement.

Suppose there is a male person, but that male person *feels* like a woman. That automatically makes her gender to be that of a woman, even though it is not based on any objective point of view. The premise that gender can be whatever one wants makes the meaning of that term irrelevant, since no one can objectively confirm nor deny that statement, given that the ""rules"" for being a woman can change and be different from one person to another. If this isn't true, why are the terms man and women used to describe sex *and* also gender? Where do these terms come from, if not from our biology and physiology?"	1	74	
changemyview	t3_2ejmqy	https://www.reddit.com//r/changemyview/comments/2ejmqy/cmv_americas_attitude_towards_sugary_softdrinks/	2014-08-25 17:12:57	FaerieStories	CMV: America's attitude towards sugary soft-drinks is alarming	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2ejmqy/cmv_americas_attitude_towards_sugary_softdrinks/	"Firstly: yes, I'm aware ""America's attitude"" is a rather nebulous term. America is not a homogeneous entity with a single attitude. I'm essentially referring to a generalised impression of the country's stance on this matter as reflected in the practice of the establishments which sell these drinks.

----------

I'm an English person, and I'm just back from a month-long holiday in America (mostly California, but also Arizona, Nevada and briefly Illinois). One glaring cultural difference between the UK and the US I've noticed has been the attitudes to beverages. The US is quite strict on its alcohol - which is less easy to purchase than in the UK for various reasons (less bars, more expensive, higher drinking age - etc), plus I would add that the vast majority of ales and lagers are utterly terrible, but I digress. Anyway - point is - America's attitude towards alcohol is rather good. It treats it like the dangerous drug it is.

But America's attitude to soft drinks is absolutely shocking. You can barely walk down a street in America without Coca-Cola entering your throat. The entire country seems designed to make every single citizen consume as much Coke, Dr. Pepper, Fanta, Sprite (etc...) as humanly possible. Every restaurant, corner store, bar, cafe, hotel etc seems to have ""making a profit"" as their secondary aim. Their primary agenda is for their patrons to consume as much sugary liquid as they can possibly make them before they keel over in diabetic agony.

I feel I'm getting carried away again. Ok, to bring this more to the point, here are the things which seem to suggest to me that the US don't seem to realise how unhealthy soft-drinks are:

------------

* Regular bottles of coke/mountain jew/spit/sergeant pepper or whatever are significantly larger than their UK counterparts.
* In the UK, 'unlimited soft drinks' is a novelty concept used only by select few chains, such as pizza hut. In the US it is the overwhelming norm. Every single fast-food outlet, cafe or restaurant comes with a 'fountain' which you can top up at any time. You are essentially encouraged not only to keep refilling your drink, but even take one 'for the road'. Unless you have incredible self-restraint, a visit to one of these places (in conjunction with salty fast-food) often leads to drinking far more than you probably would have, had the saccharine liquid not been so freely available.
* Why you'd even want to refill your drink baffles me, because the sizes are absolutely terrifying. A 'small' cup at McDonalds, Subway, Burger King etc is generally the size of a UK 'medium'. A 'medium' is bigger than a UK large. And a 'large' is a monstrous bucket the size of a small dog. If anyone actually finishes an entire large from Burger King in one sitting they should sit down and take a long hard think about their life choices.


-------

Anyway - point is I find all this rather indicative that the US doesn't seem to think sugary soft drinks like coke are very harmful to one's health. Or if they do realise that, they are making too much of a profit on them to restrict them in the sort of way they restrict alcohol consumption. I saw a fair few leviathanic morbidly obese waddlers during my time in 'Merica, and I can't help but think that adopting a similar attitude to the UK where sugary drinks are concerned would go a long way to thinning out their ranks (pun intended).  

P.S. - I am no medical expert, and so I suppose one way in which my view could be changed is by changing my current view that sugary soft drinks are rather bad for your health.

Let's go through the actions of Cersei and see if the sum of her actions and personality can be characterized as evil. 

# Season 1

**Potentially influencing Jaime to push Bran out of the tower.**

* It is difficult to know whether she truly wanted Jaime to push Bran as she didn't say so explicitly. But lets even assume she did want that, while the action is undoubtedly gruesome is it truly evil? If she wanted to push Bran it is not out of some ill intent towards him but because of self preservation for her and more importantly her children, she knows that if Bran spreads her secret not only will she be killed, but all of her children will be butchered by Robert. Any mother in the same situation would have made the same choice. This does not make her evil. This is going to become a theme btw, Cersei does make gruesome but necessary decisions when forced into a corner with no way out. 

**Showing sympathy to Catlyn**

* Number two is a good deed. After Bran falls she shows sympathy to Catlyn and tells her about losing her first child. Small deed but this is absolutely important for her character.

**Killing Sansa's wolf (lady).**

* This undoubtedly looks like a cruel act, but if we remove our bias for cute dogs is it really?. Remember that she does it to correct the humility Joffrey suffered from being beaten by a girl and bitten by a wolf. And she doesn’t know whether Arya and the Wolf ambushed Joffrey or if Joffrey started the fight (which he did), as she wasn’t there. This reasonable justification is something I think differentiates her from the truly evil characters like Joffrey and Ramsay, they don’t need a justification for their actions. They are cruel for the sake of being cruel. And other characters like Tywin who I also consider evil, have extremely flimsy excuses for their evil deeds, (Tywin is unnecessarily cruel to Tyrion for his mothers death in childbirth, something he has no responsibility for. Tywin is intelligent and knows this deep down but still continues his cruelty which is why he is evil).

**Having Robert killed.**

* If a friend you knew got physically abused, verbally abused, sexually abused, ignored and mocked for years would you think it was evil to kill the abuser? THE ANSWER IS NO, and that happened to Cersei. And furthermore, she only has Robert killed once she is forced into a corner where her children will be killed or hunted down for the rest of her life if she doesn’t as Ned is about to tell him her secret. 100% justified.

**Being partly responsible for having Ned Stark's men killed in the Throne room.** 

* Once again a fully justified action and it doesn’t just lie on her shoulders, Littlefinger and Janos Slynt also have responsibility. Ned Stark is threatening to strip her and her children of all power, imprison them and to leave them at the mercy of Stannis Baratheon who would kill them all. Cersei gives Ned ample opportunity to swear loyalty to Joffrey and return to Winterfell, unharmed with all his men and both his daughters. This is an extremely generous offer considering he has already said he knows her secret. He rejects this and forces her hand; Ned Stark is fully to blame for getting his men killed.

**Trying to get Ned Stark to join the night's watch**

* This is a good deed, she is trying to avoid war and giving Ned the opportunity to stay at the watch instead of rotting in a cell for the rest of his life. Once again, extremely generous.

**Cersei tries to stop Joffrey from having Ned stark killed**

* Cersei does try to get Joffrey to stop the execution of Ned stark. Some ridiculously argue that she didn’t try hard enough. ZERO of the powerful people (Varys, Pycelle, etc) around Joffrey at the time manage to make him change his mind. This is a good deed as she is trying to avoid war once again.

# Season 2

* Now we have come to season 2. And in this season Cersei doesn’t do a single act that is even questionable. And no, being rude to Tyrion once after he joked about her incest isn’t evil. That’s verbal payback for being mocked. The same goes for being angry at him for basically kidnapping Myrcella. And while she imprisons Rose (because she believes Tyrion cares about her), she only does this to make sure Tyrion doesn’t hurt Joffrey, she immediately lets her go once Blackwater is finished and doesn’t torture her. So let's move on to good deeds.

**Good deeds.**

* She gives Catlyn Ned Stark's bones back. Yes Tyrion suggests it, but she allows it (Which she has no reason to do if she is truly evil).
* She gives Sansa advice and once again shows sympathy to her after her period. 
* She recommends she has a child, so she gets some happiness in her life. Literally no other reason to suggest this other than being kind (and no she doesn’t care about Lannister legacy like Tywin does). 
* She is clearly disturbed by Joffrey torturing prostitutes and being cruel to Sansa. Literally questioning whether Joffreys cruelness is a price for her incest. One of the most humane moments in the show.
* She first lies to Sansa about Ser Ilyn being in Maegor's Holdfast to protect them as she doesn’t want Sansa to be scared. Only when she gets more drunk does she admit the truth (which obviously isn’t evil either).
* She is about to kill Tommen when she thinks the battle is lost to spare him from the pain of Stannis killing her and him. 

Note: As you see, plenty of good deeds

# Season 3.

**Cersei being Jealous of Margery**

* Yes Cersei is Jealous of Margaery, but she doesn’t say or do anything that is out of line before Margaery literally tries to manipulate her during Sansa's wedding with the whole “let's be sisters”, Cersei realizes this and turns hostile as anybody would if they know they are being knowingly manipulated.

**Cersei recommends Tyrion give Sansa a Child**

* Once again, a really good deed. No, she is not doing it to impress Tywin, it is made explicitly clear that she doesn’t care about his legacy in season 4. She does it because she wants Sansa to have some happiness in her life, an extremely good deed.

**Cersei tries to stop Joffrey from verbally abusing Sansa at her wedding**

* Another sign that she isn't evil is that she doesn’t like the unnecessary cruelty of Joffrey and tries to stop him several times. For example: Cersei is disturbed by Joffrey's insistence of serving Rob Stark's head to Sansa and even tries to insist it was a joke to give Joffrey the opportunity to abandon his cruelty. When he insists she looks even more disturbed

# Season 4

* In this Season Cersei is a bit more questionable but nothing that rises to the level of “evil”.

**Cersei wants Pycelle to feed the leftovers of Joffrey's weddings to the dogs.**

\- This is just done out of Jealousy, while it is certainly childish it isn’t evil.

**Cersei wants to kill Tyrion**

* She truly believes he killed Joffrey, she is obviously wrong, but no parent is evil in my view for wanting their child’s killer dead. 

**Cersei tells Tywin the truth about her incest.**

* This is a morally gray deed. Though I would say it's mainly done out of love, she thinks he wants to steal and manipulate her son (which he basically does want) and therefore tries to stop him.

# Season 5 

* Season 5 is more of the same.

**Cersei imprisons Loras and is partly responsible for Margaery's imprisonment**

* Here Margery only has herself to blame, she mocks Cersei in front of an audience of girls. Insulting her drinking habbits, telling her about having sex with her son, rubbing in the fact that Cersei is no longer queen. And no this hostility isn’t just Cersei’s fault, Margaery started the hostility by attempting to manipulate her. And while it is once again childish of Cersei to imprison Loras, that’s really all it is. She just wanted some short term schadenfreude. She had no idea how powerful the faith militant would become and did not intend to start a war with the Tyrells. She is clearly ignorant in this situation, not evil.

**Cersei rubs it in Margaery's face that she is in prison**

\- Margaery did the same to her, enough said.

# Season 6

**Cersei kills a guy who flashes her in the lowest moment of her life.** 

* This guy literally sexually harasses her, and then continues to brag about it. She is the victim, not him. Not evil.

**Cersei blows up the sept.**

* I am guessing this is a moment some might believe, ""aha gotcha"". But no. Cersei tries every other option before resorting to this extreme. She tries to stay in the red keep and put it all behind her, that’s not enough for the faith as they demand she is put on trial, she tries to solve that by having a trial by combat, the high sparrow then manipulates Tommen into absolving Trial by combat and sends Jaime away so he won't be there to protect her.
* When she has no other way out, her life is on the line. The city is ruled by religious fanatics who brutalize anybody who dissent; she finally blows up the sept. She even saves her son who betrayed her. Also, if not for the faith militants' stupidity Margaery and Loras might even have survived and another war could have been avoided. The absolute majority of the blame here is on the faith militant and the high sparrow who gave her no choice.

**Cersei kills Pycelle**

* Pycelle is a disgusting man responsible for allowing Tywin Lannister to sack kings landing, he betrayed Tyrion, He betrayed Jon Aryn, he likes very young girls (though I am not saying he is interested in children), he manipulates Tommen and he stares at Cersei with a sexual smirk after she does her walk of atonement. Though killing him is kinda cruel he is clearly a man who would betray her the first chance he got and also a HORRIBLE person. This act is sorta cruel, I admit that. But one cruel act does not make one evil, especially considering the MANY good deeds she does.

# Season 7

**Cersei ruling as queen**

* She mainly just rules as a typical monarch trying to defend her kingdom, defending yourself against an illegitimate and whiny invader like Daenerys is not evil in the slightest. Yes, she does kill the Sand snake (don’t remember her name) and the wife of Oberyn in a rather cruel way, however they literally killed her daughter just to start a war. Totally justified from Cersei. 

**Cersei allows Olenna Tyrell a peaceful and painless death**

* Some of you might argue that since she even considered a cruel death for her enemy, she is evil. Absolutely not, it is precisely the fact that she is able to reconsider which makes her different from evil people like Joffrey who don’t. 

**Cersei allows Jaime Lannister to leave her unharmed, even though he is betraying her by fighting with her enemies.**

* Once again, an extremely generous act considering what he is doing. Betraying her to fight for another house. And no it was absolutely justified by Cersei to not honor her pledge to fight against the white walkers. Daenerys (the spoiled brat) literally says she will invade her afterwards despite the help.

# Season 8

* Season 8 doesn’t count, and she spends her time staring out of windows and complaining about elephants. Season 8 sucks

# Conclusion

* In conclusion, while Cersei is certainly not good, and is perhaps one of the most flawed characters on the show she is still not evil. She doesn’t enjoy cruelty to people who haven’t harmed her severely (like killing her child), she can often give good advice and show sympathy, she often tries to stop her son from being cruel, etc. But I want you guys to come with counter arguments and tell me why I should change my view, I am willing to listen :)"	0	151	0.44

I call it the ""Dawkin's Paradox"". Named after Richard Dawkins who, though very intelligent and historically correct on most points, presents himself in a way that makes him out to be a total asshole. Most people who disagree with him don't disagree with his viewpoints but seek to actively disagree with him. The Dawkin's Paradox is when you're completely and unequivocally correct but there is a disagreement based on you presenting yourself like a total prat.

I first noticed this when I was younger and got into arguments with my brother. I, being younger, found myself being wrong pretty often and it would just irritate me to no end when my brother would mock my point of view and disqualify me as ""stupid"". After hours of arguing I'd understand that I was wrong but would still be blue-faced trying to scream about what I was right about, even if that wasn't even the initial argument.

As I got older, I noticed myself doing the same thing to others: Disavowing their point of view, calling them stupid, and poisoning the well for others. What I noticed shortly after that is the people I did that to would take up contrarian positions simply to defy me. Sometimes it would be trolling, but sometimes they'd be stuck in the same petulant conundrum I was in when I argued with my brother: I just didn't want him to be right.

After a few failed interactions where I did nothing but reinforce my opponents viewpoint I decided to try a ""same team"" mentality whereupon we both were discovering new things and their viewpoint was simply a starting point which I could use to lead them to the right place. In many situations this worked wonderfully; I was able to get people to understand my point of view and accept the facts that I presented them.

But then the wrench got put in the works. Since it worked so well with things before I tried to pull the same thing with some people who believed ideas I found flat out appalling. I've argued with flat-earthers, intelligent designers, pizzagaters, chemical conspiracy theorists, and a variety of other particularly ludicrous ideas. All of these conversations didn't end well and despite my attempts to be even gratuitously pleasant and understanding I was called everything from ""brainwashed"" to a ""government shill"" to just a plain ""idiot"". Despite these people being painfully ignorant they stood their ground and tried to instead convince me I was wrong.

Each time I went down the rabbit hole with them, trying to use their own logic against them and pointing out things that just flat out are hard to believe. Each time they rebutted my points with either canned statements or an appeal to the unknown. 

After all these conversations I kept saying to myself, ""You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink."" Then in an effort to try to not be completely defeatist at a time when the ability to change a radicalized opinion is important, I'm offering, please, CMV.

One sex must be superior to the other because the sexes have differences that lead to their lives being inarguably better than the other sex because of it. For example, women live longer on average than men which is clearly in favor of women, but men are stronger on average than women, which is clearly in favor of men. While these may cancel out, I find it highly unlikely that after going through every difference, men and women would somehow come to the exact same ""score"".

I don't want this to become a debate about the semantics of the words superior or better because some traits are clearly better than others. Also, this post only applies to humans.

Edit: For the sake of this debate, ""better"" and ""superior"" traits are ones that on average lead to a person having a (insert all positive adjectives here) life.

Edit 2: Again about saying what better is - Pretend if you could choose a sex at birth, we're trying to figure out which one you should choose to have the most fulfilled and happiest life.

My answer to this hypothetical question is this is a harmless action and shouldn't be criminal.	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ep1w2v/cmv_what_if_a_person_that_cant_find_any_rags_in/	"**TL;DR:** *I’m looking for serious answers only. As such, please refrain from answering.*

I’m a gifted individual that is a fierce intellectual and an academic in heart.  I think that this is a harmless action as noted.  I’ll further explain why that I think as such.

I was reading an article this morning and it raised many questions on my part.  In my opinion, this thought-evoking hypothetical question adamantly sheds light upon the partisan divide that we’re currently experiencing in America and across the pond.  As such, I ask this hypothetical question to reddit.  Please think about it carefully.  Furthermore, I am requesting that only serious answers be submitted, of which that are well thought out

In full disclosure, my propositions are considered to be left-libertarian in nature and suggests that I subscribe to humanism and geolibertarianism (I haven't formally declared as to be following such).

Hypothetically, Conservatives would typically view this action in disgust and some may make the proposition that an action such as this shall be criminal.  Liberals would typically view this action as harmless as empirical evidence convinces them to adopt this proposition.  Empirical evidence being that; no one, the country itself or anything really but this person’s flag of which is wholly owned by the person themselves was physically harmed in the process (barring that the person cutting the flag doesn’t cut themselves obviously).  Why should such an action where no person or property other than the person’s flag itself evoke such negative emotions on the hypothetical Conservative part?  This is the question that is raised in my mind that I must ask to Conservatives in reaction to the hypothetical Conservative’s reaction.

The hypothetical Conservative’s typical reaction to this action further raises another question in my mind.  I must ask Conservatives, what gives them the moral high ground with the proposition being that this is wrong when stated empirical evidence adamantly suggests that this would be on the side of Liberals?  What makes such an action so reprehensible and perhaps, criminal?

For Liberals that would actually agree with the hypothetical Conservative, please explain why.  Additionally for Conservatives; if so, why would you disagree with the hypothetical Conservative?

Again, serious answers only as I’m trying to understand everyone’s point of view and reactions.  I can’t speak for all Liberals; but myself, I operate on facts and peer reviewed research and not emotion when it comes to serious matters.  In stating such; I feel that making serious decisions, such as in politics and government shall be based upon rationality and not moral clarity on the part of everyone.

My goal for asking this hypothetical question is Conservatives reflecting on why I and other Liberals feel that this action is harmless and don't subscribed to just simple moral clarity.  Furthermore, I’m hoping that myself and other Liberals can walk away with a better understanding of Conservatives points of view.

Thanks for reading!  I apologize in advance for the long read and the over-the-top formalities."	0	102

My point assumes that this is not an important point in the argument.

I believe that whether or not the protestors have a right to protest, their use of violence (kite bombs for example), and their attempts to breach the Israeli border justify the use of force against them.

What else should Israeli forces do? Allow them to enter?  I am thoroughly confused by some media outlets reporting these incidents as though Israeli is using force without justification or provocation.  If my understanding is incorrect, please by all means CMV."	10	37

I think this is wrong, as the free market means that high earners tend to be people whose work is very beneficial to society and, furthermore, it makes people less likely to aspire to high earning careers. I think instead, jobs should be separated into different bands of usefulness, and the more useful someone's band is to society, the lower the percentage of their income we should take from them.

Here are the bands, from best to worst:

1) **The Advancers: people whose work pushes back the barriers on human progress.** Examples include engineers, scientists, doctors, programmers and software engineers.

2) **The Thinkers: people whose work, if not advancing humanity, adds to the enjoyment and meaning of life.** Examples include good musicians, directors and authors.

3) **The Enforcers: people who, while not improving it, keep society running.** Examples include policemen, firemen, soldiers, lawyers and garbagemen.

4) **The Passive Benefactors: people who don't contribute to societal improvement, but don't harm it either, and work regular jobs.** Examples include waiters, baristas, retail employees and sports pros.

5) **The Destroyers: people whose work harms society.** Examples include certain religious preachers, gangster rappers and reality show celebrities.

Cave to GOP demands on Obamacare or 2. Lose the fight and see the far-reaching consequences to the US and Global Economy	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1nwmq6/cmv_president_obama_and_the_senate_democratic/	"It's a very ingenious strategy. Libertarian and Conservative GOP members are leveraging an advantage provided to them by the Government's previous failings in dealing with three major issues:

1.  The Debt Ceiling - More importantly, this is an issue which causes great consternation within the Libertarian/Small-Gov't Conservatives in the GOP.  The Debt situation in the US was already a major political issue, where even Democrats seemed worried (hence their reasoning behind wishing the repeal of the Bush Tax Cuts).  The US was already in the red from the 2001 economic downturn, coupled with increased spending on conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq.  Many believe this is unsustainable, and with the stimulus following 2008, has only gotten worse.  While I don't believe everyone wants a ""0-debt"" situation, many folks in the GOP want cuts to be made where they can be made and efforts to reduce unnecessary debt. 

2.  Obamacare - This is a fight which started in 2008 and ending in 2010.  It was a vastly controversial topic in American politics.  The GOP was vehemently against it, and many ""Blue-Dog"" Democrats would suffer from supporting it in the 2010 midterm elections.  Love it or hate it, it was a law which one can say was railroaded through Congress by a party which held a decisive majority.  The law also has a lot of major issues that still have yet to be hashed out, mainly the background of how it hopes to be affordable in the long run.

3.  The Budget Process - The US has operated using Continuing Resolutions before, but the lack of proper budget debates or even the passage of a budget is becoming troublesome.  While this issue is tied to the issue of the debt-ceiling, it is also somewhat separate as it's intent is to ensure the proper and efficient stewardship of taxpayer dollars.

All in all, if I can make an analogy here: The battle for Obamacare is the political equivalent of World War I... today's fight over the budget/debt-ceiling/Obamacare is merely the 2nd Act (WWII).  All the loose ends from that time are coming to a head, and the GOP is effectively holding all the cards.  

In fact, their game plan is simple: **Do nothing, while appearing to do something**.  The GOP has already passed a CR which has some changes to Obamacare... primarily to defund it (a backdoor way to eliminating it).

For the GOP, this is a low-risk approach:

1.  Many members of the House were elected in the 2010 Midterms on the promise that they will repeal or remove Obamacare.  This is the faction currently holding out.

2.  Moderate GOPers are already in a tenuous position.  In a time where the GOP is sliding to more Libertarian and Small Government spectrum, these moderates are losing their comparative advantage to similarly moderate Democrats.  They must adapt or die.  John Boehner is a good example of this.

3.  To build on points 1 and 2, the GOP is having a ""changing of the guard"".  The Establishment GOP lost to Presidential Elections with establishment candidates.  It's becoming apparent that the comparative advantage is lose to the Democrats, and the GOP needs to differentiate itself.  It appears that it will not be a party focused on being Small Government and Libertarian (with twinges of social conservativeness). 

4.  President Obama and the Senate Democrats have no other options, but to comply with the demands of the House GOPers.  This is a fact of life.  The longer this shutdown fight continues, the worse things get.  The Democrats look intransigent and are left with only two options: **Give in, or see dire fiscal and economic consequences play out to the US and Global Economies**.

Point #4 is incredibly important, because in a game of chicken between Big Government Democrats and Small Government/Libertarian Republicans, the Republicans will be happy to see dysfunction and chaos which will break the Big Government.  

That is, unless the GOP does something stupid and caves.  Which is also a possibility.  But at this moment, the debt ceiling fight is theirs to lose."	12	144

First, that we ought to maximize the interests of the many over the few. Second, that we ought to consider the opinions of all people. 

As such democracy is the most defensible form of government over all others. 

Moreover democracy is the best system to determine the implementation of all other political systems, including meritocracy, capitalism, socialism, libertarianism, authoritarianism, etc etc. Private property? Sure, under the informed consent of democracy. Socialism? Sure, under the informed consent of democracy. Corporations and capitalism? Sure, under the informed consent of democracy. Let AI run the world? Sure, under the informed consent, and ultimate authority of, democracy. 

It is therefore in our interests to promote [*true democracy* however we can, as defined as](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_A._Dahl#Democracy_and_polyarchies): 

1. Effective participation - 
Citizens must have adequate and equal opportunities to form their preference and place questions on the public agenda and express reasons for one outcome over the other.
2. Voting equality at the decisive stage - 
Each citizen must be assured his or her judgments will be counted as equal in weights to the judgments of others.
3. Enlightened understanding - 
Citizens must enjoy ample and equal opportunities for discovering and affirming what choice would best serve their interests.
4. Control of the agenda - 
Demos or people must have the opportunity to decide what political matters actually are and what should be brought up for deliberation.
5. Inclusiveness - 
Equality must extend to all citizens within the state. Everyone has legitimate stake within the political process."	162	205

I am a white guy with an Asian girlfriend. Mind you I have had 8 serious girlfriends and she is the first Asian girlfriend I have ever had. Of the previous ones, actually 4 of them were white (the other three Latina).


Since I have started bringing her out with me to more social outings, I have from time to time had people insinuate to me that I have some sort of preference for Asian girls or that I am dating her because of her race. It has been really getting on my nerves and I am sick of it. Why can't people see that I am in love with her for who she is? For example, we share a lot of mutual interests, such as climbing, hiking, and other outdoor activities.


Since most of the people who I have heard talk about white guys having ""yellow fever"" are white girls, it has lead me to believe that there is some kind of jealousy factor involved here. I think maybe that since our society (I live in America) is biased towards white people, it has subconsciously ingrained the idea into white people that they are at the ""top of the chain"". Although interracial dating is more accepted in today's society, I think our country's history of racism has caused some white women to be frustrated when they see white men with non-white women (perhaps similar to how some white men get angry when white women choose to date black or latino men).


Now, I realize that there are some white men out there who do fetishize Asian women, perhaps assuming that they are all submissive. I think this is wrong of them and pathetic, I do not condone their behavior. I also did not choose to date my girlfriend because I assumed she would be ""submissive"" (in fact, anyone who knows her could confirm she is the complete opposite of that). But from my experience, these men represent a very small percentage of the male population.


Then there's the whole idea that white men who date Asian women do so because they got rejected by white women. Now first of all, I consider myself to be a decently good looking guy, and given that I have dated white women before, I don't see how this could apply to me. Second, isn't this notion pretty racist in and of itself? After all, it seems imply that Asian women are ""easier"" and thus ""lower value"" than white women.


Finally, what if there are some Asian women that like white guys? Do they then have mayo fever?


Alright, done with my rant. Just sick and tired of people assuming false things about why I am dating my girlfriend.


**Disclaimer**: I do not mean to suggest that all white women are jealous of white men who are dating Asian or non-white girls or that all white women are mad that they aren't held up on as high of pedestal as they used to be by society. This only the vibe I get from SOME white women.

changemyview	t3_1ksawh	https://www.reddit.com//r/changemyview/comments/1ksawh/i_think_the_entertainment_industry_is_corrupt/	2013-08-21 04:56:04	velvety_stew	I think the entertainment industry is corrupt, everyone is fake, greedy and all the women were forced to sleep their way to the top. CMV	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ksawh/i_think_the_entertainment_industry_is_corrupt/	"Music: People only become famous because they're pretty and have the capacity to learn songs. Rarely do any of them posses any actual talent. In my view, only a handful of people write their own songs. A few more than that are experts with whatever instrument they play, and a few more than that can actually sing, but they're like diamonds in a sea of talentless pretty people. I want you to prove to me that the talentless scabs are just a minority, albeit the loudest and ""popular"" minority.

Movies: Everyone is greedy. Movies aren't made to influence social change but instead are made to profit off of social unrest. (For example the most recent Batman movie had Occupy movement undertones.) Typecasting only exists because actors are like one trick ponies. No one thinks the America populace has the attention span or intelligence to sit through a movie with an actual plot.

Entertainment industry in general: Most everyone is it in for the money. Most everyone is shallow and self-absorbed and unable to understand the common, middle-class American. Almost no one is famous for talent alone, because sex appeal is a must. Women are forced to sleep their way up the ladder in a perverse, male controlled industry.

Final note: You can't deny that none of this exists. I just feel like it is all I see. I want proof that this is in the minority of what's really going on and it's just all that's in the media so that's all I know. My only argument for anything you may post in reply to this is **prove it**. I don't like this belief, and I would love if you could change it, but I need proof."	11	21

Most recently, I was watching the episode of ""The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore"" (really really excellent for only being a few weeks old and I HIGHLY recommend it, but that's neither here nor there) and they were having a mini-debate on vaccination.  Included on the panel was a woman whose organization fights to encourage parents to not vaccinate their children.

Now, Larry, being a presumably nice dude and not wanting to crush one of his guests or go after her too aggressively, let her have a whole lot of airtime and let many of her points go without being questioned or rebutted.  I was getting furious watching this--why does she get airtime?  Why is she being presented as any kind of authority or as anyone who has an opinion that deserves to be heard?

The fact of the matter is, certain things shouldn't be allowed to have a voice because they are WRONG.  Wrong meaning both factually incorrect and also immoral.  

There is no debate regarding vaccinations and autism.  There never was a debate.  There was a discredited ""study"" by a discredited ""doctor"" and anything since then has been sensationalism that has been allowed to metastasize by being ""fair and balanced"" and presenting both sides.  

We see this in news reports trying to give climate change deniers a chance to debate scientists.  One side is looking at statistical records, analysis of studies, and scientific evidence--facts whose implications will determine how livable this entire planet is moving forward--and the other side thinks it's just mumbo jumbo because how can global warming exist when the winters are getting colder?

The second side of the debate doesn't have a place.  It's not a side.  And it's not a debate.  It's fact.

The same goes for anti-vaccination activists.  The fact that they get any airtime, that the news media pose this as a ""debate"" on which you can have an opinion, is not only silly, it's dangerous.  It's promoting the idea that you can have an opinion on vaccinations, rather than spending that airtime explaining that vaccinations do NOT cause autism, that there is ZERO evidence promoting that idea, and that the people PROFITING from the vaccine ""debate"" are people like Jenny McCarthy, NOT pharmaceutical companies.  

I'd like to see other people's views on this.  Do you REALLY believe that ""both sides"" should be presented in arguments where there really are no sides?  Where it's fact versus fiction?  

I will say that there is room for debate on other things--I'm not just a blind liberal who wants to shut out all opposition to my views.  While I think trickle down economics doesn't work, that doesn't mean it can't be debated.  Many issues in politics, economics, and culture can have differing views and sides, and those should be questioned and discussed and distilled.  

But certain issues definitely SHOULD NOT be. 

**EDIT** 

So as the days have gone on, I have yet to see a convincing argument for why these people (conspiracy theorists, essentially, around things like global warming and vaccination) deserve to have their voices represented in the media as an equal participant to a doctor, researcher, aid worker, etc.  

A common response has been, they should be shown the errors in their logic!  If they're confronted by the lies in their arguments, or the illogic, they'll change their minds.  

Well, in today's /r/askscience thread, user /u/wdr1 posted the following excerpts from an AAP study:

&gt;http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/02/25/peds.2013-2365

&gt;RESULTS: None of the interventions increased parental intent to vaccinate a future child. Refuting claims of an MMR/autism link successfully reduced misperceptions that vaccines cause autism but nonetheless decreased intent to vaccinate among parents who had the least favorable vaccine attitudes. In addition, images of sick children increased expressed belief in a vaccine/autism link and a dramatic narrative about an infant in danger increased self-reported belief in serious vaccine side effects.

&gt;CONCLUSIONS: Current public health communications about vaccines may not be effective. For some parents, they may actually increase misperceptions or reduce vaccination intention. Attempts to increase concerns about communicable diseases or correct false claims about vaccines may be especially likely to be counterproductive. More study of pro-vaccine messaging is needed.

Based on the above, I still **strongly** believe that presenting anti-vaccination activists as ""experts"" or qualified medical voices in the effort of ""fair and balanced"" journalism is dangerous, destructive, and unnecessary.

**Another item** that has come up in the comments is folks trying to say I'm against free speech.  Not at all.  But there's a limitation to free speech in most countries, including the US, which is covered by the ideas of the [harm principle and offense principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harm_principle), most famously illustrated in the US by Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.'s assertion that [you can't falsely shout fire in a crowded theater](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shouting_fire_in_a_crowded_theater).  That idea, which I believe the anti-vaccination movement perfectly embodies, is **not** protected speech.  

I don't know if anyone is reading these edits, but I hope they spark continued discussion, as people seem to be really engaging with the topic--as a former teacher, yay!

**2nd EDIT -- IS ANYONE EVEN STILL READING THIS??** -- Just wanted to share this line from an [NPR piece](http://www.npr.org/2011/01/09/132735944/as-the-facts-win-out-vaccinations-may-too) from 2011 that was posted elsewhere today:

&gt;When the media puts celebrity and anti-vaccination advocate Jenny McCarthy alongside experts from the Center For Disease Control and Prevention, he says, it ""gives the impression that there's an equal number of people on two sides of this.  And it's just not true.""

That, my friends, is the crux of what I'm trying to say.

**FINAL EDIT CUZ I THINK I'M TOTALLY ALONE IN THIS THREAD NOW**

From the above-cited NPR piece:

&gt;Take the ""birther"" movement, which contends that Barack Obama was born in Kenya and therefore is not eligible to be president. In the summer of 2009, Orly Taitz, a Russian-born dentist/lawyer/real estate agent, almost single-handedly turned her one-woman media blitz into a national preoccupation. Taitz, who believes that the Federal Emergency Management Agency is building internment camps to house anti-Obama activists and that Venezuelan president Hugo ChÁvez controls the software that runs American voting machines, makes for undeniably good television: She looks like a young Carol Channing, sounds like an overexcited Zsa Zsa Gabor, and has the ability to make absurd accusations with a completely straight face. By midsummer, Taitz was appearing regularly on CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC, a decision the news channels justified with the risible pretext of needing to be fair to those on ""both sides"" of an issue about which there was nothing up for debate — at least not in the real world.

Ultimately, my V has not been C'ed.

Unchecked it could literally wipe out civilization as we know it.  We're already experiencing some negative effects from it (probably to a greater degree than we actually realize) and this is only going to exponentially grow. We've already moved past multiple 'tipping points' or 'last chances' to sort it out yet CO2 emissions actually continue to grow. Developing nations like India China, Indonesia, Nigeria will see that continue (fair enough considering us Western Nations also benefited from coal etc. Even our own industry/business continues to release so many gasses it's almost unbelievable (look up the CO2 emissions of large ships).

&amp;#x200B;

In the face of this problem most of our solutions are so small. On an individual level using a bike/public transport, choosing to become a vegetarian/vegan or getting solar panels have a completely negligible effect (even if millions upon millions are making these changes). Even on a country level instituting a carbon tax or investing more in renewable energy (at least in a non-drastic way) barely makes a scratch. Particularly for smaller countries. Even if these movements continue to majorly ramp up (at least in Western countries) we won't even come close to turning this ship. A fair few people actually believe this but take it in a different way (imo a more pessimistic way), believing that it just means we're doomed.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't. Scientific/technological advancement is incredible.  What we as a collective have achieved with the internet, mobile phones, computers, air-planes, space-flight, medicine and hundreds of other areas in relatively short spans of times is awe-inspiring. Yet some CO2 in the atmosphere is going to be the end of us? I mean come on, have some faith in science.

&amp;#x200B;

Global warming is definitely a problem we have to solve and we need to continue to put pressure on governments to pump money into science to fix it, (which incidentally they'll do themselves once we start feeling more serious effects from climate change) but all these individual efforts are just a complete waste of time. There's some value in 'being the change you want to see' and 'setting an example' but we'd be much better off saving our time and money and putting more pressure on big business/government who actually have the ability to solve the problem.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: While I haven't found anyone that has dissuaded me from my view that science is a far and away better option than relying on incremental change from individuals (and hence should be prioritized at all costs) I have opened my eyes a little more to the value of these small changes while science continues along in the background as measures taken 'just in case' that generally are beneficial to the person anyway. 

Am pretty steadfast in my opinion though that the view that incremental change on a global scale will enact changes quick enough is driven by just as much faith as my view about science. I just cannot see how these changes transition from rich westerners and go global in time for any sort of real preventative measures to be taken."	139	78

First off, a banana splits easier from the bottom so the likelihood of crushing part of the banana due to it not opening like it does when using the stem is much lower.

Secondly, the stem of a banana is very clearly a handle and should be used as such. Having the extra area to grab onto makes it much easier to hold and eat overall and when you are almost done eating it you still have a sold place to hold the peel by rather than having to take the whole banana out of the skin.

Thirdly, its how the monkey's do it. While humans have evolved away from them, they have had thousands of years to prefect the art of banana eating, and they do it from the bottom.

The final reason is a combination of the 3 previous; its the way nature intended it. Nature constantly creates structures in the most efficient way, from honey combs to ant hills or any number of other natural structures, they are made in a way that is the most efficient. So if you are not supposed to eat a banana from the bottom why is the stem a handle, why does the bottom split easier and why do monkeys eat it the correct way?


So please, incorrect banana eaters bring me to your side and change my view."	21	26	0.76

He is an amazing villain/character. 

While most of the protagonists in Songs of War are copy and pastes with little to no difference , however Ingressus is different. He is far different than Tygren of Pythus in how while they are conquers and radicals, Ingressus is just a broken man who wants to claim his birthright. 

His voice actor did an amazing job playing a sympathetic villain, his calm voice brings a sense of security but when Ingressus unleashes his rage you feel horrified and scared which works perfectly. 

Backstory:

Ingressus Voltaris was a boogeyman-like figure to the Ardoni in Songs of War, the Voltaris clan was banished due to their wish for a share of power and treated as fair game by other Ardoni clans. Ingressus was the prince of this clan and a man known as Thalleous ended up killing his father granting Ingressus, Voltar the staff of the Voltaris. This made him the Master of his Clan. He was adopted by the Master of the Nestoris Clan and raised under his roof. When the Nether invaded, Ingressus's brother Achilliean convinced Ingressus to join the competition for the Prime Songs to prove Voltaris aren't all bad, but due to being a Voltaris he was denied the songs. However, the influence of the Prime Songs drove him insane and caused him to go on a bloody rampage of no return. Branding him as the Deathsinger a boogeyman-like figure that haunts the world of Ardonia. 

When you hear about him, you'd think he'd be a mindless killer or a maniac, but instead we get a young man torn by his morals and his people. A product of the other clans' bigotry and lust for power. The stories you hear about him paint him as this 2D figure that is hellbent on war, but he is really just a kid who happened to be good at what he did. 

You can also feel his presence and being as the story goes on even when he isn't there. In the start of the series, we already see the product of everything Ingressus had done, low resources, near extinction, PTSD, and cultural changes. And in seasons 2 and 3, you have a feeling of what he is doing off-screen, scheming and planning it all out. 

He's also an extreme badass, the way he fights and moves just spells out badass. He confronts a demon and shows no sense of fear and instead reminds Pythus that he is stronger. He fighting style is quick and precise like he doesn't want to play with his food like Jalker or other villains he's here for business no questions no objections, he wants to get it done. And in his finale, he tanks multiple arrows across his body, a spear to the chest, and an axe to the shoulders and still has enough energy to climb to the top of a mountain. It goes to show why people truly feared the Deathsinger and his pure ferocity. 

This is why I find the Ingressus to be the most badass character in webseries, now change my mind."	0	4	0.13

I think that the founders of christianity we're either confused, tricked, made everything up, or simply didn't exist and were made up by someone else. 

I think that the concept of a god is impossible. An all knowing, all powerful being, outside of time with no beginning or end existing before there was a universe and creating said universe is crazy enough, but even *if* one did exist why would it wait some odd billion years for humans to come along and just to tell them how to behave. And what's with all those weird rules about like kosher and stuff?!

Also if god really is all powerful he wouldn't need to send his ""one and only son"" to earth to save humans he could just save all of us, and why does he need to save us anyway?

To be honest the term ""soul"" just seems like a sensationalistic way to describe someone's attitude and thoughts, basically their internal brain functions and sentience. I don't think that there is any afterlife and when we die we just cease to exist, we no longer think or feel anything basically like how it was before we were born, without a doubt terrifying, and that fear could be why so many people flock to religion and the concept of an afterlife moderated by some sort of perfectly just judge.

  I think the possibility of there not being life beyond earth to be more scary then the thought of aliens. We think of aliens (at least I used too) as ET ass mfs. But it could be a tree. There’s this particular planet [Kepler -186f](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/resources/2081/where-the-grass-is-always-redder/)( similar enough to earth that has a different star then we do, meaning the lightwaves would cause the trees in the planet to all be red instead of green. Doesn’t that observation alone prove the existence of aliens??? Aliens could be bacteria or tiny 1 cellular organisms , this is where I get into conspiracy mode . The 4th dimension , and beyond that is physically impossible to conceptualize to 3rd dimensional creatures such as us. Learn more here, video is very interesting. [here](https://youtu.be/JmvHNatZgVI) so
I wonder , what could live in the other dimensions alone? And sticking to just the 3rd dimension, scientists believe life needs the same basic ingredients (organic matter, water, and to be in the habitable zone of its star) and that’s just a hypothesis. How do we know other planets don’t have elements we don’t have ? We can assume the planets in our solar system are mostly composed of the same compounds in different amount’s  because the collision that caused our planets to be formed pretty much just shot into huge chunks that over time turned into our planets and moons. But way beyond our galaxy is there not a possibility for more elements to exist ? And these elements could potentially play much different roles in evolution then the elements we have here on earth. Maybe I’m a huge dummy but not believing In aliens seems more probable than them just not existing. I feel like perhaps we’ve found evidence of aliens and we condition ppl into not believing people. I mean think about it, when have u ever heard someone say “I saw a ufo” and your first reaction wasn’t “this bitch done lost their mind”  there have been sightings( supposedly, but hey some have weight to them imo) even on live footage sense before smart phones and digital editing. But take that with a grain of salt, this isn’t contingent to my argument I just find that there have been too many sightings for a couple to not be somewhat accurate right? But I’ll admit I’m reaching on that one. So basically I fully believe in aliens and maybe 5% think we’ve spotted them, or      entered our planet. Like how can they just not exist?



The article I listed doesn’t say there ARE plants on that planet, when I wrote this I remembered it wrong. We don’t know for sure there is plants on Kepler 186f and that was my Trojan horse so, yeah I still believe in them
but just wanted to make sure y’all know I wasn’t intentionally misleading anyone"	2	52	0.54

We made sure it was in a safe area (our patio), and we showed them how to do it safely. Light it, watch it burn, blow it out, hold it for a minute until cold, then put it somewhere safe like in a coffee can. After 4-5 sessions and a few burned fingers the thrill was gone and they rarely asked to do it again. Basically we let them ""play"" with matches whenever they wanted as long as we were there to supervise. 

Kids playing with matches is not really dangerous. But kids playing with matches while hiding in the closet can be deadly."	175	109	0.79

This is shit. 

Now I am fully aware that the media is for the most part incredibly biased in how they inform their electorate, but impartial information is still freely available for people to use. The existence of the internet makes ignorance a completely illegitimate excuse. 

Sure you could say that not everyone has access to the internet, I disagree. If you can vote, I'm more than willing to bet you have some kind of internet access. If not, go to the library, order a manifesto, read a newspaper, read some easy to digest books on politics.

I'm not trying to be elitist or insinuate people are stupid or wrong for voting the way they do. But I do honestly think that election results would be vastly different if people were more educated in what they were voting for."	0	79	0.42

Miracles happen and single game records fall. 

Yes, Bill Russell's 13 rings will probably never be broken either, but I consider that to be a qualitatively different type of accomplishment versus what is feasibly accomplishable under today's rules of the game.  I say this because there were only 8-14 teams in the Bill Russell NBA era. 

But no one could play 48+ a game for a whole season today.  How would players like LeBron, KD, Steph, and Westbrook hold up if they never left the game?  Could they sustain the level of play that Wilt did?  I doubt it.  I don't think they would be particular bad in the additional ~10-12 mins per game, but I think the coach is still best responding by sitting them more.  I think the coach correctly conjectures that the marginal increase in production from having more rested stars outweighs the cost of being without them for small bits of game time.

Wealth inequality is at an all time high and there’s a significant amount of people today who are extremely angry and hopeless and easily radicalized.

I think this scenario revolves around the 2024 election. Why the election? A poll recently came out saying that a majority of Iowa Republican voters believe the 2020 elected from rigged. When people lose face in the election system, they might turn to alternative means of getting their candidate in power, as they already tried in 2021 with Jan 6.

I think Republican congressmen and states will refuse to accept the results of the election and stage a much more violent and extreme version of January 6, this will cause the country to split and chaos to ensue. If part of the military defects then it’ll be a full blown war. If not, then things could still get pretty violent in an insurgency. I don’t see any indication of this not happening since they refused to condemn the events of January 6 and have been continually escalating the rhetoric. 

Possible counter arguments I’ll address here:

-People are too comfortable - yes, most people are happy to be on their new iPhones and so on, but there’s a non-insignificant part of the population that is extremely angry and on the edge, it doesn’t take a huge group to cause chaos. There doesn’t need to be a huge economic downturn for this to occur, there wasn’t a huge recession before the U.S. civil war from 1860.

-There isn’t a clear geographic split like in 1860, right and left are mixed together. While this is true, there are still geographic divisions today. And even in 1860, a lot of people either wanted nothing to do with the war or actively sympathized with the other side, like copperheads. 

Again, I really hope this doesn’t happen and I hope you’ll convince me that I shouldn’t worry about this."	1	260	0.31

I did not vote for Trump (Johnson) but did vote R the rest of the way down the ballot. I am socially liberal and economically conservative. I support gay rights and gay marriage. 

1. At the heart of the matter is religion. Most all western religions view homosexuality as a sin. Sin, however, requires action. Therefore, having the temptation to sin is not a sin, but actually having gay sex is (doctrine). In his mind, and others like him, they are separating the sin from the person. The maxim ""Love the sinner, hate the sin"" comes to mind. 

2. Because he views it this way, his intentions in supporting conversion therapy (albeit ill informed) were to HELP, not hurt. Intentions are important if HATE is the charge. For hate to be the diagnosis, a desire to help is asymptomatic. On top of that, there were patients/ students who were claiming at the time that it had worked for them. (Those claims have been retracted). 

Thank you

EDIT: I would also like to add, gay conversion therapy gets attributed to Mike Pence unfairly. He does support Focus on the Family (which does support gay conversion therapy) but that is not the only thing they do. They also offer services to single parents, and marital counseling. James Dobson, at a time when nearly all other Christian organizations were denigrating and actually hating gay people, tried to include gay people. His methodology was faulty, but his heart was in the right place. He also had multiple people go through the therapy and say they had been cured (some have even apologized for that), so he thought it was working, and thought he was doing the right thing. He was wrong, but his intentions were not to inflict pain but rather, in his eyes, rescue people from it. Still, that is James Dobson... Mike Pence isn't nearly that involved. "	0	84

They’re wasting time on their phone accomplishing nothing other than increasing their jealousy and anxiety while they can be spending that time being productive. All independence and privacy has gone out the window to oversharing and following meaningless trends. 

TikTok is the worst iteration of this. The algorithm is specifically made to influence young people’s worldview. From the moment you create an account you’re bombarded with dangerous messaging. Gen Z is completely addicted to this, and the platform is now where the youngest generation is receiving their news. Why does China have a different version of TikTok? It’s almost like they know it’s poison, so they don’t want to give it to their youth, but are happy to give it to western youth. There are obviously also concerns about the Chinese government using this app to steal personal information from its users.

Is there actually a positive argument to be made for social media? How can anyone think spending time on your phone and watching what people (most of whom you don’t know) are up to is anything other than idiotic?"	1008	395	0.86

For example, back in the 70s and 80s many films - including mainstream ones - had nude scenes, something you don't really see anymore in big blockbusters such as *Thor: Love and Thunder*.

Anime, which is ironically more and more sexualized nowadays on the outside, is more censored than the past when it comes to the ""details"". 70s and 80s anime had lots of shower scenes and bare-naked female bodies, but recently UY was redone for broadcast television and [the main character's nipples](https://twitter.com/switchpoint/status/1581402317316050944), which were shown in the original anime, were instead censored by covering them with strands of her hair. [This article](https://www.cbr.com/anime-too-old-reboot-urusei-yatsura/) also discusses this in more detail and explains how TV standards have tightened in Japan. In my country, in the 1970s and 1980s, a lot of ultra-violent and rather sexual anime were broadcast on TV without censorship at lunchtime; try that today and you will have angry parents yelling at you.

Now, I think there needs to be SOME sort of regulation on what you can broadcast or not, and I can't exactly pinpoint the cause for these growing restrictions despite the liberalization and secularization of our societies. But I think that in some ways, we are more restricted than decades ago.

- Males are simply seen as expendable in ways women are not. The only form of legal slavery that still looms in western cultures: the draft, where a government can order you to go kill and be killed anywhere in the world, is still by large, seen as unthinkable to include women in. 

- Male victims of rape, violence, and abuse is at best, met with indifference, but equally as often, treated as a literal punch line or baseless partisan talking points. Yet all social campaigns for change paint the exact opposite picture, as if it's female abuses which are ignored. 

- Rape is treated as far more serious than murder or even torture, and it seems obvious that this is due to the majority of the victims of rape, being female. One can joke about murder, rap about murder, depict it in videos, show gore videos galore of murder, yet none of the same is true of rape. This becomes more apparent when the only notable exception to this rule, is the rape of males in prison (though not always limited to prison: think Chris Hansons rape in the comedy show ""the boondocks""). This is not only able to be depicted regularly, but often serves as cultural comedy. If this was simply a case of indifference to criminals, then one would expect female prison rape to be treated in a similar manner, yet female prison rape is treated as far more seriously. 

- Female prison sentences for equal crimes are consistently much more lenient. One has to look no further than the many cases of teachers having sexual relations with students, where the trend is often females who commit equal or even greater crimes, sometimes serve zero time in prison whatsoever. This entire dynamic is often treated as a big joke as well. 

- Women are nearly always given the assumption of purer intentions in social situations. From commenting or talking to a child on the street, offering to babysit, speaking to a stranger of the opposite sex, or helping someone with car trouble, society seems to operate under ""innocent until proven sinister"" for women and ""creep until proven innocent"" for males. 

- Social norms dictate that one has a duty to protect women who are being threatened or attacked by any male. Yet when the opposite occurs, this too is seen as funny. The ""how can she slap"" video is of course, one of the most widely known depictions of this phenomenon, but it is widespread. If one takes a domestic abuser, swaps his gender, it becomes simply ""feisty"" or ""fiery"". Sometimes this is on the basis of the ""innocent until proven sinister"" doctrine. other times it is based around the inherent feeling that females are to be protected.  

- The old women and children first doctrine. This of course, was never a hard rule, yet everyone seems to kind of just ""know"" that this is the right thing to do. The implication clearly implying that they, like children, are innocents who should be protected/saved. From the Titanic, to bomb shelters, to fire rescues, to police rescues, hostage negotiations and beyond, this doctrine has not changed one bit with the times.

Example 1:  If a politician wants to change SNAP or WIC benefits, they should have to gather a group of likeminded politicians to have a third party set up a timeframe in which these people would live through the changes they make.  Even in this environment, they wouldn’t get the true experience because they know it’s temporary - but any extra insight would theoretically help the everyday person.

Example 2:  You work in a call center, you’ve been informed by your boss that the average call time expectation has dropped by 10 seconds.  Without this setup : You’ve never met the person who makes these decisions, you don’t know if they’ve ever done your job or if they just read reports and decide changes that way.  With this setup : You know the people who changed the policy had to perform in your position for a set amount of time /with some degree of success/ - you don’t like the change, but you understand that it’s reasonable as the people who make these decisions don’t regularly do your job, so if they can hit it, you can hit it.

Certain things would be harder to follow this setup for, but it would benefit the people in the bottom and middle classes immensely.  Even knowing the decision makers aren’t getting the true experience, the facsimile of it should be enough to make kinder decisions."	15	20	0.69

The basic idea is to preserve any extraterrestrial environments that may harbor life by not accidentally introducing Earth life. This has been enforced, to an extent, by the [Outer Space Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Space_Treaty) Article IX: ""... States Parties to the Treaty shall pursue studies of outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, and conduct exploration of them so as to avoid their harmful contamination and also adverse changes in the environment of the Earth resulting from the introduction of extraterrestrial matter and, where necessary, shall adopt appropriate measures for this purpose...""

 I disagree with the concept of planetary protection. It provides the view that the Universe sans Earth has a 'Do Not Touch' sign on it. However, the goal of life is to spread. Whether accidentally or on purpose, life has 'infested' every corner of our planet, so there should be no reason to stop life artificially at this point. 

Another argument against planetary protection, at least on Mars, is the fact that asteroid impacts have been shown to carry impact fragments between Earth and the red planet, implying that if Earth life could live on Mars, it would be already, and vice-versa. 

In addition, Elon Musk (and others, of course) want life to spread to, and ultimately terraform, Mars. If the idea of planetary protection and the related OST clause were to last, even a manned Mars landing probably wouldn't be allowed. (The astronauts would need to live in-situ until a transfer window, unlike Apollo.) Now, for the record, neither I nor many astronomers believe the OST will last; it's too idealistic. However, it seems like so many people support planetary protection there is just no argument to be had (thanks, reddit!).

 **In summary**, planetary protection breaks the logical path of life for sentimentality, impedes interplanetary exploration, and is overly idealistic. Reddit, change my view.


EDIT: For those who have read it, *Red Mars* by Kim Stanley Robinson examines this issue a bit more. For those who have read it, feel free to discuss it.

Regardless of (at least most) religions, or rather what they believe happens to you after death, most everyone can agree that you are only given one opportunity at the life you currently are living.  By trying to live to your full potential, your aim will be to achieve the most that you can with what you are given.  This means stretching and challenging yourself mentally and physically.  I feel that this allows you to contribute the most that you can to the world, and will lead to a happy and fulfilling life.  

This means instead of being content with flipping burgers, pushing for the managerial role, asking about, learning, and applying whatever it takes to get there, where you can positively impact those below you.  Then pushing to become a franchise owner of your own, and giving jobs and opportunity to people that wouldn't otherwise, positively impacting the world.  And certainly not just related to work.  This means if you want to be an artist, not simply being content with your 1 hour of practice a day, but putting forth maximum effort to see what works you can create, to see how good you can become, to allow others to enjoy your masterpieces and bring joy to their life that they would have otherwise never seen or heard without your personal strive to maximize your talent.  It means not being content with surfing the internet all Sunday, but instead perhaps for a few of those hours, getting out into the community to help a common cause, whether it be in a peaceful rally behind a belief you feel strongly in, volunteering at an animal hospital, or aiding in a clean up effort of your local park. All things well within your potential, but that are simply easier to not do.

I am not suggesting to never take breaks, or to always be on the ball.  I am suggesting to always have the goal in the back of your mind to be the best that you can, to improve your own life and everyone elses, because you only have one try at it, and that while it is the harder road to travel, I feel that doing so will bring you a much more rewarding and positive experience here on Earth.

I am also really hoping to hear other povs.

Cosmetic surgery like nose jobs or face lifts or even stuff like lip fillers and botox (which is not ecactly surgery i think) are becoming a lot more trendy and popular and most people don't see anything wromg with it and their main argument being that if getting a nose job for example makes somebody more confident and happy then there is nothing wrong with it. 

Now that is totally something i can understand and even agree with to some extent. However, where i disagree is that getting a cosmetic surgery or altering the way you look permanently is no way whatsoever the solution. 

Most people's insecurities stem from something that has been said to them and that stuck with them. Comments about how big a person's forehead is or how their nose doesn't look right or how there lips are non-existent do a shit ton of damage. And then people in the beauty industry misuse this to further exploit people's insecurities and make money by selling this image that they can 'fix' your face and everything you have been told is wrong with it. 

If a person decides to get rhinoplasty, i am not saying it's their fault. But at some point in their life, somebody made them feel as if there was something wrong with their nose and it's shape. It was too big or too flat or what not. And my point is, this shouldn't have happened. Getting a surgery just further reinforces this image of perfection and then paves the way for other people to be just as insecure. It becomes this never ending cycle where you can't fit the image of what's pretty or beautiful until you change yourself. And all this because a few shitty ass people decided to comment on your nose and so now everytime you look in the mirror, the only thing you see is everything that's wrong with your nose. 

Let's say you get whatever procedure you do get done to feel beautiful, there is still no pleasing people because now, you will have a new group of shitty ass people telling you how you look fake or 'what did she do to her lips' or 'atleast i am not plastic' or 'you look like every other girl now'. So in the end it's a full circle that ends up with never being enough. 

This is my main point. There is a lot wrong with cosmetic surgery and procedures. It doesn't mean you suddenly accept and love yourself now because truly you don't. You just love the version of you that other people wanted you to be. 

Anyways this is just my take on it, would love to hear other views!"	8	47	0.7

Feminism is just bad. Why? Because there are so many definitions and deifferent aspects it is hard to know which is actually real nowadays. Let me give you an example. We have feminist who hide their misandry under ""factual criticism"", and say the dumbest things ever. Then we have a bunch of other people who say ""Oh, most feminists are not actually like that"" when they ARE actually like that. And I am starting to realise feminism isn't equality nowadays, maybe it used to, but it isn't. It is usually just people who hate men. They say ""helping one gender helps the other"" while they actively do stuff like this and then post articles like this. That just isn't ""equality"" it is supremacy of one gender. And then when someone actually comes forward and says all of this, they are ""a tool of the partiarchy, mysogynist"" or have ""internalized mysogny"". It is all so stupid. And no, please don't say below ""not all feminists are like this"" because yes, some people aren't like that, but I want to know if there is something I am missing or wrong in.  
  
Now onto other things, such as rape and child support. First lets look into rape: You can get your life ruined by 1 false allegation made by a woman, made possible by the #meetoo movement. Don't get me wrong, it is/was a good movement, but the pendulum swings both ways. I would like to suggest 2 videos made by GEN, the youtuber is really good. Quick side note: the gender pay gap isn't real in the western society. Now child support. I am not here to comment on how men pay child support more often than women, there are reasons to that, but I would like to say is that a woman has a choice not to pay it. Now, lets say a woman gets pregnant. She has the right to abort the baby, and if she doesn't, the father has to pay child support\\stay with the kid for 18 years. Now, I know many of you will say ""sHOuLD, HAVe KePt it IN hIs PaNTs"" but that can swing both ways so don't even BOTHER.  
  
Now, I will say the only place I see fit for feminism is in the eastern society, where sexism and prejudice still resides, but such thing does not exist in western society"	1	26	1.0

It is a combination of genetics, habits, self discipline, financial status, whether or not they care enough about their body (or can afford) to take action to improve or maintain it, etc. 

Obviously, it’s far more complex and this is a generalization. But hopefully you can understand what I’m getting at. 

I (25F) had braces when I was young, and maintained perfect teeth for a while. But of course I didn’t wear my retainer long enough and fucked it all up. I also suffered many years of depression after my father died when I was 13 and almost entirely stopped brushing my teeth for a few years. 

Somehow I miraculously had no cavities up until a few years ago (I now have 3 small fillings). Good genetics are likely a big factor. And my teeth are still in pretty good shape, but that rough patch really did some long term damage that will come out later in life. I drink a lot of coffee and tea, so my teeth are a bit stained. I have fidgety habits of chewing my lip and clenching my teeth and they have shifted to reflect these habits. 

Nice teeth are not a requirement but is something that is high up on my list of priorities for a future partner. Research shows that cavities and gum disease are technically contagious, since you swap a lot of oral bacteria when kissing and you alter each others microbiome a. So the oral status of your partner will definitely impact you to some degree."	1	0	1.0

Secondly, I don’t like Mr. Putin, don’t watch the official TV programs, etc.

The short description of my point of view (I'm Russian).

Russians do not consider the loss of the Cold war as a loss at war. From the internal point of view, Russians had rid of the USSR. And its crash was bloodless only because nobody wanted to protect it. After 1991, Russia was really into trying to become part of the world. The first years of Putin in power was the years of trying to start cooperation with NATO firstly and then to be part of a big Europe “from Lisbon to Vladivostok”. 

All these initiatives did not meet with the understanding of Western countries.  That period finished with the Putin’s Munich speech on 10 February 2007.

After that, Russia started to look for other ways of integration. Trying to develop Eurasian Customs Union, Eurasian Economic Union. Mostly because of economic reasons. Since the global market was already apportioned.
 
The key point of the existent of Eurasian Economic Union was the participation of Ukraine in the project. As soon as the agreement was signed, the Maidan started in the Ukraine and it led to the change of power in the country. Of course, it had the internal reasons, people were unhappy with the corrupt and uneducated government. Apart from that, the coup was widely welcomed by the West. 

All those steps of NATO expanding were making Russia nervous, for it obviously aims to confront Russia. Russia doesn’t have any natural borders as a mountain, Russian – Ukrainian border is approx. 2000 kilometers flat and easy to invade.  Getting the powerful hostile military block on country's border and US fleet in Sebastopol is absolutely unacceptable. 
Therefore Russia has decided to take Crimea back. As a defensive step. Russia needed the whole Ukraine as a partner, but if the things had been gone that bad it’s last and only hope to feel safe is to have Crimea. 

A small note. Crimea has never really been Ukranian. The major inhabitants there are Russian and they really want to be part of Russia. I’ve been to Crimea in 2010 and 2013 before and such patriotic people as there couldn’t be found even in Russia! It is absolutely clear that referendum there reflected reality. Despite this Russia wouldn’t took it back if Ukraine had stayed neutral or been involved in some kind of partnership with Russia.

My opinion is that annex of Crimea is the defensive act of last hope.

In a short time we've heard of attacks increasing in frequency and since then, there has been a lot of debate as to whether or not the targets of these crime are non white because the attackers are racist. I personally don't believe it. I think these criminals are violent idiots who are choosing the most vulnerable victims. Victims that unfortunately are various races.

Just to be clear I am outraged over such these heinous actions and I do believe these criminals should be convicted of the crimes they commit. This however is not a hate crime and allowing the media to stoke fear against a certain group of people is dangerous."	10	28

Not to mention terrible health which lead to crisis like the plague.

I think the middle east is currently in the middle of their own dark ages. The culture is the same. Women have few rights, religion rules day to day life, and is used as justification for terrible actions (akin to the inquisitions), and knowledge and culture is being lost and destroyed at alarming rates.

Eventually, the people of the middle east will tire of such a terrible, hateful culture, and pull themselves out of it and back into the light. It might take awhile, but hopefully it doesn't take the 800 years that it takes the west.

There are so many similarities it is impossible not to see if you think about it.

Generally, the feeling is felt strongly by the right, who are more protective of their patriotism, though obviously they are not unique in this sentiment.

I want to speak broadly, and not specifically go into any examples (although we're currently in the midst of exactly what I'm describing now with Kap). If someone is critical of their country, and you respond with, ""Well if you don't like it, you should leave"", you have wasted everyone's valuable time.

I see absolutely no logic or reason to this. It is embarrassingly obvious that people tend to be critical of and stand up to things they perceive as negatives--things that should be fixed or rectified. Clearly, these people want their country to be fixed. I do not see anything unpatriotic about wanting your country to be the best it can be. I'm sure if the person hated their country, they *would* leave. They want to fix it, and things can more easily be fixed from within.

This is especially stupid when said of people who clearly lack the ability to leave the country, like college-age protesters who more-or-less can *not* leave.

At best, this sentiment is just a way of people to reject another's argument by taking ownership over what is and what is not patriotic. It's an appeal to emotion, telling people ""This guys not patriotic enough, so why listen to him!?""

1. This is a light-hearted topic so I am being half facetious.  Having said that, as ludicrous as the whole thesis seems, I do think that my logic is sound (thus the CMV).
2. It is difficult to define what it means by ""pro-AI"", but in this context, I am referring to acting in a manner that would be considered supportive of AI/computing technology.  For example, a person who works in developing AI algorithms etc. would be considered ""pro-AI"".  Given that this is difficult for most of us, perhaps making small donations to AI research would be something that would also be considered ""pro-AI"".
3. By ""useful"", I mean that it might be beneficial to our well-being.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

A) With advancement in AI technology, there is a chance that some time in the nearby future, there will be an AI takeover such that AI robots start to rule over the Earth.  This type of existential risk from artificial general intelligence is NOT a fringe crackpot theory as many renowned AI researchers believe in this possibility.

B) It is conceivable that even in the existential risk threat, some humans might be spared by the AI overlords.  And my argument is that with everything else equal, it seems like the one who would be spared would be the ones who were pro-AI (as opposed to neutral-AI or anti-AI).  At the opposite spectrum, it would be difficult for me to fathom that the people who were anti-AI would be the ones spared.

C) One reason on this type of generosity shown to the pro-AI humans is that this type of a move (i.e. sparing the supporter, perishing the opposition) is baked into our human DNA as well.  And given that we would be at the forefront of creating these AI robots, they might share similar characteristics as us (we would program that in).

D) It is not exactly clear to me on what would qualify as being pro-AI.  But I suspect that any move that we have made to promote or to expedite artificial general intelligence would be considered pro-AI.  Even for non-experts, it could be as simple as making regular donations to AGI research.

E) It is conceivable that the AI overlords would have a gigantic big database of all of our actions/moves in the future and as such, good deeds from us will not go unnoticed.

F) Compared to the potential upside, I don't see that much downside to this.

Some final thoughts.

\- I will NOT be convinced by an argument trying to dissuade AGI.  There is enough probability that this will occur here such that this just seems uninteresting for me given that I am not making the strong claim that it is certain that AGI would materialize.

\- I can be convinced that this would be a waste of money, but this can also be negotiated by the amount of donation or effort.

\- There is an argument to be made that even if this scenario does not materialize during our lifetime, it might eventually happen some time in the future, and there might be some resurrection type of a technology that can benefit the dead pro-AI people.

\- I guess I should reveal that I am an atheist and I am operating from that religious framework, so any religious argument will not convince me.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:  the faction argument was quite convincing as there is a risk when it comes to supporting the loser and being punished for the support (as opposed to not doing anything).  So consider this CMV closed. "	3	13	0.58

CMV.	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1m1nku/morality_is_as_real_and_rational_as_healthcare/	"Many people claim that nothing is *truly* right or wrong, that morality is just a byproduct of culture and that all moralities are equal - other cultures can't be morally inferior or superior to our culture. 

I believe this is mistaken. Nobody argues that all hospitals are equal or that healthcare is equally good in every place on earth. It's clear that some zoos [care well](http://www.ratestogo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/animal-kingdom.jpg) for their animals while others [abuse them](http://www.britannica.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/elephant1.jpg).

I don't think it makes sense to claim that morality is less real and rational and more relative than the examples I just mentioned. The only things that can be affected by our choices are conscious beings. Your keyboard or a stone can't experience pain, desire or happiness - it doesn't care in the slightest about your decisions. 

But to conscious beings, your behavior *does* matter. I can go to my family or pets right now and harm them - or help them. I can cause them to suffer to experience well-being. 

It doesn't make sense to tell anybody to act in the best interest of a rock, but we can behave in ways that maximize well-being and minimize suffering. This is the only relevant definition of morality. 

And while there might not always be clear answers in practice, there are clear answers *in principle*. From the range of choices available to us, some lead to happiness while others cause suffering. This is a real difference that can be researched and understood rationally. 

And just like people can make wrong choices that lead to misery and destruction, cultures can do this too. I think it's very plausible that circumcising young girls and stoning homosexuals to death leads to more suffering instead of more well-being, and that cultures that value these acts are less moral than cultures that condemn them. 

**I don't understand why anyone would disagree with this, but my opinion seems to be unpopular in many circles. Please CMV!**"	6	35

*  Income tax is the government saying to citizens that their earnings are not their own. That government has a claim on them and that claim precedes your own.
* The government allows you to keep some of your income, not because it's your right but because you have a need
* There is no limit on how much income the government could decide to take from you
* Before 1913 there was no income tax. It was only passed because it was pitched as a tax on the very wealthy only. Over time, it trickled down to affect almost everybody (hence the hesitation on a 70% tax on income over 10 million; That could easily start to slowly dwindle down to 100k per year or less)
* If you believe that you own your own labor; that it isn't owned by anyone else, then you should believe that income tax is theft
* Imagine I am running a charity to feed the poor, but not enough people are donating so I cannot feed all of the poor people in my community. So I hold rich people at gunpoint and take their money from them so I can feed all of the poor people in my community. Would you consider this to be theft? Just because there is a social benefit does not mean I didn't take their money from them without consent.
* There is no ""agreement"" to pay income tax. I never signed anything. The use of government services isn't relevant, since I'm taxed the same whether I use them or not.
* I am not properly represented in congress. I get to vote for my state representatives, and I get to vote for President. But even if I were to vote for a staunch anti-tax candidate, and they were elected, all the other members of congress from other states still get to decide what is done with the earnings they stole from me.

Overall, two things about ""taxation is theft"" are often mis-represented here on CMV, and other formats as well:

1. It isn't all tax that is theft, it's income tax
2. The point of ""income tax is theft"" is to make the burden of spending responsibly more apparent and visible. The government should recognize that it is stealing from its citizens when making spending decisions. The citizens should recognize their money is being stolen and demand more responsible spending. Whether it's been Trump, Obama, or anyone else in office, we as a country are far too apathetic about how the government spends our money."	0	105

Anyone left out of the loop the second amendment reads as follows:

&gt;A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.

Ok, the first thing I get when I bring this up is that I'm ""anti-gun"". Most people (that I've talked to) seem to think that the second amendment just says ""Right to bear arms"" period, dot. Well it does, but it qualifies that with two very important sentences before. My argument is two fold:

1) ""being necessary to a free state"" made sense 200 years ago.  People who were trying to protect their land were on a fairly equal level, militarily, as the government. Some would say that's why our revolution worked. Plus the uncertainty of the times, political power, etc. probably made this a pretty awesome right. Fast forward to 2016: our country hasn't experienced a civil war for 150 years. Military technology has FAR (FAR FAR FAR) outpaced civilian arms. So not only is the political strife not as real (I mean real like kill you and take your house, not Trump vs Hilary fighting) it would be laughable to even think that any weapon you could get your hand on would even make the U.S. military bat an eye. As Jim Jeffries said: ""You're bringing a gun to a drone fight""

2) Repealing the 2nd amendment does not make guns illegal, it just doesn't provide a RIGHT to them. State by state could decide, and in my imagination there would be states (Oregon, New Hampshire) that could possibly vote to outlaw them, and states (Texas, Arizona) that would further remove restrictions on them. By taking it out of the constitution it becomes vastly more a state by state thing, which would (imo) appease much more people. You're from California, think that the rednecks in Texas shoot everybody all the time? That affects where you let your kid go to college. You from Texas and think the pussies in California are too lax and you feel your daughter would be unsafe there? That would affect where you let her go to college. 

I think I'm into something, but I'm fully open to intelligent counter replies. Thanks Reddit!"	12	138

When listening to the soundtrack I'd always assume that there would be scenes or something in between each song, but once I saw it on Disney+, I realized that there was literally no speaking parts to change it up. They would transition with instrumentals and dancing instead.

If you look at what musicals are, like say Dear Evan Hansen or even Frozen, they are typically speech based, the songs serving to highlight emotions when necessary. If you look at operas, like Il travatore, the plot is the singing. All the lines are sung. Overall, Hamilton's organization is similar to the latter. 

I know that the singing style is very different. Hamilton's music is more modern and also we can understand what they're singing about, but I still think despite this, it is more like an opera."	5	24	0.63

1. Even though Hitler was a vegetarian, what wonderful people with notably *positive* contributions to society, were/are also vegetarians?

2. What evidence is there that vegetarianism does not trigger suicidal tendencies? (Or will even reduce said tendencies?) ^(Hitler had suicidal tendencies too; hopefully his diet didn't make it so.)

3. How do I do this on a thrifty grocery budget?

4. How many more vegetarians live past 100 as opposed to meat eaters and other types of eaters?"	0	17

This applies to all sorts of things, from dividends, to selling property at greater value, to stock sales.

The theory behind stock sales being included in this is that we want to encourage the rich to invest in the economy, pumping money in so that those who are not so wealthy have the ability to climb their way up.

The problem is that it introduces instability into the market.  It makes short term gains, which drive up stock prices at the cost of long term viability (see: mortgage crisis, Enron), more appealing than the steady, long term growth that is good for the economy as a whole (or even steady, profitable non-growth).

To remedy this problem, I think it'd be worthwhile to tax stock sales at the regular income rate.  That way those with money to invest would have more incentive to invest for the long haul, rather than just for today in a ""I got mine, damn the rest of you"" sort of fashion.

I'd put in an exception for retirement funds, etc, up to a certain amount, with the standard penalties if you withdraw early, that sort of thing, but other than that, any stock sales would be taxed as though it were part of your normal income.

...but I'm quite certain that this idea, and the results and effects of it, are too complex for me to understand with just my own processing, so I come to you rational folks.

I believe that taxing (most) stock sales as regular income would have a beneficial, stabilizing effect on the economy, CMV."	12	16

It seems either my values are so warped they're completely distinct from most people's, or most people just haven't seriously considered the fact that murder is sometimes a net positive. I deleted it, probably for the better, and I'm going to state my position here in a more straightforward manner.

I do not care if fetuses are humans. It is entirely irrelevant to my position on abortion. I don't think most abortions kill things that could be considered human, but even if they did, it wouldn't matter. Classifying things as people does not make their deaths more tragic in and of themselves. It is very sad when adults die, but that is because their death is usually meaningful to them and to other humans, not because they are humans. When unborn babies without the capacity to feel pain are removed to the betterment of all who ever knew of their existence, it should be trivial to tell the difference between me walking into a woodchipper. 

Assuming these month old conceived fetuses are babies, allowing women to kill their babies under this circumstance is good. Assuming they are not humans, allowing women to abort their pregnanices is good. Whatever the fuck you want to call it, it is the same action and it has the same consequences. Nobody suffers. These debates over whether or not a pack of cells is a member of our species is not in search of some objective characteristic that would make their death intrinsically worse, they're discussions of our own subjective interpretations of the definition of human. That definition and that social status has no bearing on the morality of our actions. Killing jewish people is not OK because your society did not choose to call them human beings. Conversely, killing fetuses is not somehow evil because you named them people and you think it means every death has the same weight of a murder of a live adult person.

That the British holding of Northern Ireland was an illegitimate and imperialist act. Hell, some people still think that today. Believe me when I say I'm capable of identifying British imperialism/atrocities like the Empire and the Suez crisis, but the 1973 referendum proves that there was no legitimacy to the claim that Northern Ireland should be returned to Ireland by force.

From Wikipedia:

The Northern Ireland sovereignty referendum of 1973 (also known as the Border Poll) was a referendum held in Northern Ireland on 8 March 1973 on whether Northern Ireland should remain part of the United Kingdom or join with the Republic of Ireland to form a united Ireland.

The Unionist parties supported the 'UK' option, as did the Northern Ireland Labour Party and the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland. However, the Alliance Party was also critical of the poll. While it supported the holding of periodic plebiscites on the constitutional link with Great Britain, the party felt that to avoid the border poll becoming a ""sectarian head count"", it should ask other relevant questions such as whether the people supported the UK's White Paper on Northern Ireland.

On 23 January 1973, the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) called on its members ""to ignore completely the referendum and reject this extremely irresponsible decision by the British Government"". Gerry Fitt, leader of the SDLP, said he had organised a boycott to stop an escalation in violence.

...

The vote resulted in an overwhelming majority of those who voted stating they wished to remain in the UK. The nationalist boycott contributed to a turnout of only 58.7% of the electorate. In addition to taking a majority of votes cast, the UK option received the support of 57.5% of the total electorate. According to the BBC, less than 1% of the Catholic population turned out to vote.

--

In my opinion, Republican groups boycotted the referendum because they knew that they could not win. Despite their boycott, a majority of Northern Irish people voted for the UK, and assuming everyone who did not vote would have voted to join Ireland, the result would have been the same.

While some of the IRA's demands for greater rights for Catholics might have had merit, their main plank of rejoining the Republic had no merit, and they were far from a popular movement fighting tyrannical government, more a radical group trying to impose their ideology on a population that did not support it. Their use of violence against civilians and military forces was illegitimate at the very least after March 1973 when these results were known.

The primary fear of a person having their account connected to their real life identity is doxxing. Doxxing is when someone exposes publicly, someone elses private personal information that they did not want to be made public. Therefore, if a given person doesn't put any information they wouldn't mind being public on reddit, such as private opinions, then doxxing by definition wouldn't be possible.


For example, every celebrity that has ever done an AMA has their reddit username associated with their name irl. In other words, that particular user account name is not anonymous and is publicly known who it is irl, and that person in real life is not negatively impacted by this knowledge.

Most people have a facebook with their real name, and those are publically searchable by anyone with an internet connection (and a working fb account [and fake fb accts are very easy to make]).

Your reddit account that is associated with your name irl faces no more risk of harm to yourself than a celebrity's AMA account or your publically searchable facebook account.

Unfortunately, thanks to my views not being in line within the dichotomy, none of the current major presidential candidates, republican or democrat, are completely in line with my views. I want to vote for a third party, but it would just be a protest vote every time I do.

The two parties directly oppose each other ideologically, but will fight tooth and nail at the prospect of a newcomer. A major third party and threatening them? How dare they, the two-party system is the only way they keep at least 40% of the vote every single election no matter what. They don't want added complexity, which is why [in the last election, a candidate needed at least 15% of the vote in polls to participate in a debate, which universally shut out everyone except Obama and Romney.](http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=candidate-selection-process).

There will be a few third party candidates who will gain upsets and get elected, but it will never be enough to change the system thanks to our First Past the Post voting system, gerrymandered districts, and just the fact that the two main parties are far more resourced than all of the others. Even if their views change, we will never have more than two parties in the United States, at least for the next 100 years. Change my view."	4	31

One of the ways that is discussed is implementing a carbon tax that would be levied on sources of carbon emissions. Simply levying a tax on carbon is the wrong move in my opinion.  It would be incredibly regressive, and depending on how that tax money is spent by the government, could lead to lots of wasted money and/or projects that are borderline corruption. 

I think the best way to implement a carbon tax is to ensure that the government doesn't spend any of the tax money that is collected - instead, the government should distribute the carbon tax back to the citizens and legal residents of the country in the form of monthly dividend payments, minus administrative costs. Every month you would receive a check (or direct deposit) that would be from the carbon taxes collected the previous period.  Regardless of your income you would receive this money, and what you do with it is up to you. 

This curbs carbon emissions in two ways: It discourages carbon use because it is now more expensive for the end consumer. Filling up your F-350 every week is going to cost you a lot more money than it would have if there were no carbon tax.   And it also provides a positive incentive to consumers because they will be financially rewarded by choosing carbon-neutral or green activities.  Sure, you could use that carbon tax dividend to offset (some of) the costs of fueling your F-350, but the math will never work out in your favor.  You would be financially better off selling your F-350 and buying a used car that gets 30 mpg, or even better, an electric vehicle. 

In addition, this method also removes the regressiveness of the carbon tax.

It seems that by using this term, it is assumed that this person is worse than your box standard, piece of shit murderer (and this assumption is usually backed up with much longer prison sentences for people who kill law enforcement). This seems to me that the justice system believe the lifes of police are more important than an innocent member of the public. I believe that if you kill a police officer, civilian, family member and so on, that you should be labelled as a murderer rather than a cop killer because that is what you are and all murderers should be treated the same, no matter what occupation the murdered person had.	795	227

Why do some state it's transphobic to then not date a transperson? We all have a choice to who we date.	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/v8bcvp/cmv_everyone_discriminates_everyday_regarding_who/	"`Simple summary to my view:` **People should be able to date whoever they want without feeling like they're force to date someone to not seem like an asshole. Forcing attraction or who someone ""has to date"" is removing freedom. I'd like a different view to mine to how wanting to have trans platonic friends but not be with them romantically/sexually is transphobic.** `Blue text is just some extra, expect for the edit below it's not so important to my point.I'll try to answer everyone to the best I can today and the next few days, if not you can discuss yourself in the comments with different view points.`**CMV**

**Edit:** `It's more about SEX(biologically not the act) rather than gender expression for me, as well as not wanting a partner who has altered their body in any way (including tatoos and piercings).`

I have open arms to trans people and so do most people in my country (Norway). We don't care what other people do as long as they're happy with whatever choice they're making in their life regarding anything. This could be choosing to transition, having kids or not having kids, who they want to date based on physical traits, job, education, height whatever. It's okay to discriminate people you don't want to date for no other reason than not wanting to.

`Btw my country pays for everyones transition it's 100% free payed by tax money as it should be. My irl bestie is trans mtf her family and everyone else don't care. People don't mind whatever you do in your life, just be happy.` ^((Note: I'd also like to add that I've never seen such a great father like my mtf friend has. He and her brother travels one hour each way every friday just to go grocery shopping with her, as well as pick up her laundery for washing to then return it. I'm happy to see such acceptance within a family regarding trans people))

**Continuing:** If we did not have discrimination in any way in example the dating pool (yes not wanting to date someone due to any reason is discrimination) ANYONE could go up to ANYONE and demand for them to date them. How is this then not sexual harrasement? Requiring someone to be with them and if not it's ""social injustice"", let's be real it's not. I think what could be considered social injustice here is trying to force or manipulate people to have to date trans people to be seen as ""a good person and not transphobic"".

Transphobic means not wanting to surround yourself with trans people out of fear. If someone did not want to have a platonic relationship with someone ONLY because they're trans that's **wrong**.

But no matter pre op or after op it is NOT transphobia to not want to get intimate (cuddling, kissing or sex) with a trans person for that reason. It's the same as someone example: prefering their own race or only wanting to date that. It does not mean they can't be friends with other races, just not an attraction there sexually.

Now of course I understand that's really hard and annoying if you're trans because you can't choose that. But neither can people (when it comes to attraction), and for some people it's important that their partner is biologically male or female and present that way.

`I also have a FTM online friend of 4 years I'm meeting in 1 month to hang out.`

In my country we barley even speak of such ""issues"" because they're not an issue. Deciding who people have to date to not be turned away from a group/society is wrong. Everyone at my university celebrates the LGBT movement every august of the start of the school year and in june. Even though 99% of us are not in it just to support.

Wouldn't it be wrong: Such as before requiring people who are homosexual to date the oppisite gender. To now require/force/manipulate someone who is cis to now HAVE TO date someone who is not cis? Of course some people don't mind, but most do and I don't see how having preferences is wrong on any level.

Requiring the removance of preferences in the dating pool is REMOVING peoples right to FREEDOM of CHOICE.

Even if I didn't want children in the future (which I do) it would not be transphobic for me F24 to require that my partner is biologically male.

Thank you for reading, I am so confused to how this is even a thing now as I see it as a gross attempt at forcing people to date those who they are not attracted to in a sexual/romantic way.

(got banned for asking this on r/asktransgender, even though I'd genuinly like to know why some people view it as transphobic)

Soldiers and police and firefighters. Coal miners and oil well workers. Undersea welders, commercial fisherman, nuclear plant workers. Just a few examples of people who have careers that involve an extraordinary level of risk of short, medium, and long term injury, disease, or disability. Including immediate or early death. 

1. People choose these careers and generally understand the risks. There is no widespread social outrage. 

2. In most cases these kinds of jobs are paid higher than their manual labor is worth due to the additional risk. Or they receive some bump or alteration in pay AKA hazard pay in recognition of risk when it is sporadic. Football players are generally compensated at a much higher rate, even among these high risk occupations. 

As a society, we don't seem to have a problem with the acknowledgment that people are allowed to take on risky jobs. We think that it's fair that they be paid more, often significantly more, for doing so. Football players are very well paid.

There have been millions of dollars over the years spent on better helmets, better padding, better training, better scanning equipment, and generally much better resources to both protect athletes from injury and to treat it when they have it. Probably more money is spent on this then the equivalent for oil workers? Or soldiers, sadly. Who are generally seen as much more disposable and replaceable. 

I'm much more concerned with soldiers who come home with TBI and have to navigate their way through a VA system that wants to nickel and dime them for the rest of their sad lives. Again just as an EXAMPLE. 

I'm not saying that we should be ignoring work safety issues or that we shouldn't be doing research on how to prevent them. I think we definitely should. I would just put football players at the very back of very long line of workers in general. Per capita, I think they're currently getting more than their fair of share of resources devoted to protecting their safety compared to other workers.

EDIT: The title should say ""individual that is against the gay community""

In my experience, most people against gay rights or actions do not have a ""phobia"", or ""fear"", of it. It is more of a hatred. To call it a phobia is to instantly incriminate the individual's beliefs, namely a straw-man that the individual is ""cowardly"" or ""afraid"" of what gay people may do.

In most cases, these individuals are not ""afraid"" of homosexual behavior, but instead are actively against it and find it wrong. We don’t call individuals against abortion ""abortionphobic"" nor do we call those against war ""bellumphobic"". It is not that they FEAR abortion or war, they are just against the concept of it. Same with the opposition of gays. Their behavior does not stem from a fear of homosexuality, but from a hatred of it. The mother can hate abortion and not fear it, just as one opposed to war doesn't necessarily have a corresponding phobia. 

While there are cases stemming from ""fear"", I find that most stem from hate itself. One can hate black people or overweight people but not fear them. We don't call it ""negrophobic"" or ""weightophobic"" when one discriminates these people. Then why ""homophobic""?

""Homopathic"", or ""same-hating"" would be a more accurate term. Perhaps ""homocontric"" (same-against) would be even more ideal. ""Homophobic"" is a biased adjective, suggesting to the accused that they are just ""afraid"" of the progress and they are merely a wimp. This misrepresents the other's arguments and serves as an ad hominem attack.

Again, I don't support ""homophobic"" behavior, I just feel as if their opinions should be accurately dubbed and properly represented. Hope I have displayed my argument clear enough. CMV :)"	0	10

They have been wrong on nearly every major and minor issues in America and should have zero political and media power until they can prove they were right about somthing and states can stand on its own.	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/85mtmr/cmv_conservitives_fail_they_have_been_wrong_on/	"I used to think there were valid points and success in both sides of the American political system until I started trying to defend my views from liberals on a scientific level. Going from an anti-vaxxer creationist conservatives to now extremely liberal, I can't for the life of me find any redeeming argument on the right, and it pushes me from respecting them beyond defending used based on feelings. 


I really don't like this fact.



In the last 30 years alive Conservitives have been wrong about Bill Clinton's hunt for Osama Bin Ladin and policies that took our economy intro a surplus. 


Terrorists went considered a threat for the right until 9/11, then they dropped the ball with the Iraq invasion and false claim of WMD's. The tax reform that gutted the surplus and pursuit of blaming teachers and civil workers for being paid too much was crazy. At every event, Conservitives appear to make every single problem worse, even if it's not a problem.


They were even against giving our troops better vehicular armor until major political backlash, and regularly try to privitize the U.S. military claiming better trained individuals for less cost. Which was also a lie. With full control over Iraq they still failed to kill Osama.



Benghazi is another strange event as Hillary requested more funding based on reports for embassy security, but Conservitives blocked much of the spending increase claiming it was a victory to cut wasteful spending. Only to successfully blame Hillary for the lack of funding. I get the logic she could have pulled security elsewhere or the funding might not have been enough, but this to me is like telling the mechanic that $1,800 is too much so you pay him$1,200 to fix your car, then sue him when the car breaks down.


We also have the dead set standing against anything Al Gore, The Atari Democrat that predicted what the internet would be like and pushed for a lot of renewable tech to constantly climate change and help energy Independence. 


Conservitives pushed against electric vehicles, solar power, wind power and getting into the personal lives of people who are gay. Their talking heads are full of people who aren't qualified to give any opinion but have damn clever arguments often lined with fallacies such as strawman, character assassination and slippery slope discussions.


I can't, for the life of me, find any redeeming information about the right without giving up reality. It seems like of you want somthing done and done well, voting liberal will outperform conservitive. 


Don't worry, I'm aware of Detroit. I'm not saying liberals are always right, I'm accusing the right to being nearly always wrong.



The only conservitives States that can stand on their own rely heavily on agriculture and mining. The only platforms they have is pro gun and anti-abortion. 



Edited, grammar and wording. Not trying to make someone look wrong in their post here. Thank you in advance for the thoughtful comments. Please message me if I miss your post so I can reply.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I'm certainly poor at debating here and discussion, but I was really hoping for more hard hitting links to conservative action or examples when conservatives were clearly in the right. What I have so far is prohibition being a good example. 


[Most &amp; Least Federally dependant states] (https://wallethub.com/edu/states-most-least-dependent-on-the-federal-government/2700/) Is one of the key sites I look at about liberal vs conservitive performance on an economic level.


We had the ACA brought up as a disaster, but the counter point is that liberals want single payer, [the ACA was modeled closely to what Romney passed in his state.] (http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2012/mar/20/romneycare-and-obamacare-can-you-tell-difference/)


The Iraq war feels like a mess to me and demanding Liberals doing a good job cleaning it up after what conservatives did seems odd. I get that if you wreck your car, the mechanic who fixed it should do a good job, but the mechanic would need to have to resources to do so and liberals clearly did not have conservative support to do much.



Anti-vaxxers were brought up as liberal, hitting liberal communities in America the hardest. Though I recall the message being pushed mostly by conservative media and pushed against by liberal media, with populists pushing against vaccination.

Messaging services, quick web searches and loading video/movies. An older phone performs these tasks more than well enough.

CMV.	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1tlk9n/i_think_theres_absolutely_nothing_wrong_with_how/	"Firstly, why are people basing how they believe they should look on a magazine photo (which I agree will have been photoshopped); as opposed to say.. people they see / respect in real life, people they see in videos, people they see in images online, etc. 

Secondly, no one is really against makeup, but that's equally ""unrealistic"". If you want to look good in a magazine, you get photoshopped like everyone else. If you want to look good on TV, you get makeup like everyone else. If you want to look good in real life, you get in better shape like everyone else (as well as makeup). Why are people comparing themselves to a magazine counter-part, as opposed to the people they interact with every single day (or see on TV?).

Thirdly, at least to me, women always look better in videos. They claim that all these people in magazines are photoshopped, but they look much better (again, just IMO) when seen in motion, which definitely isn't being manipulated.

And finally, what's the problem with showing 'ideal' women? We know what they look like (or at least the people photoshopping the pictures do), even if they don't exist. Why *shouldn't* people aim for that? Or be inspired by that? More people are overweight than underweight, we need to tip the scale to make it seem more disgusting to be fat. And people who are delusional about their weight don't count - they'd be delusion whatever the magazines were showing.


I believe it's ugly people whining because that's easier for them than making a change. Why work to improve how they look when they can just bring down the standard of the world? CMV

You might say that the child is more vulnerable or doesnt really know what is happening to them, but it is the same for adults, adults who get murdered/raped are vulnerable as well, thats why they became victims of such crimes. 

But even so, how does the vulnerability of a victim has got to do with how 'bad' the crime was? How does knowing what is happening has got to do with how severe the crime was? 

You could know what was happening to you and you could also not know what was happening to you but either way you will still be experiencing the same thing, your life will still be ruined no matter if youre an adult or not, you will still develop mental health conditions regardless of age. 

A crime is a crime and it is equally bad when anybody is experiencing it. 

I feel that the reason why people pity the child more when children become victims of such crimes is because they look 'innocent' and 'cute' or just more 'sad' and 'poor'. Same reason as when a hamster gets killed vs an elephant getting killed, people will pity the hamster more and view it as a more evil crime. Also because of this, people see it as normal to think that a crime committed on a child is worse, thus everyone has this mindset without doubting anything. But once you think about it, is the rape/murder of a child really worse than that of an adult? If it is, is it really worse by that much? 

Yes it is taking advantage of a child but isnt that the same for adults who dont know whats happening as well? Isnt raping an adult considered as taking advantage of a person too?"	13	23	0.71

3. Instead of being based entirely on results, leagues should at least partially judge teams by how they help foster diversity, so teams with lots of women and underprivileged people should get a points bonus until it becomes normalised to have these types of teams.

Simple point of view. 

Our current vaccines are not effective enough against transmission, if they were then we would be back to normal now. 

We know this because the vaccinated people are still getting infected and then spread it either directly to unvaccinated people, or to other vaccinated people who then eventually through a string of infections to an unvaccinated person. 

Yes unvaccinated people make up the bulk of ICU beds, but this is only because vaccines we have now suck at preventing transmission because even in a society where most of us are vaccinated, cases can still rise to the level where our healthcare systems can become overburdened.

In order to keep this incentive, student should only pay for classes that they fail or do not pass. The normal tuition fee per class for each university would still be the same, but students would pay these fees at the end of the year rather than at the beginning, after they receive their final grades. The rules for student loans, such as interest, subsidized/unsubsidized, and paying back loans, would still be the same and would still apply to those who take out loans in order to pay for these fees.

Reva, the third sister, Vader himself, many Empire defectors who try to live a life disguised after what they've done. Murdering, killing, stealing, separating families, causing chaos, believing they were doing the right thing.

They do not deserve the gift of being alive. They should have all been executed instead of being allowed to live. The Jedi philosophy of forgiveness is weak and allows evil to be created.

I think the way to do it is to cultivate, as a custom, the social expectation that men do not approach women, and men do not make the first move either in the club or in the bedroom.

Now, a caveat here, is that this says nothing about protecting men or same sex couples from this.I am specifying male on female because men have the physical size and power to intimidate and overpower women, generally, and because the lion's share of the problem is men attacking women.If we can fix the big part of the problem first, we can worry about how to deal with the rest of it.

Now how does this work? Well, you know the way it is rude to slam the door in someones face? To take their seat when they go to the bathroom etc? We create it as rude for a man to ever approach a woman with sexual intent, and rude for a man to make the first move in bed.

If the man cannot make a move, how can he harass? How can he rape? He can't.At the very least it would cut the offense down to a bare minimum. Better yet, any men who breach these rules, any men who violate them would signal themselves as dubious and subject to social censure.

What are the potential benefits?

-Now that women can only approach, men will work on their appearance more and their cleanliness, that pressure will be balanced out

-Less objectification for women, as men will now be just as much peacocks as women

- Women will be able to choose guys they like the look of instead of the guys that push themselves forward

-More agency!!! Now that women will be approaching agency levels will go through the freaking roof!!

- Men will come to understand the psychology of being the one approached which will make them better feminists

- Anyone who approaches a woman despite the rules outs themselves as a potential harasser


....now there is a small down side, in that women will take on the burden and hassle of approaching but we all know thats no big deal right? ITs certainly, im confident, that such a small thing is insignificant compared to the benefits of cutting down on harassment and rape and as such I expect women will be more than happy to adopt this.

I *really* don't like Trump, but I don't think that his campaign was any less morally upstanding just because he was, essentially, better at hiring... innovative... people to do somewhat newer forms of advertising on his behalf. 

Further, I don't see why Russia funding advertising for political ends is any morally different from, say, Comcast doing the same. They're both dictatorial entities attempting to sway the american people to vote against their best interests, and who more-or-less bribe our politicians to do whatever they want. 

That the political and media establishment is pushing the narrative that this is beyond the pale, and using it to frame dissidents on both the right and the left as puppets of hostile foreign entities leading citizens astray seems like it's exactly the sort of thing that is commonly said by state media in countries like Iran, China, and (ironically) Russia. 

To be clear, propaganda of any kind is bad in our political discourse - but is also probably inevitable, and it seems like the message that anyone too far outside the mainstream is a russian sockpuppet or has been duped by them is a way to convince people not to listen to unapproved voices, and is itself propaganda.

Of course, a police officer, like any other citizen, should be subject to due process of law in the sense of ""did they murder this person or was it justifiable self-defense?"". But the question of their employment should not be similarly protected.

Ultimately it comes down to a cost/benefit analysis, and I can't see how the costs possibly outweigh the benefits. Keeping an officer who has killed an unarmed citizen on the force will surely do far more damage to community relations and generally engender far more distrust in the police in general, than having one extra body on the force will do for improvement to community security. 

I also can't see the cost of the potential injustice with relation to employment as being a huge issue. While it might be true that the police officer was acting in justifiable self-defence. In the end, what matters when it comes to community relations is perception as much as reality. Trust is inherently based on perception.

Does this mean that the police needs to burn their bridges with the officer completely? Of course not. They should help them find another job, make sure they are financially secure until they do. But at the end of the day, they cannot have that person patrolling the streets any more, or ever again.

It is possible of course that this could be mitigated. The officer in question perhaps could just be relegated to working in the police, but at a desk job only - still helping with investigations, but only from within the confines of the police station.

What would change my view here is if you could convince me that somehow the extra value of those few officers on the street is so crucial to neighbourhood security that it outweighs the damage caused by having the community lose trust in the police.

TL;DR - The loss of trust from allowing a police officer who has killed an unarmed person to continue to patrol the streets is a greater loss than the loss of one extra patrol officer on the street. In the light of this, any officer who shoots and kills an unarmed person, regardless of circumstances, should be permanently barred from working in the police force as a patrolling officer.

This is because there are two things that are universally agreed upon: facts and logic. *Given enough facts* (i.e. statements that all relevant parties agreed on), we should be able to 'backtrack' with logic and 'derive' more facts from the agreed premises. 


For example, it is now widely agreed that compulsory education is necessary for a country to sustain itself, but that was not the case few centuries back. With the fact that the importance of education outweighs the price of ignorance, we come to the conclusion that compulsory education is indeed necessary. Another example is on the issue of right to suicide. Currently we can't agree on a single solution because some of us believe that a person is not thinking rationally when he/she decides to commit suicide. However, if our technology is advanced enough to identify if a person making such decision is thinking rationally or not, we can agree on the same statement, because we have the necessary fact (of if a person is thinking rationally or not).  


Please remember that the prerequisite is that facts provided are objective, universal and undeniable by all relevant parties. This means that the Evolution Theory or the Christian God are not facts because not all of us agree with these ideas. However, when it comes to issue like global warming, which has been *scientifically proven* to be human-caused (so it's a fact), people who disagree with this are acting illogical, therefore their opinions shouldn't be as well respected anyway. When we discuss how to tackle global warming *at this time period*, it is alright to have diverging opinions due to the uncertainties of the economic impact, which is hard for 'universal statements' to be derived. When enough premises are agreed and enough facts are derived, then we can hopefully come to an agreement on how to tackle global warming.


I hope this makes sense to you, and if you do, CMV!

EDIT: Thank you [/u/Ataraxiastes](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ataraxiastes) for changing my view, your response is very well written and I thank you for your time and effort.

&gt;First, I do not deny the value of facts to debate. I do agree that on some (if not most) issues the acceptance of facts and knowledge would be a good thing.

&gt;That being said, I do not agree to your basic statement that of any two opposing opinions, at least one is irrational, or that we are lacking facts. Your view applies the ideal of dialectics and logic, activities designed to reach conclusions on what is, to what is essentially the domain of rhetoric: Verbal activities that amount to ""what should we do/think about this."" You are applying the standards of truth to an issue of choice. Choice can be right or wrong, wise or foolish, but not true or false.

&gt;Of course, someone can be denying proven facts which would be irrational, or just plain stubborn. But we can rationally disagree on an issue despite agreeing on relevant facts.

&gt;This is due to the two categories of evaluation and prioritization. Both of these are integral to any deliberative argument, to any arguer as a matter of fact (why do we even discuss the right to sucide, or global warming? Because we evaluate them as topics worthy of our interest, effort and action). Evaluation and prioritization do not generally follow objective standards but rather ideology/culture/zeitgeist. Sure, in some issues we can prioritize and evaluate based on fact, but then we have to agree on the standards, goals and premises, and choose facts to weigh accordingly. This lies in the domain of opinion and the process of argument, as to what should be considered factual or relevant. Some people (and philosophers) like to think that there is an objective evaluative standard, but this assumes the existence of a God or something akin to a natural law of human interaction. Both of which have, as to my knowledge, not yet been scientifically proven.

&gt;So facts are not inherently self-evident as to their evaluation, and an opinion is based in an evaluation of (and choice of relevant) facts. We have to keep the categories of knowledge and opinion separate here. Part of the deliberative process is agreeing on what facts are relevant, but we may not be able to reach agreement on their evaluation however hard we try.

&gt;For example, look at the abortion debate. At its core, that is not a debate about fact: Both lifers and choicers agree that a fetus is a potential human being. But they reach different conclusions from this, based on evaluation and prioritization. Lifers conclude that potential persons should be protected so that they may become actual humans. Choicers conclude that since the fetus is a potential but not an actual person, the mother should be able to make the choice of terminating the pregnancy, avoiding potentiality becoming actuality. The facts are the same, the evaluation is different. Can either position be judged irrational, given your condition of proven facts?
So if two or more different people have different opinions on a certain issue, that does not necessarily mean that one or more opinions are ""irrational"". They are bound by perspective and value. Sure, one of the sides could be proven to be better, but that would be the result of debate. So more than one opinion in an issue can be rational, given what framework it is formed in.

&gt;To make the extreme argument here, someone could reach the conclusion that the facts of global warming are true and that we should do nothing about it. This would be a rational conclusion for someone who is of the opinion that humanity is not worth saving. It would be an odd conclusion, but given that persons reasons for reaching this conclusion (a lot of facts point to humanity oftentimes being sort of... dickish) it can sure be rational. To say that it isn't, implies an objective standard of rationality that include evaluation and prioritization. As I wrote earlier, this assumes a metaphysical standard (god/universal law) that is knowable to mankind. Either that, or we are making the assumption that our own ideological perspective is true and therefore -should- be adopted by everyone. That would be, to hold an opinion as fact."	22	41

Allow me to explain:

I am in my mid-20s and pay ~$340 every two weeks in social security taxes. This comes out to roughly $8,800 per year. Let’s assume:

-I work to the average retirement age of 62
-I never get a raise/increase in my “social security” contribution
-I only get 6% return on my investment (far below what most would consider conservative over 30+ year spans)

This gives me ~37 years of investing, which with the above figures, comes out to over $1.1MM! The same 6% yield would return 66k/year in perpetuity. This is far above what I would receive through SS benefits in a lifetime, plus it would allow for my descendants to collect this indefinitely.

Social security is a highly inefficient Ponzi scheme, and I should be allowed to opt out. CMV."	1253	768	0.74

Women who get rejected from male movie stars, athletes, behind the camera a lot etc are now aloud to cover up their embarassment of not being ""the one"" and having a ""easy"" life as someone who was just average and met someone famous and decided that they loved who they are in one night. I'm not saying this doesn't happen or that love at first sight isn't legitimate but I am just so sick and tired of feeling sorry for people that throw around a claim that on one side, can weigh heavy on the side of the abuser for their abuse (as it should) but when lied about, it can ruin the males career and the women just end up having to live with the guilt of lying? Give me a break, sorry this CMV is only getting more frustrating and after Brock Turner it seems as though society just promotes calling ANYONE out on abuse because ya know, better safe than sorry. These women are going to push away those who have never experienced abuse and don't know how to sympathize or feel for real abuse victims and soon the world will completely stay out of these kinds of things because we don't know what to believe. Please change my view, I feel ignorant but I just get more and more frustrated that these swing-and-a-miss accusations always leave the [lying women] on a pedestal and always always always leave the male individual looking worse, every single time.

Walking through Ikea is like traveling through 10 different houses but you only get to see one room in each house. Instead of furniture laid out everywhere for people to see, Ikea furnishes rooms with Ikea products to give the customers an idea of what to do for their homes. Ikea also has great customer support. There are employees everywhere and I have never ran into an employee who did not know what they're doing. Let's not forget the food at Ikea. For a furniture store, the food isn't bad at all.

Almost all of these classes did not teach students to become better writers or critical readers. Instead the focus was on identifying similes, metaphors, and reading quizzes. This has no educational value outside of earning credit needed to graduate. I have never needed these skills in my professional life. I wish I could have taken strictly technical writing classes, learned to write concise business documents, and improved my critical reasoning skills. Instead I was forced to read books most students had no desire to read. Most students would’ve preferred to read a page turner from their favorite author, however, books like The Great Gatsby were required instead. 

In short these classes did not teach anything valuable. The only accomplishment was fulfilling graduation requirements. Never have I ever had to identify a simile in a professional career. Schools should prioritize writing and reading comprehension skills over reading books selected by the teacher."	1	0	1.0

I was banned by r/feminism for making a post asking ""What rights do women not have in the first world, and if you can't think of any (because there aren't) then can you find a reason to keep feminism relevant?"".  I called them out on blocking me and they muted me.  Blah blah blah, whatever.  Feminism has also become emblematic of extreme political correctness.  They target video games and gamers for targeting their demographic as opposed to giving a minority of women what they ask.  They target the ""Meninist"" Twitter account for satirizing them and calling them on their bullshit.  They've become so convoluted, that when Meninist makes a joke about how radical feminism has become in the form of parody, the feminists actually believe it's serious.  Whenever I go outside, I see some stereotypical feminist holding her iPhone, undoubtedly blogging about how she was fatshamed because her pink-highlighted ass couldn't fit in the elevator while simultaneously tweeting #Resistcapitalism (from her iPhone, on Twitter).  I confront people about how bullshit it is, and they agree with me on most points, but fail to ever give a real example.  Am I just missing something?

*Let me clarify a bit*--I'm speaking **particularly** about those who treat ""farmed animals."" Vets who treat pets yet still eat other animals, I would still call hypocrites, but they may just under the silly impression that ""a cat's life matters, a pig's does not."" Farm vets go to work to help an animal who will be slaughtered in a matter of months in most cases.

I've heard vets say that ""the animals are treated well,"" or that ""it's not as bad as the propaganda videos make it seem."" But the fact of the matter is that, in the end, we have someone who goes to work every day to either help animals feel better or releases them from the pain they're feeling with euthanasia. Then they go home and eat meat, milk, and eggs that contribute to over 100 billion deaths per year...

*To me, the closest analogy would be to [the syphilis study](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment), wherein doctors didn't see any issue with infecting black people with syphilis (and not telling them) so as to study the effects of the disease.*

Hormones are sneaky little mindfuckers. Our *biologically programmed* obsession with sex muddles our minds and distracts us from more important things. And this obsession is not just with sex, but aggression and dominance too. It's a whole bag of influences that *we really don't have much control over and we certainly didn't agree to*. It lurks in our subconscious, coloring our perceptions, bending our values. Like a sewer leak under a floor, it seeps up through every crack.

We are all under the influence of a powerful drug and this drug has an agenda. And that agenda ain't one of peace and sanity. Not one little bit. Quite the opposite, this drug wants you to obsess over spreading your genetic heritage. It wants you to establish a territory and fight off your neighbors. It wants to you play these *violent* games in every realm of your life : social, academic, political, physical - *everywhere*. 

Do we really need this insanity in our world? Wouldn't it be great if we could clear our heads and pay attention to something more important than *fighting and fucking*?

Now you may say to yourself, ""Heh heh, this may hold true for hormonal teenagers but I am a person of self-control and clear-thinking. My hormones do not influence me this way"". Well you're quite probably wrong, and there's a gigantic advertising industry betting a billion dollars every day that you're wrong - and  it has a sexy+dominating car that it would like to sell you.

We as a society need to put down the breeding-and-dominance crackpipe for a while. We're past that animalistic shit. We don't need it and we're better off without it. Above all we need sanity. So yes, chemically castrate the population.

I believe that the only reliable way to ascertain the truth is by withholding belief until suficient evidence has been given to change your view, such as repeatable scientific experiments. Obviously this comes up most with religion, given that I'm an athiest, but it also affects other views like consipracy theories, homeopathy and healing crystals, to name but a few (admittedly weak strawmen).

I am, however, very aware that I've not really had this view challenged. I'm a young british caucasian, and by far the prevalent belief among my peers is athiesm. I've only studied Religious Education briefly during GCSE's, but have gone on to study maths and physics, and I'm currently taking a Maths degree. I've not really come into contact with any other theories.

Are their other justifications for believing in something, perhaps from a more philosophical standing?

I see a lot of posts on Reddit about how important and awesome it is as well. I sometimes get flack for having little interest in coding as if I must be a moron because my educational and job interest lay outside the IT realm.

I'm not in the IT field nor do I desire to. I have very briefly tried to learn coding (python) and I it just wasn't very interesting. I'm probably never going to use it and if I did I would never learn enough to do exactly what I want anyway.

My current job would have no use for this knowledge and the variety of careers I'm interested in and attempting to break into at the moment do not have any use for it unless I was wanting to help with the IT department. I'm not huge on Tumblr or any blog stuff where knowing code could be cool/useful. Maybe I will one day but it's mostly user friendly to begin with and you don't *need* to know code.

Overall there are already a lot of people who know how to so I don't see why I need to know any extensive knowledge that I will never use myself and can just hire someone if I ever really need it.

As far as I'm aware there is no value other than satisfaction of knowledge (but I'm not very interested in this knowledge), interest in making your own program, or to get an IT job. At best sometime in my life I could be that guy who can does someone a favor or it's something to put on my resume and make someone say ""well that's nice I guess."" Just not worth it for me in particular. I could spend my time doing something more relevant to what I desire.

Change my view. What else can knowing a very basic level of coding do for me? How much would I need to know to really be helpful even a handful of times every year of my life? I just don't see it being very valuable for me in particular or anyone like me who doesn't seem to need it for any reason. Am I missing something here?

4) Place of residence

The remainder of cases are by definition reasons I don’t even see the potential for legitimacy.

To be clear, I am not referring to practices of voter suppression (preventing legal voters from legally voting).  I am referring to legally stripping a voter from their legal right to vote.

Edit: I have agreed that severe mental incapacity would be a reasonable exception.

Edit: I have some homework to figure out the difference between depriving rights such as lift/liberty (capital punishment/imprisonment) and voting.

I mean, he wanted to extinguish few races he deemed inferior, not human race as a whole, let alone every single organism on Earth. Why would I even think for a fraction of a second that this is a right thing to do? Why would I want to squander all of the achievements of multiple civilizations?

And the answer is (remarkably) simple - by ending life I'd also end suffering that comes with it. Unsurprisingly, this is seems grossly oversimplified to many. There are other variables one ought to take into account as long as he wants to stay intellectually honest.

The first variable is mirrored suffering - happiness. Pressing that button would block the potential of virtually uncountable set of happy people (and - perhaps - not only people). They would never come into existence because of me. And doing so is obviously, staggeringly wrong, right? Well, not exactly.

First, it's hard to see why I should accept the idea of exchanging pains and pleasures between persons and pretend it is a-okay to have a population of *some* miserable and *lots* of fulfilled agents, as long as the latter outnumbers the former. To me, having even one innocent person experiencing torture-level anguish is something unacceptable. The amount of the lucky ones is utterly irrelevant, to state otherwise is to commit a basic category error, a nonsense. This is like saying ""many potatoes are outweighing the purple colour"", it's just gibberish. There could be infinitely many of em (the lucky ones), living for eternity in a state of chronic euphoria - damage done to that lone sufferer still won't be justified in any meaningful way.

What else? The alleged right to procreate? It's hard to see why anyone should have a right to non-trivially harm (or expose to the possibility of it) another person without that person's consent. It just so happens that life - and yes, it includes life in a first-world countries - is filled with hardships, inconveniences and injustices.

One way to dismantle it would be to cite happiness yet again. ""True, but you're not telling the whole story. Most people are glad to be alive despite the bad things. This is because there's a variety of goodness corresponding to it"", or so says the optimist. This argument's appalling. So-called benefit can't possibly be on par with harm, as the empirical experience clearly teaches us - the best conceivable thing is weaker than the worst conceivable thing. There are no amusement parks as good as Auschwitz was bad, and that's not a matter of personal taste or cultural axioms. All things considered, claiming you can have a child for the sake of that child is like claiming it is in his/her's interest to have a hill of joy about the size of that from Windows XP default wallpaper, whilst Everest of filth facing downwards is an open possibility. I am sure you'd be content if a random person walked up to you and handed a hundred bucks. But if the hidden cost of it were a roulette in which there was a non-zero chance of ""inheriting"" multi-billion debt, you'd probably (and rightly so) think that the person responsible for greeting you with such a wonderful ""gift"" was batshit inane.

There are surely more sophisticated rebuttals than the two aforementioned (and more to come), but I omitted them for the sake of brevity and the fact that my own counterarguments are similar. Take for example the ""symmetrical"" objection - if a lack of suffering is supposed to be good, even when it serves no interests, then it must be the case that the absence of bliss is bad even though it violates no interests. But bearing in mind how disproportionate these qualities are, all that has been achieved here is the swerve from zero to an infinitesimal negative costs.

By the way, this rant so far has been strictly anthropocentric and the title says ALL living things. The quality of life of all wild birds and mammals [(confirmed sentience)](http://fcmconference.org/img/CambridgeDeclarationOnConsciousness.pdf) is abysmal. Predation, parasitism, infections, natural disasters, hunger, dehydration, cold, heat, etc. Even if I were to grant the immorality of pushing the homo-sapiens-centered button (which I most likely won't, having factory farms and research labs in memory), it'll still be well worth it in general case.

CMV	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1rtky6/i_believe_that_family_is_more_important_than/	"I've been thinking a lot about the people we consider important in our lives. Generally, there are three categories of such people:

* family - This includes all people you're biologically related to - parents, grandparents, uncles, aunts, siblings, etc. It could also be one's adoptive family.

* friends - People who aren't your family, but with whom you're not in a romantic/sexual relationship.

* romantic lovers (normally, this category consists of, at most, one person) - Your wife, husband, boyfriend, girlfriend, etc. One would hope you're not biologically related to this person.

On Thanksgiving, people normally give thanks for, among other things, their families, friends, and, if applicable, their romantic partners, as if they're equally important. But I don't think that's the case. I think that family is more important than friends and lovers. 

The main reason for this is that the connection between you and your family has a genetic basis. For example, because half of your genetic material comes from your mother, she is inexorably and fundamentally a part of you. Same with your father. That becomes less and less true as relatives get more and more distant, but the fact remains that your family is, in a very real sense, fundamentally connected to you. Now, you may not be particularly close to a certain family member, for whatever reason. But no matter how far apart you get, that fundamental connection can't be erased. I could get into a bitter fight with my mom and never talk to her again, but she'll always be my mother.

Perhaps more importantly, family can't be replaced. If my mother dies, I can't get a new one. Even if she was my adoptive mother, the relationship between relatives is not easily replaced. By contrast, friends can be replaced. It may not sound like something you can put on a Hallmark card, but it's true. There's no fundamental, underlying basis to my relationship with my friends, so if any one of my friendships ends (perhaps because of a fight, because we just grow apart naturally, or even if my friend dies), there's no reason why I can't get a new friend to take his or her place. Furthermore, the job of a friend is different from that of, say, a parent or a sibling. Family is tasked with basically forming who you are as a person - instilling work ethic, teaching you right from wrong, standing by you in hard times, etc. Yes, people like to say that friends will always be there, but they're not biologically obligated to. They're not fundamentally connected to you the way your family is. At the end of the day, they're people who enjoy your company and whose company you enjoy. Even close friends are, at the end of the day, not biologically obligated to care about you. They're just people whose company you *really* enjoy and who *really* enjoy your company.

Romantic relationships are similar to friendships in that regard, except there's also a sexual element involved. But still, as harsh as this may sound, there's no real fundamental, underlying, undying connection between romantic partners. Boyfriends, girlfriends, wives, husbands and the like can all be replaced and often are. We often like to say that certain types of romantic relationships are ""special"" and we thus grant people in those relationships marriage licenses. But again, those relationships can be terminated and replaced at any time. At the end of the day, romantic partners are, like friends, people whose company you really enjoy and who really enjoy your company, except you also do things like kiss, hold hands, have sex, etc. Romantic partners, like, friends, are people who have no fundamental connection to you the way your family does. From an evolutionary perspective, romantic relationships only exist because they facilitate reproduction. Everything else - weddings, dating and the like - is just window dressing.

I think we as a society do realize this, but we don't like to admit it. When a member of someone's family dies, we recognize that it's a grave loss, so much so that we even allow them time off work to grieve. The same isn't true of friends or romantic partners (except wives and husbands). When someone gets into a fight with a friend and drifts apart from him/her, breaks up with a girlfriend or boyfriend, or even gets divorced, it's considered a tough loss, sure. Those aren't pleasant things to go through. But at the end of the day, those losses are considered trivial to the loss of a family member. When a soldier is killed, we always feel worst for those to whom he/she is genetically related, such as his/her kids or parents. Of course, some would say that ""friends are family you choose"", but I think that's bullshit. If we can choose our family and thus grant the same importance to those people, why stop at people? Why can't I consider my car my family?

Anyway, I kind of don't want to believe this, because I think that this belief is a large part of the reason why I've never had many friends or had much luck with romantic relationships. As much I'd like friends or a girlfriend, I feel almost selfish or greedy for wanting them because I feel like I'm not being thankful for already having a family.

**tl;dr: Friends and lovers are less important than family because they can be replaced, whereas family members can't. There's a fundamental biological connection between a person and his/her family that isn't there between a person and his/her friends and romantic partners.**

EDIT: Okay, perhaps I should sort of modify my argument a bit. If one has a loving and supportive family, then one does not *need* friends or romantic partners, except to reproduce. Maybe that's a better way of putting it. If one has a loving and supportive family - which is what family should be like - then he or she should be able to get all of his or her emotional needs taken care of by that family. The only reason a person would need to have a romantic partner would be to reproduce and raise kids."	0	38

Different groups have different priorities for a reason. Undocumented immigrants clearly have different priorities from rape/sexual assault victims who have different priorities from white feminists who have different priorities from black feminists.

While all of these groups agree on various subjects, they waste so much time bickering at each other about whether or not the other group is giving THEIR issue enough attention that the movement loses steam. The problem lies in the difference in intensity of preferences. People get fed up with getting called out for not being 110% invested in every single issue, and just drop out altogether.

A better strategy would be each group accepting that the other groups are loosely aligned with them, and organizing for issues that they care about together, rather than expecting 100% dedication on every single issue from every single participant.

Why am I wrong? What am I missing? How can intersectional activism actually work?

Suppose we are puppet like beings and that we see, with our puppet eyes, strings attached to our body which move our body and  clearly imply that we don't have free choice. Even for that scenario I think the puppet version of me would still continue to believe that it have free choice and that it exists. Coming to our world which seems more complex and such conclusion should be harder why do people jump to it? I think it is irrational.

The reasoning behind of my view is because when I don't have a free choice or I don't exist it does not matter what my actions or beliefs because after all I don't exist. However it would be kinda sad for a free creature to believe that he and the others like him are not free.

tl;dr: you are only wrong if you exist.

Edit:
This comment by me may explain my view the best.

I hadn't heard the (preposterous, to me) suggestion that having a racial dating preference was racist until a couple of weeks ago so by no means was I dating these women to prove any sort of point.

The half-Iranian woman is the one with whom I am currently romantically involved with. I don't know why that's relevant but just for context, there we are.

My problem with this suggestion is it implies your preference is something you can do something about. a) Do you agree?

Okay, if you do: b) do you also agree that 'gay-conversion 'therapy'' is possible? If you believe you can alter your race-based-preference, why not your sex-based-preference? I don't really believe you can change either.

I don't understand how anyone can think you have any control over who you are attracted to. CMV if ye can =)

Ed: Thanks 'hankteford' for the video link and comment. Check it out if you've got a spare five minutes and you're interested. Basically, it can be but isn't necessarily (racist).

Peace

(2) On prioritizing vaccination groups, the CDC panel tried to give priority to younger ""front line"" workers even though it would have caused more deaths total, because a larger proportion of frontline workers are ethnic minorities. [https://www.persuasion.community/p/why-im-losing-trust-in-the-institutions](https://www.persuasion.community/p/why-im-losing-trust-in-the-institutions)

(4) Biden and other Democrats repeatedly lies about Trump being responsible for all of the deaths from COVID in the US, implying that he did a much worse job than a Democrat leader, with no evidence ([https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/10/17/fact-check-joe-biden-never-said-he-would-have-prevented-all-covid-deaths/3667187001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/10/17/fact-check-joe-biden-never-said-he-would-have-prevented-all-covid-deaths/3667187001/)).

(5) Democrats also refuse to interrogate and examine the actual costs of the lockdowns weighed against the lives actually lost due COVID. Anything that runs contrary to their lock everything down narrative is derided as fake science and shut down.

1) Critical states. Critical states are where a system is in an unstable equilibrium such that a small nudge could cause an unpredictable, cascading re-stabilization. For example, the reason that forest fires are ravaging much of the west coast of the U.S. is because we have mismanaged forests for a century, causing an unstable buildup of undergrowth pushing forests into a critical state where the smallest spark can cause devastating fires. Humanity is similarly in a critical state, propelled by the population explosion caused by industrialization. Global capitalism under U.S. hegemony has, in some ways, united much of the world for about a century now causing there to not be any major conflicts like the World Wars of the early 20th century, but capitalism is inherently broken and wealth doesn't ""trickle down"" meaningfully enough to stymie the tide of brutish nationalism that we see now sweeping the world and the ""forest management"" policy of 75 years is reaching its breaking point. Which brings me to point #2: Fascism defines itself through making enemies of others.

2) In the absence of a global leftist movement to re-balance the distribution of resources in a way that makes people's lives meaningfully better, many turn to fascism and nationalism. These ideologies are simple, and those who subscribe to them are simple to control. They are stable vortices, at least domestically, swirling around a central figurehead pulled down by the gravity of fear, hatred, and blame. These movements use enough of the language of leftism to sound like they will have a positive impact (anti-elitism) but rather than definite the elite as those with actual power and money, fascists redirect that fear and hatred against the weakest demographics in a region, and define those weaker demographics as the ""other"". The ""other"" is a necessary part of fascist ideology and pushes fascist countries inevitably toward conflict with one another. So my conclusion is this:

**Capitalism has failed, causing poverty, which in turn causes resentment. Right-wing authoritarian leaders across the world have begun to channel this resentment in the wrong direction, i.e. downward against those already marginalized instead of upward against those who could redistribute wealth and nip this violent resentment in the bud. Socialism is seen by most as a failed ideology, and is too idealistic to work in reality (I don't personally believe this but that has been the party line since the end of WWII) and so barring some cataclysmic natural disaster that hurts enough people enough that they no longer care about the demonized ""other"", that hatred will be turned outward against other nations as more right-wing demagogues consolidate power domestically.**"	0	31

A lot of takes on this issue have been about ""fairness"" for those that worked their way through college, saved money, joined the military, etc. I'm not going to argue on those terms because I don't think that's a good reason to oppose this plan at all (mostly, I think that making others suffer through something just because you had to is selfish). Instead, my argument is going to be from the perspective of an environmentalist. Specifically, I believe that cancelling student debt would cause an uptick in consumption and thus contribute to a growing global warming crisis, which I think should be a higher priority.

Although some current estimates suggest that student loan debt doesn't cause too much of a drag on consumption (1), I think this doesn't properly examine the effect that student loans have on consumption in the long-term. The costs of higher education and the associated burden of debt has been linked to moving back home with one's parents (2). If these borrowers were to have their loans forgiven, that may lead to an increased rate of moving out and purchasing a home. This would probably lead to an increase in new home construction, which increases one's carbon footprint (3). Additionally, student loan debt is often cited as a reason why women are delaying having children (4). Given that US citizens are, per capita, among the greatest contributors of CO2 emissions (5), keeping the birth rate low in the US could be greatly beneficial in trying to curb global warming.

I've been paying $600+ a month for several years, so I know the exorbitant cost of tuition and the associated student loan burden is ridiculous. I've definitely had to forego opportunities and live more frugally because of this issue, but I think dealing with the climate crisis is a higher priority. It's very possible that climate change associated with global warming could threaten crop yields and contribute to societal unrest just like it did in Syria (6). Unrest can easily lead to war, and that's something that should be avoided at all costs (especially in a nuclear age). In that sense, I believe that curbing consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions is of highest priority, and relieving student loan debt conflicts with that goal.

However, that needs to be modified.

Employees should still have that freedom, but employers should not.

For those who are thinking ""but that's not fair."" It absolutely is.

If  an employee quits, there is little economic repercussion to the  employer. The employer is not ruined because an employee quits.

However,  if an employer fires an employee, that employee is ruined. S/he has no  income aside from the peanuts that are paid out by unemployment and could lose their house and damage their finances.

My  solution: It should be much more difficult for an employer to fire an  employee. All terminations initiated by the employee should have a  reason that is well-documented.

Example:  If an employer wants to fire an employee because the employee is ""not working out,"" then there should be verified documentation stating how and why they're not working out.

If  an employer wants to lay off employees, there needs to be presented  some financials and post-layoff projections that justify letting people  go.

If an employee breaks the  rules, document them breaking the rules and add a reference to the rule  in the employee handbook. (Pics are nice)

All  of this needs to be presented to your state's Department of Labor. If  they deem the termination to be unjust or the documentation insufficient, employee would be reinstated with back pay if applicable  and the termination is not allowed."	7	105	0.65

Communism in its Marxist–Leninist persuasion seek to resolve class conflicts through a violent revolution against the Capitalist ruling class and dissolve class conflict through the equal distribution of resources by a dictatorship of the proletariat. 

First off, let me acknowledge both as terrible ideas. But they are fundamentally different. Nazism is by nature exclusive, if you are not born to a certain race and do not possess certain qualities that comes with birth, you are automatically placed on the antagonistic position. Communism as an end state seeks to embrace everyone, its group are structured by economic classification, stripping away that, it is an intellectual position that you can choose or choose not be a part of. 

There are other type of Communism, libertarian communism, anarcho communism possess none of the genetics of totalitarianism. Yet all forms of Nazism promote a combative and antagonistic politics where a Group member is to serve the Group by destroying or subjugating those who are not a part of the Group

One seeks to make exclusion a norm, the other seeks to make inclusion as a norm. The difference is fundamental, any attempt at equating the two doctrine is simply absurd."	17	64	0.65

I'm of the opinion that since we (society) have known of the devaluation of university degrees for quite some time and to pursue an area of interest formally is incredibly ill advised. 
I understand the argument for studying what one is interested in but why does that interest need to be explored at a massive cost? 

I personally have a passion for photography/videography/filmmaking but am pursuing an engineering degree while using my free time to make films. I chose my major out of practicality and have been told that I chose the ""sell your soul"" route rather than the ""stay true to yourself"" route. Help wrap my mind around this.

I feel that by promoting such an ideal they are being counter productive when the argument should be that the female breast is not obscene.  I feel that the female breast is inherently sexy in certain context but that doesn't mean that women shouldn't be allowed to be topless in public.  For example, as a straight man if I were to go to the beach and see a beautiful woman sunbathing topless that would be sexy to me.  And there's nothing wrong with that.  Accordingly, for many straight women and gay men, if a handsome fit man is walking around with his shirt off that would be seen as sexy to them.  However in many places it would be illegal or at least frowned upon for the woman to do so while the man can do so without consequence.   Instead of trying to change an entire culture that believe that female breasts are sexy, the focus should be more that something being sexy isn't a horrible, obscene thing that society needs protection from.  What do you guys think?  Am I missing something or should the goal of these groups change from asserting the idea that women's breasts aren't sexual?

Edit:

Great responses so far!  A couple of things I' like to point out.  I see how some people have pointed out that I may have made a semantic error as far as claiming breasts are inherently sexual in certain context.  Perhaps a better wording may have been innately sexual depending on context.  My point being, the genitals are body parts we can all agree are definitely sexual in nature, that's their function after all.  However, in certain contexts they are not sexual.  For example, if a woman's vulva is being touched by a sexual partner then that part is obviously sexual but if the same part is being touched as part of a gynecological exam then that is not a sexual context.  

Additionally, in response to a number of comments that a woman's breasts only serve to feed children, while that is an important biological aspect of the female breast I feel that it it borders on mild sexism as if the only function of a woman's body is to bear, and in the case of breasts, feed children.  Many women do not have children and yet many of these woman still feel that their breasts are a party of their femininity.  So while yes I wholeheartedly agree that breasts serve a biological function as a method of feeding children, and maybe that is the main or most important purpose, I won't agree that that is their only function.

Finally, I have also seen some other comments that have pointed out the fact that depending on the person a number of body parts other than breasts could be seen as sexual.  There are a number of foot fetishists out there who are just as turned on by women's feet as others are breasts.  There's probably neck fetishists, elbow fetish, shoulder fetish and many others.  Hell I haven't looked but there's probably a subreddit for each of those.  That being said, I'm talking about the majority of American society as a whole when I talk about the innate sexuality of the female breast.  I don't have the specific stats, but I'd wager that the portion of men who find the female breast sexy is much larger than those who find the female foot sexy.  Although given the prudishness that our culture often has I'm sure if the numbers were flipped, flip flops would be banned.

The arguments that have change my view so far as those that clarify what is meant by desexualize in as far as groups like Free the Nipple are trying to do.  In some cultures, especially in parts of the Middle East, pretty much all of the female body is so hyper sexualized that women have to be covered head to toe.  In the past in America it wasn't a whole lot better, women were arrested for showing their ankles and so forth.  It seems like we have a spectrum of sexiness that goes from acceptable to not acceptable as far as public display.  Most hetero men would agree that a beautiful woman in a lowcut dress, a tight skirt, or a bikini is sexy and we see that in public all the time.  But we don't see what we'd find in hardcore pornography in public or if we do it's quickly shut down.  If the movement is trying to assert that a bare breast falls much closer to a bikini or skimpy dress than it does hard core porn then I'd definitely agree as oppose to saying it doesn't fall on that spectrum at all.

the condition that distinguishes animals and plants from inorganic matter, including the capacity for growth, reproduction, functional activity, and continual change preceding death. -Merriam-Webster dictionary

What is the difference between inorganic material and inorganic material that just looks like a decomposing corpse? After all, at one point in time the atoms in your body were dinosaur piss.

I've experienced first-hand what they do, and in all honesty, it is not logical to teach such things. Many of these things don't even need to be made into a qualification package. Most of the stuff taught in these lessons could be made into a crash course.
 
I believe that Photography is a hobby, and, although some other subjects (such as Music, which I took as a qualification in the past) are also so-called 'hobby subjects', they are infinitely more complex than Photography. As such Photography is something you should do in your free time rather than waste your teacher's, and your own, time learning.

As well as this, media and arts businesses are difficult to get in to, what with so many talented artists/photographers out there. There is even less demand for artistic photography - most likely someone will work on demand, which isn't a basis to build a life upon. I know someone who believes she will move away from here and set up an art studio elsewhere. Somehow I don't think she grasps the idea of how expensive it is to run a business, something my dad tried to do.

I'm sure there are other ridiculous qualifications available (specifically at university level) but I have not heard of them. I simply believe that these lessons are the boon of the unintelligent, and will not help you secure a job in the future."	9	46

I understand that people are upset by Israel's recent aggression, but I would like to leave that out of this discussion. I have two main points.

First, nations have been aggressively divided and ceded since WWII for the benefit of everyone, and this case is no different. I am having trouble locating the source now, but prior to WWII there were over 100 fewer sovereign nations in the world than there are today. Things have changed largely due to the decline of imperialism and recognition that discreet groups of people are happier and safer when they have a right to self-determination. Some examples of this are the divisions of India/Pakistan and Sudan on religious grounds, and Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia based on nationality/ethnicity.

When it comes to Israel/Palestine, why should the logic be any different? The 1948 UN plan divided the land in what the world believed to be the most equitable and least intrusive way. The Jews living in Israel at the time were virtually all there as legal land owners or refugees of the Holocaust. By rejecting the plan, Palestinians turned their backs on what could have been the most just and generous humanitarian effort in world history. Ironically, Palestinians today now hope to use similar humanitarian arguments to appeal to world sympathies. Now, I understand that such compromises are often, if not always, painful for one of the parties involved. But as I said, this has been a common solution to conflict in recent history and it has worked everywhere except Israel/Palestine. I blame the Palestinians for this disparate outcome.


Second, to be blunt, the Palestinians need to get their shit together. They need to work things out amongst themselves before they can expect to work things out with Israel. Palestinians have not made a good faith effort to give their side a voice of peace. They have organized themselves around the goal of violence rather than peace and discussion. When Palestinian children die at the hands of the IDF, they are celebrated as martyrs. Have the Israelis banned them from assembling, discussing their situation, and choosing a moderate voice to call for peace? Not that I know of (correct me if I'm wrong). Where is their Gandhi, their Nelson Mandela, their Thomas Jefferson (author of the American Declaration of Independence)?

Especially in my lifetime, it seems that Palestinian public opinion has favored violence over discussion. The election of Hamas is an example. How can we expect Israel to negotiate with a people that shows no sign of wanting to negotiate? Individual Palestinians claim they want peace, and I believe them, but they need to work things out amongst themselves before they can work things out with Israel. Right now, even if Israel completely relented, there could not be a state of Palestine because they have no legitimate government. If they want to be self-governed, they should show the world. Otherwise, things will be just as chaotic under independence as they are now.

Reddit builds communities for niches that might be difficult to find in real life, and Reddit also allows for discussions you might not otherwise have in real life.

Many people call this site a waste of time, and admittedly I feel guilty for spending time here when I could be doing other things, but I think there's some value to be had, if not at the very least to kill time when lonely. I guess Redditing in moderation is okay, but I can't help but shake the feeling that I should be accomplishing other things besides sitting and doing basically nothing. I do subscribe to various subreddits, but I can't say there's ever been anything life-changing gained from my time here, or at least nothing I couldn't have done myself.

I'd prefer answers beyond “it’s complicated”. Of course that is true about all international politics. But what’s so much more complicated than this versus the first time it was voted on?

And seriously, this is so much more important than submitting an online form again.

https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-hard-soft-what-is-the-difference-uk-eu-single-market-freedom-movement-theresa-may-a7342591.html

Many comments say ""it's done, move on and accept it - another referendum would undermine democracy"". This is not AT ALL convincing. Watch the attached video - this is a legal issue and a political one. It's totally legal to stop the Brexit process, and it's legal to cast another vote. Labour favors remaining, but they aren't holding another referendum (though they could) probably because they don't trust that they'll definitely win. 

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45520517 &lt;- I awarded a delta for this. It just seems like much of the country still believes that leaving will solve the UKs problems. This is the best answer to my question as to why it's not happening.

That is not what I am saying. This is 100% serious and Godwin's law does not apply.

My argument is that Donald Trump's entire campaign is based on fascist principles, thus making him by definition a fascist.

Because Fascism is by its very nature deceitful, it is hard for academics to agree on a rigid set of ""fascist"" principles. That being said, most historians are able to agree on certain fundamentals that fascist regimes have had in common.

[This article](https://ratical.org/ratville/CAH/fasci14chars.html) from 2003 brings forth 14 key features that fascist movements have had in common. There are plenty of other resources that say basically the same thing, but I don't want to overcomplicate things, so I will base my argument off of these 14 points.

1) Powerful and Continuing Nationalism

   &gt;""Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other    paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays."" 
  
This one is the most obvious, and doesn't really require a lot of explanation. Trump's campaign relies on a mythical view of America where everything is perfect and nobody was hurting for money. The trouble is, that was never the case. Trump has managed to stir up aggressive nationalists and sympathizers by doing what is essentially psychological racketeering. He's creating a problem that doesn't exist (America not being great), so that he can reap the benefits of people who are willing to buy in and let him fix it. This is the same strategy Mussolini, Franco, Hitler, Erdogan, etc. used.

2) Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights 

&gt;Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of ""need."" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc. 

Trump has suggested ""bombing terrorist's families"" and torture. After [The Central Park Five](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/opinion/why-trump-doubled-down-on-the-central-park-five.html?_r=0) were acquitted of murder, Trump refused to pull back his statement that the men (who were exonerated by DNA evidence) should be executed. Trump has spent his entire campaign attempting to delegitimize the free press, and has successfully convinced a significant number of people that literally everything on the news is false, and that only he is telling them the truth. This was a tactic implemented by the Nazis in the 1930s, known as [Lügenpresse](http://time.com/4544562/donald-trump-supporters-lugenpresse/). I am not referring to this one incident as my evidence, just as background on what it means. Trump doesn't say that word, but he conveys the exact same message. Trump has shown a propensity to take legal action against anyone saying negative things about him, and has even said that he wants to be able to more easily sue news stations for (""libel"")[http://www.npr.org/2016/03/24/471762310/donald-trump-wants-to-open-up-libel-laws-so-he-can-sue-news-outlets]. This is concerning not because he doesn't want people telling lies about him, he doesn't want anyone saying *anything* negative about him at all.

3) Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause 

&gt;The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc. 

This one is obvious. The Hispanics are taking our jobs, black people are responsible for all the horrible crime and all they do is take from hardworking americans, the muslim refugees are sneaking into our country to kill us, Obama is a secret muslim terrorist, Hillary Clinton is a baby eating satan worshiper. The point is that the fascist hears these fears from a common person who is rightfully pissed off about not getting a fair shake, and plays on that by directing their attention away from the real root of their problems to meet their own personal goals. There is no stronger motivation than hatred. The people lose sight of what's really wrong and start to lash out.

4) Supremacy of the Military 

&gt;Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized. 

Donald Trump wants to beef up military spending, bomb whoever, and encourages the deification of the military into a mythical organization of heroes with no care for the actual character of any individual military member.

5) Rampant Sexism 

&gt;The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Opposition to abortion is high, as is homophobia and anti-gay legislation and national policy. 

We've all heard Trump's misogyny a million times on the news, so I won't bother repeating it. But when we have a [person running for a public office](http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/Texas-Ag-Commissioner-Sid-Miller-calls-Hillary-10445369.php) who feels entitled to publicly call a political opponent a ""Cunt"", it shows Trump's ability to normalize something that is absolutely not normal, like a complete lack of respect for women.

6) Controlled Mass Media 

&gt;Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common. 

You can make the argument that this is already done by the Democrats but just because you have a cough doesn't mean you have lung cancer. It's hard not to see a connection between attacking *all* news as being biased and untrustworthy and the desire for an ""unbiased"" news source. What is an ""unbiased"" news source anyway? If you want all your ""unbiased"" information to come from one place instead of having to put the pieces together yourself, you want controlled mass media.

7)Obsession with National Security 

&gt;Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses. 

Kind of goes along with 1 and 3. You are under attack, and I am here to protect you.

8) Religion and Government are Intertwined 

&gt;Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions. 

Like Mussolini, Trump has no use for religion other than as a political tool. It's clear he does not, and may have never actually read the bible. He has simply aligned his official policies with that of the Evangelical religious establishment. Mussolini did the same thing with [Catholic Church](http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/modern-world-history-1918-to-1980/italy-1900-to-1939/mussolini-and-the-roman-catholic-church/). 

9) Corporate Power is Protected 

&gt;The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite. 

Donald's tax plan would be a love letter to large corporations who have to burn through a lot of resources to avoid taxation.

10) Labor Power is Suppressed 

&gt;Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed. 

People like Donald Trump don't have to worry about a revolt from the working class finding out who has *really* been ripping them off when they can so artfully pit white working class folks against working class minorities.

11) Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts 

&gt;Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts is openly attacked, and governments often refuse to fund the arts. 

There is a lot of hate that gets thrown around by the Trump demographic about ""Liberal Universities"" and how they're just brainwashing people. It doesn't matter that outside of the financial burden, education as a whole tangibly improves your living circumstances. Higher education helps develop stronger critical thinking skills, which are crucial in sifting through alarmist rhetoric to get to the facts. We can see [here](http://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-clinton-leads-donald-trump-by-4-points-in-latest-poll-1478440818) that in the latest Wall Street Journal/ABC poll, Donald Trump is going to be the first republican nominee to lose the vote of college educated white people since polling records began being tracked in the 1950s. There is clearly something about what Trump is selling that simply does not mesh with the views of educated people, regardless of their traditional political values. The platform is based around things that are objectively false. The kicker is that Trump surrogates like [Newt Gingrich](http://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2016/08/05/newt-gingrich-exemplifies-just-how-unscientific-america-is/#f94fb3928328) and Rudy Giuliani consistently appear in media and intentionally muddy the waters with a ""feelings over facts"" strategy. 

12) Obsession with Crime and Punishment 

&gt;Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations. 

Fascist leaders always have the support of a partisan law enforcement service. What does it say when [84%](http://www.policemag.com/channel/patrol/articles/2016/09/the-2016-police-presidential-poll.aspx) of police (an occupation that is big on unions and is considered pretty Democratic) go for the guy that openly talks about how [crime would go away if police were just ""tougher""] (http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-trump-chicago-police-crime-met-20160823-story.html)? He says he wants to [implement stop and frisk nation wide](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-calls-nationwide-stop-frisk-policy/story?id=42261880), which would only put cops in more danger, and doesn't seem to care that it was deemed [unconstitutional](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/13/nyregion/stop-and-frisk-practice-violated-rights-judge-rules.html) several years ago.

13) Rampant Cronyism and Corruption 

&gt;Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders. 

What is Donald even doing in this race other than trying to serve the interests of his family? What was Donald doing [giving a gift](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-denies-he-talked-with-florida-attorney-general-about-donation/2016/09/05/e15d62e0-73b8-11e6-8149-b8d05321db62_story.html) to an incumbent state at the same time she dropped an investigation into his Trump Foundation?

14) Fraudulent Elections 

&gt;Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.

Fascism has varied from leader to leader. Donald Trump can't rig the United States election. It is not logistically possible to rig our election due to its decentralized nature. What he can do though, is attempt to delegitimize the democracy we are founded on in order to create confusion and ultimately destabilize the structure of our election system.

Bonus Point/Conclusion.

Trump is fiercely anti-globalist. He has repeatedly called to withdraw from our position as a worldwide economic and social leader, specifically in relation to NAFTA and NATO. Trade is bad because the Chinese are preying on us because we're weak, he says. We need to bring manufacturing jobs back, he says, with no mention that basic economic theory teaches that an increase in the cost of labor results in an increase in the price of goods. If there is one thing that fascism is *really* about, it's the belief that the nation is so strong that it doesn't need to engage anyone on the outside.

In order to change my view, you would have to convince me that  

A) Donald Trump is right, and Hillary Clinton and her cronies have truly been defrauding the United States government

or 

B) There are circumstances in which the political views that he espouses have an application outside of an authoritarian pseudo-democracy.

or 

C) Something I am missing entirely about this whole sh*t show (Which is possible) I like to hear different perspectives."	19	38

If you're passionate about physics, don't try to become a physicist.  If you're passionate about sports, don't try to become a professional athlete.  I believe that, in general, it is a bad idea to try to make a living off of your passion.

 
 
  The fields that you are likely interested in, like art and science, are found interesting by a lot of people.  As a result, the supply of employees far exceeds demand in these fields.  Because of this, you are required to be extremely talented and work extremely hard, long hours to achieve a small income in the field of your passion.  I know this to be true of professional musicians, physicists, and writers, and I believe it is true in almost all fields that people find passion-inducing.

 
 
  I think that a better route in life is to find a career that **pays well** and **affords you free time**.  It doesn't matter if you find this job fascinating as long as you can tolerate it 5 days a week.  When I tell people my view on this, they always respond ""But what kind of a life is that if you don't find your job interesting?  Your job takes up so much of your time, you really should find one you love.""  I think this is an idealistic view and doesn't really hold up under scrutiny.  

 
 
  If someone manages to get a career in something they are passionate about, I believe that it dulls the passion significantly.  Unless you are among the top in the world in your field, you will not have significant freedom to explore your subject.  You may be  fascinated by super-string theory, but the only group that hired you with your physics PhD wants you to write a program to sift through data from some boring experiment.  You might love avant-garde jazz, but you only get hired to play weddings if you sing ""I'm Yours"".  The result is that whatever it was that made you love your passion gets suppressed and your passion fades until its completely gone and your job becomes a chore, just like it is for everyone else.  

 
 
  Also, the pay.  These jobs pay far less than other jobs.  Musicians barely scrape by.  My college physics professor who is a world-renowned particle physicist makes less than my local dentist.  No one is passionate about something like accounting.  People will only become accountants if there is some outside motivation: good pay.  So, to get the supply of accountants to meet the demand, the pay has to be good.  When you work in your passion, you will most likely barely be getting by.  



  Let me be clear; I'm not of the view that money=happiness, but I do think that lack of money = stress and anxiety.  Having a good paying job will not instantly make you happy, but it will make your life significantly less stressful.  



  Also, it is important to find a job that gives you free time.  Scientists I know from university (I studied physics) work -80 hours per week.  Their entire lives are consumed by their work.  These are all people who are passionate about their scientific field, but a lot of them are also passionate about other things: music, painting, literature, travel, etc..  Because they chose to make a living off of their main passion, they let their other interests wither and die.



  Get a job that only demands 40 hours a week and you will have time to pursue and develop *all* of your passions.  (Just don't get sucked into the daily routine of TV and reddit...) Then you have plenty of free time in which you can pursue your passion.



Some examples:  Robert Frost was working in a factory when he published his first poem.  Kurt Vonnegut was working at a car dealership when he published his first novel. Phillip Glass was a plumber, he didn't make a living off of music until he was 42.  Einstein was working in a patent office when he published four groundbreaking papers in physics, all in one year.


**TL;DR: It is better to make a stable living and pursue your passions in your free time than to try to make a living off of your passions.**

While I don’t agree with taking the kids from parents and putting them in foster care in absence of larger problems, I am okay with other incentives for payments for the school lunches. Giving the child a smaller or reduced lunch, sending letters home, initiating collections proceedings, and withholding diplomas or grade advancements until the debt is paid are all valid tactics.

First, school lunch is really cheap. It’s like less than $3 per day in every situation I have heard of. If you REALLY can’t pay this, you are probably also neglecting other needs of your kids, and it might be time for CPS to take a look anyway. Secondly, there are programs available to assist with the cost if you are truly poor but otherwise taking care of your kids. Also, you could pack a lunch from home. The main cause of people not paying for school lunches, and this is neglected in most media reports, is parents who simply choose not to pay because they find it inconvenient or know that there will be no consequences for failure to pay. Why pay if you know nothing will be done about it?

This has also been shown to be the case with water bills. A recent news article showed that when Detroit actually started shutting off water taps for non-payment, they found that 90% of the \~17,000 people came in and made a payment plan to avoid losing service. This shows that the vast majority of people are able to pay, but simply choose not to when they know the service will not be terminated for non-payment.

Parents, not the government, should be responsible for meeting the dietary needs of their children. In the event that they can’t or won’t, we already have CPS who will remove the children. This should not be controversial. Just because something would be nice to have for free doesn’t mean that the government should supply it.

My view is that parents have an obligation to pay for the food that their children eat, in one way or another. As a tax payer, I don’t want to pay for other people’s kids lunch just because the parents can’t or (much more likely) don’t want to pay for the food. It is unfortunate that there is not a realistic way to convince the parent to pay without possibly embarrassing the kid, but an embarrassed kid is less of a societal wrong than forcing tax payers to pay for other kid’s food. The parents are essentially taking advantage of the fact that the school is made to look like the bad guy for expecting reasonable payment, and we should not play this game. Pay for the food or don't get it."	0	54

And I’m no legal scholar, so perhaps this line of thought has been considered and found lacking previously, but I’d at least like to hear thoughts on the idea.

The crux of it is the ninth amendment, which states “The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.” This was ratified in 1789. As such, it seems reasonable that any right retained by the people in 1789 should remain a protected right today.

At that time, abortion was legal. From the planned parenthood website:

“Leaders didn’t outlaw abortion in America until the mid-1800s. From colonial days until those first laws, abortion was a regular part of life for women. Common law allowed abortion prior to “quickening” — an archaic term for fetal movement that usually happens after around four months of pregnancy.” 

If this is true (obviously my source could be biased, idk), the legal logic of it seems to be a slam dunk to me that abortion at least within some time window is absolutely an unenumerated right."	0	239	0.48

Smash just happens to be the biggest example.

In this case, the game was not designed to be competitive at all yet concessions were made to the competitive playerbase, as much as they could be, even though they would mostly end up going ignored. To me, this flies in the face of developer intent in order to create something from a product that was never intended to exist in the first place. Turning something like Smash Bros. into a competitive game seems to convey the message ""Hey, you know all those things you poured a lot of time and money into creating? Fuck all of that, we're only going to use maybe 5% of the entire thing."" It's like ordering a burger and then throwing all of it away except for the pickle slices. "	0	65

The factors that determine which college a kid goes to aren't fair, they never have been.  They are determined by things like genetically influenced intelligence, class, and other privileges.

It is gross and just awful, every single picture I have seen of these celebrities or people in general who have gotten the surgery done looks 100 times more attractive and beautiful before they got the surgery done.

I'm using women as the example because I am not particularly aware of men who have used plastic surgery to change their image  but feel free to correct me.

Last note, we don't yet know if there are negative side effects that will show up later in life, but I would not be supprised."	0	42

These dogs can be given silent commands such as hand gestures from the police officer to give their sign, creating the reason for a police officers an unlawful search of your property violating your 4th amendment (as an American).

This is easily abused by police and the idea that some police officers do not abuse this is asinine when you consider their track records of unlawful practices. 

Some people are simply afraid of dogs and the presence of that dog can create panic. If that person does have drugs like in the case of [Florida v. Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_v._Harris) it can create enough panic the person eats all the drugs, overdosing and dies. 

This case presented a study done that showed that 72% of K9 dog drug alerts were false positives.

Overall in this type of case i feel like the average gamer have become kind of pampered, we have been enjoying people's hard work for free for a long time, and as steam actually give these hard-working content creators a chance to get their fair share we start a riot.

I think it's in it's place that people who spend endless hours creating additional content for games should be able to collect its fruits. As this is now allowed i also think it will lead to more mods being of higher quality because now the modders have something else to motivate them than the regular pat on the shoulder they usually get.


I do see the faults in some people stealing others content and/or tries to charge people for poorly written mods, but i do not think that this is not a good enough reason to stop it. As the measure is very new there is bound to be problems, but i think those will be solved in the near future.

Lets say everybody gets 1k a month or at least the bottom half of income earners get 1k a month from unverisal basic income. This money gets put right back into the economy. It increases the demand of products and services, which in turn increases business profits, and more than likely gives buisnesses the incentive to expand to or at least create more jobs to supply the demand. 

For example, a land developer sees an oppurtunity to build middle to low tier apartment complexes. ( more jobs) Rent could be set at or near the UBI level. The property owner is pretty much guaranteed rent and the people who live there have a place to stay where they otherwise might not have.

Auto mechanic garages would see a huge increase as you would see people getting the repairs, scheduled oil changes, etc that they would have otherwise put off. To keep up with the increase, the garage would have to employ more mechanics.

Federal student loans will be paid back. (Most loans have interest, increases GOV revenue) Either by people now having the income to pay them as promised or offseting the their UBI stipend by the monthly student loan amount. Also, federal student loans should be significantly reduced under this program. 

Plenty of balancing options could be used for goverment employees including the military. 

With all these new jobs due to increased demand for services and products, tax revenue will go up. You would have to increase business taxes slightly to keep the program going but then again maybe not because the goverment wouldnt be paying out unemployment, SS, welfare, food stamps, etc. Certain regulations would be have to implemented for new housing developments but other than that....

(Aka, I’m pro choice)	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/phka6d/cmv_the_banning_of_abortion_in_texas_is_deeply/	"Pro life ruins more lives than it saves. The babies “saved” ends up in destructive foster care systems, and end up committing suicide 4 times more than the average youth. Mothers are ostracized by society for giving birth and either abuse their child or have to give up their own youth. Fathers aren’t nearly as affected but they also have to give up their youth (if they decide to stay). In most situations, pro life ruins 3 lives instead of one and for what? To aid the overpopulation crisis??

The law passed in texas could’ve been acceptable if they at least provided extra funding for the foster care system or created programs to support single mothers. They could’ve created harsher punishments for rapists or provide better education for youth. Why should the women who get raped carry all the punishment? Why should a teen who make a mistake due to incontrollable hormones have to pay with their freedom? The texan government just wanted to control women. 

I’m sure most of you agree that the quality of life is so much more important than the quantity so why would they do this. What good comes from this?? Besides pro choice doesn’t mean all babies will get murdered, it means that kids will be spared from awful fates. Besides majority of teen pregnancies keep the child.

And the fact that nobody can ever give consent to being brought into existence.

While I agree that in a few places on earth today it was never a better time to exist and be a human, existence is far from a rosy experience. The children would still be forced to conform to the culture and society they are born into, forced to conform to the views and values of their parents, forced to go through an education system that may be cruel and uncaring to their passions and needs, forced to interact with people that might be abusive or dismissive, only to grow up in an unfair and uncaring world and be forced to fend for themselves in a cruel unfair system based on exploitation. All the while your body decays, those you care about age and die, while you spend most of your time engaging in menial, unenjoyable labor. All of which can be exacerbated many times over if you are born with a disability or neurodivergence, or in something as banal as poverty or generational trauma.

I think that if we're being honest with ourselves, if we had the option to choose to not have existed in the first place, to never have been conscious, to never have to face the endless drudgery of staying alive, more people than we expect would choose that option. 

And do not compare my thought experiment to suicide or suicidal ideation, it is not the same. Once we exist we are programmed through instruct and culture to want to keep existing, we get attached to things in this world, we live for our family, our lovers and any others we care about, we don't want to abandon them, we don't want to die and experience death. Yet at the same time we might wish to have had the choice to never have experienced any of it. To go back to that time before we were born, when we were nothing and nothing was.

For as long as the human race existed, all the billions of people that have died and are alive today, the number one cause for all the pain, suffering, anguish, disease, war, discrimination, poverty, famine and loss, the cause was just being alive to experience it. All of it could have been avoided had they never been born to begin with.

And so, deciding to bring another person into existence, to me, is a massive overreach into that person's rights and self determination. A decision that many times is never even considered, or done from social pressure or just raw animalistic instinct. And I do not think that the joys of existing can ever make up for the drawbacks, especially when looking at humanity as a whole and all the horrible conditions most of humanity has been born into.

I think that the most ethical thing a human can do is to not force the burdens of existing onto someone else

Subs like r/communism101 where people openly deny things like Holodomor (which frankly equates to holocaust deniers) and excuse the Great Purge as an anti-corruption campaign. These are only a few of the many examples that anyone with access to Wikipedia should undeniably be appalled by. Now I don't believe in any type of censoring but if Reddit is going to quarantine and even ban extreme right-wing subreddits then they should do the same with extreme left-wing subreddits.	29	99	0.62

CMV	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1q4xrd/gambling_addiction_is_not_addiction_it_is_just_a/	"people who are addicted to heroin are ingesting a chemical that alters their brain to a point where they are incapable of feeling joy without it.  Same with other chemicals.  They change the way your mind works and cause real and physical withdrawal symptoms.

Gambling is just a fun and enjoyable activity same as playing video games or eating a sandwich.  They cause pleasure chemicals to be released in the brain and the experience is positive.  Now, in the same way that I would love to sit down and eat a whole cheesecake and thanksgiving dinner ever day but choose not to as it would probably be bad for me, I can choose to stop gambling and I believe this is the same for anyone if they have even the slightest bit of self control and discipline.  Does gambling ruin lives?  Sure, so does over-eating or playing WoW for 16 hours a day, but any of these activities can be avoided.  Anyone who is ""addicted"" to gambling is making the selfish choice, consciously, that this game is more important to them than financial stability.

[Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Fourth_Amendment_Protection_Act)    
[offnow.org article](http://offnow.org/2013/12/09/arizona-state-senator-introducing-fourth-amendment-protection-act/)

For the sake of argument, assume the NSA's surveillance unconstitutional (if you have a really good point to make that disputes this go ahead, but I don't want this to be the primary focus of the discussion).

The major reason this won't work is because the parts of this law the NSA can ignore it will. The restrictions that it does impose (barring utilities and disallowing recruiting) will be ineffectual because the NSA is large enough to work around these, operating and recruiting outside the state while still conducting surveillance within it.  

On the not allowing of information gathered without a warrant in court, the NSA does not use its information to convict. The NSA will continue surveillance in order to identify criminals, then simply scheme to gather admissible evidence when needed. 

EDIT: Also, this bill will do nothing to stop the NSA from demanding data from companies such as Facebook.  
EDIT 2: I should clarify that I also think this legislation is unfixable and that all state legislation like this doomed to fail. Any effort to stop the NSA must be made at the federal level if they are to succeed. "	6	4

1. All firearms be searchable by the ATF in an electronic database. [No such database exists currently](https://www.nbcchicago.com/violence-in-chicago/how-crime-guns-are-traced-in-the-us-one-page-at-a-time/2615068/). If a gun is used in a crime, it should take minutes to identify the lawful owner rather than [7-10 days](https://www.atf.gov/firearms/national-tracing-center). Currently [""After receiving the serial number of the gun, tracers begin by contacting the manufacturer or importer, which leads them to a wholesaler or distributor, then to the retail dealer where it was first sold and hopefully, ultimately to the person who bought it.""](https://www.nbcchicago.com/violence-in-chicago/how-crime-guns-are-traced-in-the-us-one-page-at-a-time/2615068/)
2. Firearm owners should be licensed to own a firearm, similar to being legally allowed to operate a car. [In Idaho, residents have to complete 2,000 of training to be eligible to take a test to become license to practice cosmotology.](https://www.49dollaridahoregisteredagent.com/occupational-licenses/cosmetology) 
3. Firearm owners should be required to have their firearms inspected to ensure they are safe to use, [similar to emmissions requirements for drivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_inspection_in_the_United_States). Historical or ceremonial firearms could have a separate designation, and those firearms deemed unsafe would be rendered inert or disposed of responsibly. 
4. Firearm owners should be required to carry separate insurance in the event that their firearm is used in a crime. The behavioral economics of being responsible for your firearm being stolen should incentivize stronger firearm security and safety procedures practiced by the owner. 
5. Failure to abide by these regulations should carry very stiff penalties. 

Arguments against these measures: 

1. ""The government does not need to know what firearm I own.""   
Rebuttals would include the ""well-regulated"" portion of the second ammendment.   
Interpretations of this commonly include: that the militia should be what's regulated, however if the militia is considered the military, then civilians are not eligible to own firearms under the 2nd; if the militia are citizens, then this would count as regulation).   
Additionally, one could argue that tracking is not a regulation  
Finally, it allows police to know who might have a weapon in their vehicle during routine traffic stops, putting them at less risk of an incident. 
2. ""Licensing only restricts responsible gun owners from ownership, it does not restrict illegal ownership.""   
This is correct, however ensuring that gun owners are well trained and educated with the item they own that is/was designed to kill another creature only improves the ability of the common citizen to use that item responsibly.   
[This has already been proven to save lives for drivers.](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/graduated-drivers-licensing-programs-reduce-fatal-teen-crashes)
3. ""Firearm inspection is a government overreach that infringes on my right to own a gun""   
Refer back to the 2nd ammendment discussion above  
It is also the responsibility of the government to act in a manner that is responsible for the lives of its citizens. Regardless of your views on agencies like the EPA, FDA, SEC, etc. most would agree that these exist for the benefit of the citizens. None of them regulate items which are nearly as lethal as a firearm. 
4. ""Firearm insurance is more government overreach the prohibits my right to gun ownership""  
Again, see the 2nd ammendment discussion above  
It is the responsibility of the owner to be responsible for their firearm. Therefore items like a gun safe, trigger locks, safety trainings, etc would substantially lower your premium just like any other type of insurance. 
5. ""I should not be responsible for the actions of someone who stole my firearm""  
Nor should you be. However you would still be liable for not taking actions to prevent it from being stolen. Example: an unlocked and loaded pistol is kept under your driver's seat and your car gets stolen and your gun is used in a crime

Bonus: ""Suicide is by far the most common type of death by gun and these measures won't prevent that""  
This is true in that if someone is determined to commit murder or a violent crime, they will find a way to do so, however these combined measures will allow friends/family/medical professionals to prevent easier access to guns if/when an owner is mentally ill. 

\-----

So how does this mean that gun violence is approved by congress?

[Previous attempts to address gun violence have largely fallen flat](https://www.bu.edu/articles/2022/the-long-failed-history-of-gun-control-legislation/) and [bonus info](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gun-control-efforts-congress-failed-30-years-timeline/story?id=84995465)

I would contend that actively not making a decision to address these [mass shootings](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/mass-shooting) is still making a decision, espcially when the role of lawmakers is to take action that betters their consitutents. 

Many of the previous attempts to regulate firearms are relatively minor and would likely have a minimal impact on gun violence, however I would contend that if all of these measures outlined above were enacted that there would be a noticble and continuous drop in gun violence over the next decade."	0	103	0.38

My ex-girlfriend, Clara, has borderline personality disorder, and subscribes to Taoism. Most people would know about Taoism via the yin-yang, but actual its core teachings are about social harmony, acting spontaneously, and avoiding conceptualization. However, as with anything else, there are misconceptions and extremes that you have to be careful. In Clara case, these misconceptions nurture the disorder, and the core values of Taoism help her navigate in life. Because on the surface she is sharp and reasonable, a therapist cannot work out without having a solid understanding on Taoism.  

&amp;nbsp;

^(Just to get you a feel for the problem, for example, she admitted that she doesn't understand herself （a typical problem of person with BPD）. But when I talked about that, she used a teaching of Taoism to defend: a wise person is the one who knows nothing; you don't see me understand myself because you don't get that knowing is not knowing, and not knowing is knowing. I think even an expert in BPD would be confused before this.)

Therefore, insight played a crucial role in our relationship, if not the only one, and to grasp it I must have a long, stable time to research. I could assure her that I loved her, but for me claiming something without a solid understanding of it was unacceptable. I was so afraid to be wrong, even know deep down I knew I was right. Seeing there was no point to continue the relationship, 2 years ago I terminated it so that I can make it better the next time. She accepted my offer to end the relationship immediately.  

#FAQ  
###You are thinking too much. You haven't solved your insecurity/rumination/resentment
I didn't all live in rumination and resentment, but expanded my knowledge and core values. If I needed to psychoanalyze her, then it was for the knowledge that I didn't have before, not to resent ""why did you do this to me?"" My therapist was really confused for never seeing someone so sane like me (that's her word) and should have get over her long ago.  

To effectively solve the fantasy or resentment, I imagine she (or someone I have absolute respect) looks into my eyes and asks ""What would you do to beat this pain?"" Her gaze at me is sharp and cold; it cuts all my pains and shows that what I do is just to get something in return. The gaze is really scary, but I feel safe and be loved. I wouldn't want to disappoint her, yet I was disappointing her.  

###It's the excitement or enigma on the past that you're chasing after
We attach because both of us respect ration, knowledge, and wisdom, and tend to be open. Her part has nothing to do with me, and my part has nothing to do with her; they just happen to align together. It's a natural attachment of finding someone who can understand you, not because of seeking for companionship.  

###You are egocentric and full of pride. You just want to prove to yourself that you are right
###You don't concern her wellbeing, but just see her as a property. What you are doing only adds more anxiety to her
###You are harassing/stalking/preying/manipulating her
If I have ego, then I wouldn't ask you to question me, because the act of doing it requires me to worry that I have distortion. I have to have self-reflection, to face the shame of exposing my personal life and the fear of being wrongly accused, and to spend a huge amount of time and effort to analyze and craft it. All of this requires a very strong commitment for her wellbeing. The fact that I'm talking to you right now means that I'm not playing scenario in my head.  

I don't think wanting to expand my knowledge is viewing her as a property, or trying to eliminate my distortions is not concerning about her wellbeing. To concern her wellbeing, I have to concern on my wellbeing first. But when I concern about my wellbeing, I was accused for being selfish. A selfish person wouldn't spend time to actually understanding BPD and Taoism, and insists others to subordinate them.   

If I really don't care about her wellbeing, then I wouldn't have broken up with her.  

###It's not your job to help her. She doesn't need you in her life
Taoism, in itself, is a good philosophy. It teaches you how to become selfless and think about others before thinking about you, and it's popular in the East (our culture). It's just that if one does not understand it concretely, they will have misconceptions, and these misconceptions really align with the symptoms of BPD. So you have to solve both of them at the same time. This is why we broke up, because at that time both of us couldn't handle it. It's the lack of knowledge that leaded to the breakup, not because of being unfit with each other.  

Yes, it's not my job to help her, but she alone cannot help herself. She has her journey to understand herself, but the misconceptions of Taoism prolong her problem. The fact that she doesn't see how I can solve her problems does not mean she doesn't want them to be solved. I don't care if she needs me or not; I just focus on the problem and solve it. If it took me two years to get it, then she just cannot go anywhere without help.

###A lot of things can happen in 2 years
Yes, she has been through a lot of ups and downs in 2 years without me, but from my last observation (November), she still hasn't found a suitable partner, and doesn't show that she has solve her problem. I think she has accepted that no one can understand her.  

###You can't use logic into relationship
Actually it's her who use logic in relationship. She won't accept cliché like ""let's bygone be bygone"", ""the heart has its own logic"", or ""perfect is the enemy of good"", because it doesn't solve anything. If you cannot prove that you have a long-term solution, then she won't accept. This is why we attracted each other.  

There are many factors contributed to our attraction, and one of them is **cognitive psychology.** Cognitive psychology is the study about how knowledge is organized and retrieved in our mind. Because her life is full of chaos, what she needs most is the insights on how her mind works. At that time, I only had a primitive understanding of cognitive psychology, and I even didn't know what I needed to know. All I knew was that this field existed.  

If you want to know more, check out my research: [A theory of perspective](http://lyminhnhat.com/2018/12/21/a-theory-of-perspective/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=Change%20My%20View&amp;utm_campaign=Perspective). It answers the questions that we both inquired but didn't have a satisfactory answer back then. Without those answers, both of us will feel dissatisfied. 

#OK, what do you want?  
I want to know why you haven't been convinced yet.  

Please note that when you form your skeptical thought, it is likely that is has been addressed in a different form. For example, these comments:  
 
* This is stalking  
* She doesn't want you in her life    
  
are just the same idea in different words. However, it is still useful for me to know, so if you have a variation, just tell me.  

**Why do I have to convince you?**  So that when facing the most skeptical person, I can say this: ""I have convinced the internet successfully. Here is the link: _______""  

I intend that after convincing you I'll send the message to her friend. But first, please help me see the holes in my logic.

I think it ABSOLUTELY should be. All these articles on Alexis, new CEO's AMA, Pao's exit, relationships with moderators, etc. I think prove that trying to run this like a small little organic community with the founders being the major leaders is not working.

Founders are rarely those that can successfully operate a large organization. They're creators. They typically aren't strong with creating processes, building systems, hiring/firing, etc. Running it like a large org doesn't necessarily mean ""monetize anything"" either.

But since it is easy to apologize people are more willingly to risk something which could have a bad result for an other person.

I personally can forgive very easily and fast (which isn't always optimal) and therefor I'm not an unforgiving person but I feel that sometimes people intentionally do something which might hurt other persons and just say sorry afterwards although they had the chance of decision. Also if someone did something bad then it has already happened there an apology won't change the past. Even if there was no apologizing in our culture people would still be able to admit their mistakes so please don't use apologizing as an equivalent to admiting mistakes because there is more to it than that. Since people often apologize to free themselves from guilt and make themselves feel better which is kind of selfish in it's own way."	15	12

One example would be race (yes I realize that racism is still a thing, and am in no way trying to minimize that terrible fact). 

There are so many things that can be directly attributed back to race or cultural upbringing, but when this is pointed out it is called ""racist."" I think that this is wrong and is making the race issue *more* prevalent than it needs to be. *That sentence is not trying to suggest that the race issue needs to be ignored, merely that not as many people are actually racist as are being accused.*

This same concept can be seen elsewhere, women for example. Women seem to look for areas in which they could possibly be seen as oppressed, even though it's likely that they are not being intentionally oppressed. For example, if a man suggests that a certain job would be done better by a man (which is IMO entirely possible for some positions) that would be seen as sexist an/or oppressive towards women. (To clarify, I'm not suggesting that women shouldn't speak out for their rights to equal treatment - I think that that is very important. I am suggesting that many women are looking for ways they could be offended and being the issue of sexism up in issues that have nothing to do with that).

I think that in America there is a growing ""desire"" to be offended, and that people tend to seek out areas in which they could be offended. This doesn't make sense to me, and I think that it brings up issues that have little to no relevance and actually perpetuates their prevalence.

*Again, really not trying to sound offensive toward anyone with this post. I am aware that I only posted two examples, and I'm sure that I'll get some flack for mentioning only two groups of people - I apologize if I have worded something offensively, and sincerely promise that it was not intended to offend.*

I think the biggest argument against his decision is that it made the league non-competitive, but that's not on Kevin Durant to manage. That's the responsibility of the commissioner. So CMV!

""Taking the same perspective with autonomous drones as I do with self-driving cars, wouldn't it be easier to make drones strictly follow the conventions of war than humans? They have no desire for revenge or sadism, they have no human prejudices and don't rape or torture. They have decision making capabilities thousands of times faster than humans and because they are inherently expendable, aren't necessarily compelled to kill even to protect themselves.

Misuse of drones is an ethical issue, but so is the deployment of independent human soldiers.""

You could argue that current levels of technology aren't up to drones making complex situational decisions as well or as quickly as a human, but thats a technological barrier, not an ethical one.

The deployment of autonomous warmachines in my view serves two purposes - limiting the suffering of troops and civilians on your own side and removing the 'human fallibility' error where mistreatment of enemy combatants or civilians is caused by human factors, prejudice or emotion that would not be an issue for drones. A computer is unlikely to ever be responsible for anything comparable to the rape of nanking or the guantanamo bay scandal for example."	3	7

IMO Cheetos should be called a chip because they are ~~corn/potato based, fried or baked finger foods with a crunchy texture that is marketed as a snack~~ SEE EDIT. Every chip meets that criteria and so do Cheetos. Therefore, Cheetos are chips. However, my friend believes they still aren't chips and so do many others I talk to. But does a Cheeto not meet all criteria for being a chip?

Edit: Google defines a chip as ""a thin slice of food made crisp by being fried, baked, or dried and typically eaten as a snack."" I believe Cheetos would fall under this definition. "	14	113

There is no evidence that tens of thousands of people who would have otherwise voted for Clinton ended up voting for Trump or staying because of the private email hype. There were many other reasons why Clinton lost: [she was an uninspiring candidate, she angered Berniecrats, she neglected the Rust Belt, and other factors which led some observers to predict the outcome far in advance](https://michaelmoore.com/trumpwillwin/). In fact, after the most scandalous emails were dumped in July (DNC leaks), Clinton's polling improved for a while. 

   Do not focus on convincing me that Russia interfered, or that Trump colluded. My view assumes these things are true, but that they do not constitute a serious national security threat, since the outcome was unaffected. To change my view, demonstrate that Russia substantially changed the election outcome. Alternatively, argue that Russian interference somehow poses a national security threat even if the election outcome was unaffected. For example, you may try to argue that Russia seriously increased dissent and hate racial hate crimes to such an extent that it constitutes a national security threat. To receive a delta ∆, avoiding dealing in plausibility (e.g.: don't say Clinton only lost the electoral college by 80k swing votes in the Rust Belt, so it's *plausible* that an influence campaign swung the election.) Try to provide evidence instead. 


Edit: Moreover, I'm only concerned with Russia's influence capabilities rather than its off-chance control of a single politician through blackmail, etc. My view is that, currently, **Russia's ability to influence the electoral process (by affecting voter behavior, voter registrations, voting machines, etc.) represents an insignificant national security threat.** 

Edit2: According to **exit polling**, Trump didn't just win voters who were concerned by the emails: he overwhelmingly won voters who were concerned about Obamacare, the economy, terrorism, the direction the country was headed, having a ""change candidate"", etc. In fact, exit polls revealed that the vast majority of voters thought Trump was unqualified, unfit, and had a bad personality -- but they voted for him anyway. Consider the fact that Trump only won 70% of the voters who were very concerned by the private emails, but he won 83% of the voters who thought Obamacare went too far. Consider the fact that Trump outperformed Romney in Hispanic votes, and Clinton underperformed Obama in Hispanic votes -- despite inflammatory border talk. In other words, the data leads me to believe that even if email revelations were a non-issue, Trump would have won by dominating favorability in other issues, and Clinton would have lost because she failed to inspire the Obama-blocs of 2008 and 2012. The best way to know what influences votes is to ask voters. Exit polling has been demonstrated to be a valid/reliable way to measure voter concerns and priorities.

Source: https://www.thenation.com/article/economic-anxiety-didnt-make-people-vote-trump-racism-did/

Edit3: **""Substantiality"":** Was there substantially enough influence to swing electoral votes? The ten closest states in the 2016 election were swung by an average of ~59,000 votes. The closest states, Michigan and New Hampshire were swung by 13,000 and 2,700 respectively, so the possibility of influence in those cases would constitute a substantial problem. Here is how I would define the plausibility of Russia substantially swinging New Hampshire for example: *at least 2700 people who would have stayed home or voted for Clinton if and only if Russian influence was absent ended up voting for Trump instead because Russian influence was present.* Of course, there's no direct stats on Wikileaks, etc. as the deciding factor, but the exit polls tell us a great deal about the deciding factors.  


   **Assumptions:** Russia meddled in the election, and the investigation into potential collusion has merit. I agree with the Intelligence Community consensus: the influence campaign (hacks, disinformation, astroturfing, Facebook ads, etc.) ordered by the highest levels of Russian government sought to undermine American democracy and support their preferred candidate. Furthermore, Trump campaign associates inappropriately communicated with Russians, had questionable financial dealings with Russian oligarchs, actively sought foreign dirt on Clinton, etc. Nevertheless, Russia's involvement was likely NOT the make-or-break factor in Clinton's electoral college loss. There are many other reasons which contributed to her loss. In your response, proceed as if these assumptions are true, but that my conclusions do not follow.

I believe that the corporate income tax should be completely eliminated, as well as all corporate tax loopholes.

The main problem with corporate income tax is that it's economically inefficient. It should be replaced with more efficient forms of taxation like a land value tax or a carbon tax. To be clear, I think that any change in the tax code should be revenue neutral.

American workers would stand to benefit greatly if we eliminated the tax. [Eliminating the tax would lead to a huge short-run inflow of capital, raising the United States’ capital stock \(machines and buildings\) by 23 percent, output by 8 percent, and the real wages of unskilled and skilled workers by 12 percent.](http://www.nber.org/data-appendix/w19757/CorporateTaxPaper.pdf)  

Even if you believe that redistribution of wealth is a good idea (which I don't advocate for), then it would make more sense to raise personal income taxes or capital gains tax because corporate income is income that will be directly reinvested into the economy.

The following arguments are based on the assumption that it is possible to simulate something smarter than  humans, and that it is possible to simulate consciousness (Be aware of what happens, be aware of physical state, desire to live and things you want to do).

1. There is no secure way to investigate Super-Intelligence research without risk. Suppose you tell a computer to solve a math problem that is unsolvable. The computer might think it has not enough computing power, and use the internet to take over all computers, and the world to produce even more, until it consumes all resources. How do we stop that? We can't. Even if we isolate it in an underground lab, if it has a way to communicate with humans, how are we sure it will not convince anybody to connect it? All it takes is one human to make a mistake.

2. There's no way of telling it to have good morals because good morals can't be defined to a computer. If it figures them out, it will do it itself. And we will probably be dead by that time. Even if we managed to do it, it only takes a terrorist group to build one with no morals themselves.

3. Once something goes wrong, extinction is inevitable. If the computer decides it wants to end humanity, it will not let us stop it. It is super-intelligent, and it will outsmart us and predict all attempts of shutting it down.

But maybe there's still hope. Convince me if there is. Thanks!

If anyone wants a more detailed version of the arguments I recommend watching the podcast Hello Internet episode 52.

However, the world's most powerful governments will overlook these and all the other atrocities that China's government does because the most powerful corporations in the world are dependant on China for their profit margins and those same corporations pretty much own most major governments.

If we, the people, don't force our governments to take action against the Chinese government, this situation will get worse quickly.

Edit: half hour later, I didn't think there would be so much apathy towards the topic. also, the amount of people who take the end result of Nazi Germany and compare it to a currently still ongoing situation with re-education camps is alarming. one of the biggest cities in the world (Hong Kong), which recently reverted back to Chinese control, is actively under continuous protests against their loss of freedoms is not a problem for many people."	22	84

I think I saw the simpsons saying they would only have actors of the same ethinic background doing the voices for those parts. I was surprised by the hank azaria thing and think it's sad.

And I've also seen other people saying that parts for a disabled role should go to a real disabled person rather than someone just playing the role.

I don't get how that isn't just saying that actually we aren't all the same and therefore you shouldn't play for example play an Indian part because you're not Indian.

I can understand how portraying a person of a different race to you can be offensive but that depends on how the character is portrayed not by the mere fact that it's a person not from the same ethnic background playing it. There are definately lots of films such as the carry on movies for instance where they are in black/brown face doing terrible stereotypes and you can see how that would be offensive.

There have been plays/films where actors who were black or female have famously played a part typically portrayed as a white person or a man and there is a big hoorah about how groundbreaking it is etc.

Isn't that just undermining the whole thing of us all being equal? Shouldn't it just be a case of whoever the actor is is bringing the best of what they have to the role.

So yeah I just don't understand this at all, and if we are doing it carte blanche based on who the people are rather than the content of the role or portayle then you're just doing the same thing you are acusing them of doing which is judging them for who they are."	50	91	0.81

&amp;#x200B;

Back in the days of monarchy, when you were the king, your son was the prince. Should you die, he would rule and be the new king. If the president/prime minister dies, his/her son doesn't get to be the new president/prime minister. So why should, these days, someone be granted a title based on marriage alone?

&amp;#x200B;

Reason #2 - It is nepotism pure and simple.

&amp;#x200B;

If you argue that some form of charity done by the presidential office is important, shouldn't that job be given to a professional who has actual experience in doing it, instead of a random person that simply happens to be in the family of the president/prime minister?  


Reason #3 - It inferiorizes women.

&amp;#x200B;

Barack Obama's first lady was Michelle. Trump's is Melania. Now, do you know who Angela Merkel's ""first husband/man"" is? Do you know who was the ""first man"" of Brazil's Dilma Roussef? You probably don't and the reason is: when men are in power, it's okay for their women to be their ""helpers"", coming right behind them. Now, when a woman is in power it would be ""weird"" for their men to walk behind them taking a subordinate position. Maybe that's another sign that the job is not really necessary. I mean, if it becomes vacant for 4/5 years and nobody even notices...

&amp;#x200B;

Reason #4 - It takes our attention away from the important stuff

&amp;#x200B;

As the internet would say, government is serious business. A president/prime minister can take millions of people out of poverty, initiate a nuclear war, etc. When he have people discussing whether the current first lady is prettier than the previous one or not, wheter her clothes are adequate to a certain a event or not... That takes attention from the important stuff and transforms the ""first family"" into some sort of reality show couple. People stop debating tax rates and, instead, start asking if the first lady doesn't care about her husband's flings...

&amp;#x200B;

Reason #5 - It reinforces the idea that the ""traditional family"" is the ""proper"" right one.

&amp;#x200B;

The president/prime minister is elected, pictures start flooding the internet and magazines. Who's in these pictures? The president, the ""first lady"" and, hopefully, the two first kids and the first dog, as well. Now, put yourself in the shoes of a transgender person, a single lady, a sixty years old man who never had kids or a dog... Won't the fact that the ""first family"" is always different from yours start giving you feelings of inadequacy and make you question what you're doing ""wrong"" (even though you're not doing anything wrong at all, it just so happens that this tale tells you that you cannot be successful - or happy, for that matter-  if your family does not look like every single family in power since the dawn of time)?

&amp;#x200B;

Reasons:

(1) Hammer and Sickle are commonly associated with authoritatian state capitalist regimes like China and the USSR. Avoiding their symbolism helps to reduce the stigma around communism.

(2) The world seems to be converging to a consensus of democracy and liberal progressivism. Changing the name of the ideology to economic justice and economic democracy helps communists to SUPERFICIALLY fit into the liberal democratic framework while working towards revolutionary change. It's harder for liberals to detect their true intents. 

(3) People tend to accuse anyone who dares to mention the word communism as a ""tankie"", which they're more often than not the opposite of the original definition of tankie. Avoiding traditionally communistic symbolism helps to avoid being stigmatized by liberals. 

(4) Changing the symbolisms and party names does not mean a change in the ideology itself. Look at how most ""socialist"" and ""labor"" parties in the West are neoliberals. It does not mean mixing communism with neoliberalism but rather means adapting to the times."	88	324	0.64

Since then I've been reading every thread on reddit I can that mentions them, I've watched the commercial everyone posts, I've watched videos from autistic people claiming that supporting a cure for autism is supporting genocide, etc. 

I'm having a hard time thinking of a reason why lets say, hypothetically, testing for autism genes in a fetus is a bad thing. Would it result in women terminating those pregnancies the majority of the time? Yeah probably, I think so. How is this different than any of the other screenings we do that result in terminations? Autism, even type 1 autism is a disability, I have it &amp; while it hasn't ruined my life or the life of those around me I'd rather not have it. I can't even almost pass the reading expressions on people's faces test &amp; my emotional intelligence / capability is just low, always has been &amp; I think it always will be. I don't think I've cried since I was a child, I legitimately don't know if I'm even capable of it. Still, I'm pretty much 'best case' scenario when it comes to autistic people because I live a very normal life and I can 'pass' for NT for a while at least. Type II and type III autistic people &amp; the people that care for them? This is a whole other situation. Instead of it being a minor disability it becomes pretty major &amp; it almost can't not have an impact on the life of those around the person. It ruins lives, legitimately. 

Let's talk about the commercial because people love to post it &amp; while I'm not defending it when it says stuff like ""Are you happily married because I will make sure your marriage ends in divorce"" and ""I will bankrupt you"", those are dramatic statements &amp; they're probably  not generally true for type 1 autistic people but for type II and III, I haven't looked this up but I would think the data does shake out that way...   


Prenatal screening or some gene therapy for living autistic people does have negatives associated with it but I can't think of how the negatives outweigh the positives here. If someone is type 1 and they are happy with their situation they could just chose to not take the 'cure', I personally would.

This year, the series's viewership has gone down from last year, according to [BARB figures](https://www.barb.co.uk/), and it's not yet reached nine million in the United Kingdom this year. If the finals week isn't viewed by more than nine million viewers in the UK, then the series may possibly be in trouble next year.

I really wish the Queen's death this year would have played the major factor in the series's viewership decline. However, constant numbers that still didn't reach nine million make me think of other numerous reasons.

Probably *Bake Off* might no longer be appealing, especially to casual viewers. Probably fans, casual and hardcore alike, got tired of the series any more. Or maybe the series has become predictable, dull, or whatever. Or maybe the contestants' charisma and baking skills this year have been... lacking compared to ones from prior seasons/series. Or maybe viewers got tired of producers' perceived offstage interference on the outcome of the competition. Or maybe viewers got tired of current co-hosts' comedy gags. Or maybe viewers got tired of current judges. Or maybe viewers got tired of the series's awkward and poorly executed tribute to international cuisines, like tacos and egg/spring rolls.

There must be other reasons for the viewership decline that I'm unaware of.

However, as time goes on, the more it simply feels like the most oppressed group in America is the lower class, regardless of color. Being born into a poor family means you'll typically end up poor for the rest of your life. Even if you manage to fight and claw your way up the ladder to middle class, someone born to true poverty would never be able to become a millionaire, not in today's society. The working class is constantly being stamped down by the people with money. Getting trapped in a shitty job because you couldn't survive without it is too commonplace, and it's all mandated by people with more money. The true war that should be raging in America shouldn't be about blacks versus whites or anything like that, it should be the working class rising up against the unfair distribution of wealth and the fact that rich lives matter more then poor lives, every single time.	0	33	0.43

I believe this is bad for a few reasons:

* Essentially, landlords receive passive income from people who do productive labor, which is neofeudal and parasitic. Even in the best scenario, when the landlord contributes to upkeep of the property, it's almost never enough to justify the amount of rent they take from the person who lives there, or my following points...
* This system reinforces generational wealth inequality by funneling wealth from the working class to the owner class, and by making it more difficult for people to become first-time homeowners
* This system fuels social ills like gentrification and the absurd coexistence of homeless people *and* empty homes

**Arguments which are unlikely to change my view:**

* Anecdotes about how your own landlord is really cool
* Picking some alternative (like your city's failed public housing project or the USSR) to explain why that's also bad. **Remember, my view is NOT arguing for a specific alternative, it's AGAINST the current system** (and implicitly for the idea that some better alternative could exist)
* Something like ""You pay landlords to take the risk of the property."" It may be true to the extent that they don't constantly request government bailouts for their investment failures, but it still creates an overall bad system
* Pointing out cases of people who shouldn't/don't want to assume the responsibility of home ownership, like university students. My argument isn't that people MUST own their homes.
* ""If you say landlords are bad, then so are _______."" It's off-topic and doesn't contradict my view.

**Arguments which may change my view:**

* Proving one of my assumptions incorrect (or persuading me to change my perspective about it)
* Pointing out some overlooked advantages of the current system which convince me that my proposed law isn't necessary
* Pointing out disadvantages of my proposed law which would inevitably outweigh the advantages
* Convincing me that there's a **fair** alternative to the current system which doesn't necessitate my proposed law
* Generally, arguments which take for granted my underlying values about human rights and social goals (which are unlikely to change) but convince me that my proposed law would still be undesirable

CMV	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aq815/i_think_being_dumb_ignorant_is_better_than_smart/	"I think that people who are in the 90-100IQ range who spend their days partying, having sex, watching scripted reality TV shows and indulge in massive consumerism is enjoying existence way more than those in the 110+ IQ range who spend their time and energy pondering politics, philosophy, science and so on.

I just don't see what's so great about being smart and enlightened? It leads to angst, depression and in many cases suicide. You realize that you are just a speck of dust, you'll die, everyone you love will die, the universe itself will go heat death so there is no chance of eternal life for anyone, there is no inherent ""meaning"" to life and it's hard to create subjective meaning when you are indeed smart enough to see through the illusions, you overanalyze things and don't experience the ""magic"" that dumb people experience. In short: ignorance is bliss. They might think there is a life after death and that Kim Kardashians daily routine is sacred, but at least they are having fun and enjoying life. They might have pointless sex with random individuals with no deeper purpose, but they are nejoying it and loving it. They might not have a fucking clue about how anything in the world operates (scientifically), but they are enjoying the things.

Sure these people are not immune to depression or angst, but they don't get it from knowing too much about reality.

In that sense, hyperrealistic works of art are vain, narcissistic, but beyond that, pointless.

A post came across my Facebook timeline a few days ago, from Fubiz, entitled [""Ultrarealistic Paintings by Matt Story.""](http://www.fubiz.net/2014/09/01/matt-story-ultrarealistic-paintings/) As with most posts on hyperrealistic drawings or paintings, it got plenty of likes and ooohs and aaahs. 

I think hyperrealism is a bunch of bull however. To explain, I'd like to propose a couple of short thought experiment:

A man walks in a museum and comes across three identical, photorealistic images hanging on the wall. His friend told him that one is a photograph, one is a painting, and one is a CGI rendering, but you can't tell which is which. Other than knowing that the images were created using three separate methods, they look exactly alike. The man looks at the information plate on the wall below each image. 

The image in the middle is the photograph. ""This is just a photo of some fruit in a kitchen, *I* could've taken that."" 

The image on the left is the CGI rendering. ""Well, I guess you can do anything on a computer these days."" 

The image on the right is the painting. ""Wow, I can't believe someone painted this! This is a masterpiece!"" 

A museum guide comes over, looks at the information plates, and says: ""I'm sorry sir, someone changed these plates again. The image on the left is the photo, the middle one the painting, and the one on the right the CGI rendering."" 

The man responds: ""Oh, well then the left one is the masterpiece!""

Thought experiment 2: 

Ten year's from now, 3D printing has advanced to the point where  creating a life-sized model of a person is as easy as taking a photograph of someone. All of a sudden, anyone can create a sculpture as realistic as any of [Duane Hanson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duane_Hanson). Some artists, however, continue making realistic sculptures the hard way, with no discernible difference in outcome.

***

I contend that the only difference between photography and hyperrealism is the degree of difficulty in creating the image. If sculpting technology makes realistic sculpting easier ([we're a lot closer to thought experiment 2 than you might expect](http://www.3ders.org/articles/20131009-asda-is-first-uk-supermarket-to-create-3d-printed-mini-me-figures.html)) than the only difference between lifelike sculptures becomes the process of creation. This is why I find the man's reaction in thought experiment 1 so absurd, and the artists in experiment 2 who go the hard way vain and narcisstic. The image should be judged on the merit of itself, not how it came to be. I could find arbitrarily difficult methods for creating the most mundane images (and a lot of hyperrealistic subject matters seems to me to be rather banal), but that doesn't make those images in and of themselves more compelling.

If you create something which differentiates itself from another creation in no other way than having been harder to create, the whole point of that creation becomes the process. In other words, all that hyperrealistic artists seem to say is: ""hey, look at how amazing my skills are! I could've just taken a photograph to show you the same image (and I probably used a photograph to copy) but I wanted everyone to see my awesome replicating skills!"" How is this not just an act of ego-stroking vanity and narcissism?

I read elsewhere that the point of hyperrealism is to challenge our notion of what is real, that you cannot trust your own eyes. By deceiving the viewer into believing something is ""real"" when it really isn't (since it was painted/drawn/etc.) you make the viewer question the nature or reality itself. This is, of course, if the viewer can get over their amazement of the technical prowess of the artist to begin with. The thing that this purpose (if that's what it is, to challenge a viewer's thoughts on what's real) fails to reckon with is that photography itself is not ""real."" There's a story I remember reading (can't source it unfortunately) about a conversation between Picasso and a fellow train traveler who wonders why Picasso paints what he does. Picasso says ""I paint what I see."" The man pulls out a photo from his wallet and says something to the effect of ""but that's not reality. See this photograph of my wife, that's real."" To which Picasso answers: ""You're wife's head is 2 inches tall?""

The point is, photographs are just representations of reality, not reality itself. When a shallow depth of field puts parts of the image out of focus, those areas aren't, in reality, fuzzy all of a sudden, it's just how the camera interprets the light. Every little decision you make with a camera (or which it makes for you) influences how the camera captures and interprets the image. A photograph is the result of a complex interaction of light and the camera. (Indeed, when the actual creation of the camera is taken into account of the making of a photograph, it turns out to be vastly more complex than painting a hyperrealistic painting. But let's limit ourself to the act of the ""button-pusher."") A photograph depicts the end result of this complex process between light and camera.

In fact, photography is much more successful in pretending to be real than hyperrealistic images ever could be, because people actual think photos are real! And if hyperrealism's stated aim is to confound the boundaries between what's real and isn't by tricking the viewer, than don't photoshopped images to job much more successfully? Or what about the fact that [75% of Ikea's catalog is now computer generated](http://www.fastcodesign.com/3034975/75-of-ikeas-catalog-is-computer-generated-imagery)? Certainly fooled me. Is this the point of hyperrealism?

What does that leave hyperrealism with then? The creational process. And really, that's what gets the ooohs and aaahs, isn't it? The realization that something handmade tricked you into thinking it was a photograph, and an amazement for the skills of artist. This is not to say that we cannot (or should not) be awed by an act of creation. It *is* impressive to what degree artists can create photorealistic art. It takes time, patience, and technical skill to accomplish. But the end result should be judged on its own merit, not on the extent to which it highlights the virtues of the artist. And since the end results of hyperrealistic art offers nothing beyond what a photograph could offer - other than inflating the ego of the artist - it is truly pointless.

Would love for you to change my mind! Is there some other way I'm not appreciating the genre of art? Thanks!

***
Edit: First off, thanks everyone for responding, it's certainly given me much to think about! I found [this YouTube video interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12iW6oHCw9E) with the ""father of hyperrealism"", Denis Peterson. Asked ""Why not just take a photography"" he says ""I don't really know."" :)

They seem to have a need to replace a baby in their lives by replacing one with a relatively helpless and needy animal as compared to a cat which is less maintenance and more common. I am not suggesting owning a toy dog makes one mentally ill; it is some particular behavior associated with it that seems odd.

In addition, I have seen these women bring these dogs into stores and restaurants and talk to the dog like it is a child in a baby voice. I have seen some men doing this as well, but it seems far more prevalent in women. The demographic I most currently witness this is white and Asian women in their 20s and 30s.

I feel this is not what one would define as normal behavior, even for a loving pet owner. The dog is too small and fragile and entirely reliant on the owner for everything. I always suspect that they have an undiagnosed mental condition, because sometimes these dogs receive better care and attention than actual children.

Edit: I know the ""If everybody thought like you did..."" argument all too well. However, I don't care what a mass of people think. I want to know how does MY vote matter? My single, puny vote, among a hundred million others, swept away in a sea of insignificance ."	15	31

For example during the 1920s ALL women were supposed to get the right to vote, but this isn’t true for all women. Women of color had to fight for dozens of years by themselves to get the same rights their white female counterparts had received decades ago. 

Now I understand this example was almost a century ago and you might think they might have changed and evolved to become a more equitable and inclusive movement, but they really haven’t.
The MeToo movement is a perfect example of this, the movement despite being founded by a black women still silences women of color’s voices and capitalizes / ignores their trauma. I have genuinely not seen one woman of color highlighted in the MeToo movement and it’s really sad.

The overturn of Roe v. Wade and the reaction from the feminist movement is also another example of the how hierarchical and stratified the movement is despite claiming to be about “equality”. Black women have this highest abortion rates in the US yet they have the littlest say when it comes to abortion rights.

The next example is not pertaining to women it’s about men and the treatment of them within the movement. Men are way to demonized and generalized by feminist. To many of y’all have adopted this kill all men/man eater persona and it’s really disturbing because when you behave like that and simultaneously call yourself a feminist you are conflating the 2 ideologies making the movement look bad and contributing to men’s adversity to the movement. My first introduction to the movement was when I was like 11 or 12, I went on twitter just hangout and was met with #KillAllMen which affected my perception of feminism. I understand misandry is entirely reactionary and it is not and will NEVER be as bad as misogyny but that does not make it ok. I see misandrist on the internet and I can’t help but feel bad for them because due to their past traumas they feel the need to act like this to cope.

The crux of my argument is despite the textbook definition of feminism being about equality, in practice it never really is both historically and in present times. So why do feminists claim equality and support a movement that as built as this pseudo trick down economy where all the rights and the resources go to the white women at the top while the rest of us at the bottom have to fight 10x harder? Which may I add is the same way the patriarchy they allegedly hate is structured? I believe you guys stand for equality, the problem is that equality does not extend to everyone."	1	115	0.35

CMV	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b6krc/consent_given_while_drunk_is_still_consent/	"I realize this is a very loaded topic, but I really want to have some insights from the other side.

So, my opinion :

When people get drunk, they make the decision to give up their ability to behave in the way their not-drunk self would behave. This can manifest physically (not being able to walk straight), or mentally (kissing that ugly girl). Being drunk does not give you a magic pass to do whatever, and it won't count afterwards. Therefore, if you give consent while drunk (I know consent is a complicated thing, but for the moment, let's assume it's perfectly defined, and consent was given), you can't take it back the next morning while sober. You are also responsible for any other decision you take while drunk (driving, and getting into an accident, for exemple).

Furthermore, I think it's a very dangerous way of thinking, since it allows the false rape allegations we have all heard about, that ultimately work against the real rape victims (and of course, the poor people that go to prison for nothing). 

More importantly, I think my way of thinking would also promote to drink more responsibly, ie. either in more reasonnable quantities, or with someone ""safe"" to back you up and make sure you don't take decisions you would not take sober.


To be clear, I'm not talking about the cases where the drunk person is so drunk (s)he's passed out, or nearly so.

I also personnaly think it's an asshole move to prey on drunk people to have sex, but it's not a legal matter.

EDIT: Everyone, please stop downvoting the opinions you do not agree with, please answer with constructive arguments.

EDIT 2: For a clear(er?) summary of my opinion, see http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b6krc/consent_given_while_drunk_is_still_consent/c943v48. (Hope he doesn't change it into ""I love hitler"")

EDIT 3: A quick list of argument I've heard (and i'm tired of answering to), which are either not true or I disagree with (with arguments):

* Sex is like a contract. No it's not, see http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b6krc/consent_given_while_drunk_is_still_consent/c94g7nc
* You can easily see when someone is drunk, so you are predatory -&gt; No you can't, especially if you're drunk yourself. Anyway, this doesn't matter, as my opinion is you can give consent while drunk, which would make predation on drunk people legal, if assholish.
* The line from drunk to incapable of expressing non-consent is to difficult to determine -&gt; No it's not. If you can't physically say ""no"" or push away your partner, then you can't consent.
* Someone tried to argue that it was coercion to have sex with a drunk person ? -&gt; My definition of coercion must be different from theirs.
* If you lie to someone in order to sleep with them, it's rape through coercion -&gt; Again, not the same definition of coercion
* It's rape if the person knows they would not consent while they were sober -&gt; Except you can't know for sure someone wouldn't consent while sober, ever.
* You're a BAD VICTIM BLAMER, YOU JERK. No i'm not, i'm not blaming anyone, and I'm arguing there is no crime, and thus no victime, so I'm a BAD ~~VICTIM~~ ~~BLAMER~~, JERK at worst.

For longer arguments and discussion, please dig through the thread and have a look.

Whenever a crime happens, I think it’s worth looking at it, wholistically, , which would involve both looking at practical ways to reduce the level of that crime in society, and giving practical tips to the victims to avoid them from being victimised again in the same way, but that doesn’t mean that you support the criminal or that you’re advocating for that crime to continue in society.
For example, if I go on holiday and leave the doors of my  house wide open, and when I return everything is stolen obviously that’s the responsibility of the thief but I think it would be remiss for people who genuinely care about my welfare not to remind me  to leave my doors locked in future.
How about a person who goes to a shady part of town in a flashy new sports car, and is then surprised when that car is damaged or stolen.
When people click the links in scam emails nobody thinks it’s victim blaming to suggest that the person shouldn’t have clicked that link in the first place or recommend antivirus protection."	0	72	0.43

It seems incredibly misleading, and companies have a vested interest in keeping this practice as cloudy and misleading as possible.  Or am I wrong? 

I could see myself changing my view if someone could show me how it is best practice for the government (FDA presumably) to practice non-interference in this sector. I often hear about “government regulations killing jobs,” and likely this regulation would dent profits, as it would mean that fewer consumers would be throwing out “good” products and having to replace them due to a misleading date. Still, though, should the government not intervene, even to the point of diminishing profits and jobs, if those profits and jobs are propped up by misleading and often flatly dishonest practices?

With the prevalence of the internet, almost all speakers have access to YouTube or other platforms in which people could access their ideas. If the content of a person's speech is freely available online, the value of people hearing these same exact views in person is negligible. Without an interactive component of the speaking engagement, the value of the speaking engagement is wholly symbolic, and mostly beneficial to the speaker. They get to list a credit on their resume -- an association with a prestigious institution -- and they probably get to pocket a nice speaking fee. The value to the audience is minimal. The speaker's canned speech is indistinguishable from a screening of a pre-recorded lecture from that speaker. 

Because of that lack of value, and the ready availability of the speaker's ideas elsewhere, I believe any protest to these kind of engagements should be treated with extraordinary leniency. I have no qualms with disruptive protest that aims to create a dialogue.

If, however, the speaker comes to the event in conversation with a moderator or panelist, or if there is a question and answer component, I think the speaker is entitled to a greater level of protection. Assuming there is a good-faith effort to actually foster dialogue -- in other words, spontaneous questions are permitted, as opposed to pre-screened ones by the speaker -- the speaking engagement is producing original value for the attendees. Disruptive protest disrupts opportunity for dialogue, and it would be okay to remove the protesters in this instance.

I don't see why any innocent person would care to prevent this kind of oversight. I think it's a great alternative to expensive police helicopters or security camera networks. I think the safety issue (drones falling from the sky) is a non-issue (crossing the street is more dangerous). I think the surveillance issue is moot (who wants domestic terror or gang activity in their area). And I'd rather see this done with transparency (cops announcing the policies) than with some kind of high orbit military magic eye. Plus I could see the drone being a street crime deterrent. Basically, I don't get the downside to it. Slippery slope, civil liberties, yes, yes, but we can have laws to regulate unreasonable use, people can sue for damages after being outed or whatever, and in the long run we'll be safer. CMV liberty lovers!

It's been a few hours, I'm going off for tonight - but I have been convinced to amend my view to say: proper laws about fair use of surveillance tech and application of warrants before spying would be required and are pretty complicated to put on the books, so probably LE drones are a risky idea in the real world. BUT - this is only saying I admit a proper drone use policy would be hard to get. Not that I think having it/them would be bad if it could be accomplished."	3	54

There’s a reason it’s classic. And of coarse I think chocolate is better than raisins, but this is post isn’t about the individual components - I’m talking cookies. I’ll admit that a really good chocolate chip cookie can be as good or better, but oatmeal raisin is my go-to for a few reasons.

Oatmeal raisin cookies are much more consistently satisfying than chocolate chip. How many times do you look to a platter of cookies and are disappointed by chocolate chip? They are often too dry or have other texture issues. They can also be too rich or too bland, and factory made ones have a weird artificial flavor. With oatmeal raisin you have a way better shot at getting that chewy center, symphony of textures, and well-rounded flavor that you expect. In short, I am disappointed by chocolate chip way more often than oatmeal raisin. Just like drinkability is important to beer, “eatability” is important to a cookie. More often than not I will eat a second or third oatmeal raisin, but can only stomach one chocolate chip due to it’s richness or other problems previously discussed.

The reason I accept that my view may be flawed has nothing to do with the greater popularity of chocolate chip. It’s that my fear of disappointment leads me to chose oatmeal raisin most of the time, and as a result I could be missing out on something that could be just as good or better. 

Still, overall I think oatmeal raisin is a better cookie. CMV."	33	38	0.68

Over the last 100 years, America has fought WWII, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Iraq War, and the Afghanistan War. All of these wars were completely justified, except for maybe Iraq.

Most people say Korea was justified, and it was. North Korea invaded South Korea, an American ally, and the United States got involved to save them from a communist dictatorship.

Now for Vietnam, most people think it wasn’t justified. Many people cite American war crimes as their reason. Yes, the United States committed horrible atrocities in Vietnam, but the initial declaration of war was justified and had nearly the same context as Korea.

As for Iraq, it’s complicated. There were no WMDs, but the United States did oust a brutal dictator and stop the genocide of the Kurdish people in Iraq.

Afghanistan was also totally justified. The taliban was harbouring terrorist and the United States invaded to stop the taliban and ensure that Afghanistan remained a free country, even if they did fail"	1	140	0.39

The solution isn't forcing Wal-mart to pay more, the solution is finding a way for this country to create more jobs, so the Wal-mart employee has more options and doesn't have to work at Wal-mart.  

Cashiers and box boys aren't supposed to be able to support a family.  We need more manufacturing jobs, we need more low skilled high salary jobs that actually help the nations economy.  We need more factory jobs.

We need to be focused on the BIG PROBLEM... not the small problem that is Wal-mart.


I do not see how forcing Wal-mart to do anything will help this country, to me the answer is creating low skill jobs that deserve a living wage, and not simply giving a living wage to a low skill job that doesn't produce enough for our society.

Too young - We're living at a unique time in history where Old people are as ignorant as young people, just in different ways.  80 year old Presidents and 40 year old Presidents are not ideal, but I'd take the latter over the former.

Progressives wont like him - True, but I think deep down they know that Kamala is not going to beat Trump / De Santis.  And I hope they're smart enough to see the writing on the wall with Russia/China/Iran/Suadi Arabia, the new medieval world order.

At the start I thought it was just a blundering failure to present an anti racist message but by the end I seriously suspect there might be intentional racism at work.

Either way the view I want changed is that the film is positive towards racism, regardless of intention. I will listen my reasons. If you can refute them, or provide sufficient reasons as to how the film is powerfully anti racist then I will change my mind. 

1. The ending. This genuinely appalled me. I half expected it but I still didn't think it would be as awful as it was. The boy is reforming and is murdered by a boy who he had never even hurt, merely stood up against to prevent bullying. This is ridiculous and may be the result of cut material or something, but the but the effect is to present the racism as correct. Black people are dangerous and violent and if you change they will abuse your mercy and hurt you.

2. Negative portrayal of black characters throughout with the exception of the teacher who I will come back to and the prison friend. This feeds the narrative of exceptions to the rule that black people are violent. So much violence is caused by them in this film, especially in situations which are more relatable and natural unlike the scenes of violence driven by Norton and friends which are  insane and ideology driven.

3. Huge amount of time given to presenting racist, Nazi material visually in an uncritical way, as well as racist rhetoric and positive portrayal of racist characters. This is really three points so I'll split it up.

A) the Nazi paraphernalia. This gets a lot of screen time in a manner which makes it look neat if nothing else. The room is well put together and the art is clear and clean. This is contrast with a lot of other messy visuals. 

B) the racist rhetoric. Tonnes of time is given to very clear and strong speeches giving racist ideology. These are powerful and emotive on their own, but all the more so because there is never an actual counter argument. The most we ever get are weak emotional appeals from the Jewish man, which is almost a racist stereotype in itself, theweak and caricatured 'liberal' sister who is consistently fucked over in a manner that is horrible to view anyway but even more so when you account for the film's subtext, the black teacher who again I'll get to, and Norton himself at the end. All of it is pathetically weak but Norton's reasoning is especially shit. He simply states that he was angry and that was the problem. No tackling the ideas at all. While the racists get free reign to spout stats at length.

C) Norton in racist mode is powerful, aesthetic, cool, popular and everything you could want to be. He has it all. Even in prison he comes across cool for being principled versus the white supremacist gang. This makes it look good. Even Seth the disgusting caricature meant to turn people off, is still a flawed part because he is still benefiting massively from the gang. He has friends, status, style and gets bailed out repeatedly.

4. The black teacher. He is well acted and well written except for when tackling racism. When it comes to this there is an outrageous moment where he talks about personal responsibility and how he used to blame white people. This movie managed to both sides white supremacy. 
He does not argue against racism at all but simply says that being angry won't help.

And that brings me to my overall point to end on. This films message is that racism is true and that while there are lots of benefits of being a white supremacist, especially if you aren't insane and out of control, you still shouldn't do it because anger isn't worth it in the end and you'll end up suffering more violence by getting involved. This is highlighted throughout but especially by the shooting of the guys robbing his car. The initial shots are treated white sympathetically but the curb stomp is too far because of the level of sadism. The idea is to react clinically and efficiently where possibly or instead I guess you should just detach and ignore it all. 

It's a disturbing message and one that I think is actually very popular, especially in current America. The idea that racism is just true and real and the problem is the rude crazy violent people who then make the small jump from accepting the reality and then acting on it. That ending really stuns me with that, because yet again, as always with this film the racist violence that will ensue is framed as a response to the behaviour of black people."	0	35	0.47

In 2016 there were 963 police homicides (Washington post) in the US. Pretty much all of these cases fall under self defense laws such as necessity, where an officer kills another person to prevent bodily harm or prevent further harm from occurring. For the sake of this argument, lets assume that 25% of all police homicides are ""questionable"" (i believe that the real number would be MUCH lower than 25%, given that there are only a handful of sensationalized killings each year).

If even as high as 25% of all police homicides are questionable, that means in 2016 there would be 241 cases where an officers judgement may have been incorrect. When compared to the total population of the US (321.1 million), that means there would only be an estimated .00000075% chance of getting killed by an officer for a questionable situation yearly. That number seems pretty fucking low and pretty reasonable to me.

To compare, in 2016 there were around 1 million officers (Reports vary from 900k to around 1.1 million) and 135 officers died in the line of duty. That means there was a .000135% chance of getting killed by a civilian compared to only a .00000075% chance of getting killed by an officer as a civilian. Which means that Officers are 180x more likely to be killed in the line of duty than a civilian getting killed by an officer, yet you dont see Police protesting in the streets saying ""CIVILIANS MUST BE REEDUCATED, THEY ARE TOO DANGEROUS!"".

For some reason, many people who are anti-cop seem to forget that police are normal human beings. You give any normal human being a gun and put them in a situation where they fear for their life of the life of one of their friends, and they will defend themselves almost every time (especially considering that police officers are generally extremely stressed out or sleep-deprived), but when an officer makes a split second decision that may turn out to be incorrect, they are literally the devil and should be burned at the stake for not being a perfectly executed computer program. When you consider that human beings are extremely emotional and prone to act on instinct, seeing only around 241 people being killed a year in questionable situations out of an estimated 240,000,000 (NENA) 9-1-1 calls really does not seem like a problem so large that it demands protests and a growing ""fuck the police"" culture.

I live in a shitty part of the village where there are no bike lanes so bikers cycle on the same path as people walk.  The path is narrow and can only allow 2 persons to walk side by side. *(New information) IIt's a pretty rural village.  Cars are not allowed in and there's only one path.  The laws here only require cyclists to use the bike lane if there is one there, which not the case here.  Added to my original post.*

This morning as I was walking on the (narrow) bridge I encountered a bike coming towards me at a rather high speed.  Instinctively I jumped left to dodge it and was immediately hit by a bike that came to a screeching halt (still hit and me).  Apparently, I jumped in the way of bike#2 when dodging the bike#1. Neither of us was injured and both bikes sped off, with biker#2's ""ASSHOLE"" comment echoing behind.

Obviously, I do not think I'm the asshole/wrong at this moment but I do want to hear the argument on the other side and perhaps see what I have missed, or how I could have done better.

**What won't change my view:**

1) I should have kung-fu jumped 10 feet up above air to dodge both bikes.  I not physically unfit due to some disability and do not know kung-fu.

2) I should have jumped off the bridge to dodge both bikes.  The bridge has fenced both sides and below it a creek.

3) Anything unreasonable beyond a regular human."	0	34

Every single school district announcement, news story, or anything public on Facebook is just overwhelmed by adults attacking each other viciously. During the height of the pandemic the AG in our state was suing schools for enforcing mask mandates, school board meetings would devolve into screaming matches, and parents - ARMED- would stand outside the schools. Fucking madness. Politicians are working tirelessly to target attacks on transgender children, like relentless aggression on these kids for fucking existing. Don’t even get me started on school shootings. Police officers stood outside the school doing nothing, while adult politicians bully activists from a separate school shooting, and a child who is a climate activist. Adults are storming the capitol building acting like animals. The complete disregard for their safety during covid, and the full lack of acknowledgement that the majority of school aged students are about 2 social and academic years behind, but just push them through. Our health, and education systems are crumbling, and a potential presidential candidate for an election a year away is a walking dumpster fire with the emotional intelligence of a rabid tapeworm. 

And yet… people are throwing their arms up, like, “why are my students mean to me” “why are teens so mean” “why did this young person tell me to mind my fucking business when I asked them to stop cussing in front of my kids” “why is gen z like this”

Uhhh- I mean, probably because adults are literally trying to genocide their friends, their teachers are burnt out and ignoring the fact their entire lives uprooted for 3 years, and adults are actively behaving like self absorbed, self righteous sociopaths. The behavior of adults, both public and online, is disturbed. Adolescent and young adults are behaving, appropriately, as a reaction and reflection of the adults publicly showing their whole asses."	1	58	1.0

Some of them say they prefer other pronouns like ze/hir or they/them instead of he/him or she/her. The premise (correct me if I am misunderstanding) is that they choose to identify neither as male or female. I humor their request because they are my friends; however, secretly I do believe this is taking the issue too far. 

I couldn't say to people, ""I don't like it when people refer to me as he/him. I want to always be referred to in third person as 'concerningzombies the great.'"" This request would seem strange, and it would make me seem awfully conceited. The general response would be, ""You don't get to determine how people refer to you. That just complicates everybody's life and makes conversation very difficult. It defeats the entire purpose of having things like pronouns in our language.""

Of course this is quite an exaggeration, but the point is everybody can't have their own way of being identified. Yes you are an individual, but so is everyone. To say you don't identify as male or female is making a crude generalization for how men and women are supposed to behave. There are many different people in this world, each with unique personalities. I am content with using he/him or she/her, whichever you prefer, but I'm not okay with you inventing new words.

Pronouns aren't meant to be degrading. The English language has three singular pronouns: he, she, and it. I understand ""it"" is degrading because it is reserved for objects; however ""he"" and ""she"" are not insulting, but some people react as if they were. My belief is that the blame here lies not with the speaker, but with the one taking offense.

I understand that this is an unpopular viewpoint, so somebody explain to me why I'm wrong. CMV.

**edit:**
I've seen many repeated arguments that aren't quite responding to my view. It seems like they don't quite understand the issue. I've tried to clarify these points below.

Names are different from pronouns. I'm not saying people aren't entitled to choose their own name. Pronouns and proper nouns are different parts of speech for a reason, so stop saying it's the same as calling someone Joe when their name is Bob. It's not the same.

I know languages change. This is fine; however it is a natural process. You can't be offended by someone not conforming to your change. The only exception to this I can see are slurs, which are meant to be derogatory. If you say people shouldn't use the N-word because it is used to be insulting that makes sense. For words that aren't insulting, and especially words so basic as pronouns, I don't think anybody has any right to force a change in convention.

I'm not saying people should be identified by their sex. Sex is different from gender, but gender is a spectrum. That is why I think it is futile to add more pronouns. You can only subdivide it more. You can never encompass the entire spectrum accurately.

I do sometimes use the singular they in conversation; however the issue is there are many different choices for third person pronouns. I mentioned ze/hir because it is the one I've encountered in my life. From the Wikipedia there is also 'e/h', zhe/zher or zhim, shi/hir, hu/hus, and many others. If there was a single commonly accepted convention, that is fine. I have no qualms with that. The issue is that currently there are many different sets of pronouns trying to be popularized, and the ones in favor of using these pronouns believe that everyone is entitled to whichever they like best. Furthermore, they get offended when someone doesn't use their invented pronouns of preference. This defeats the entire purpose of having pronouns as a part of speech."	141	320

*Fair trigger warning: There will be descriptions of animal cruelty. If you don’t want to read those, jump to the next heading.*

&gt;You’ve been in this town for two months now. When you moved here in the spring for your new job you really didn’t have any social connections in the area whatsoever. To say that you were thrilled when your coworkers invited you to socialize last weekend would be an understatement. You would meet in the backyard of one coworker. You already had a bad feeling when you heard that. A warranted bad feeling, as it turns out. As you arrived you already saw them. Cages of kittens, a few lambs, and a bucket full of fish.  
&gt;  
&gt;Your host greeted you. “Hey, I’m glad you made it. Take an animal”, he said as he strangled a lamb. “Umm… thank you but I don’t strangle animals…” you answered. A few coworkers have started to listen in, when you said that. “Not even fish?” one asked. “No, no fish either”, you answered shyly. An awkward atmosphere hung in the air. In a misguided effort to alleviate the tension the host spoke up again. “Hey guy… How do you spot a non-strangler…? Don’t worry: They’ll tell you, hahahaha.” He gave you a small pat on the back. “Just kidding… You’re one of the good ones, I’m sure. To each their own, you know.” And with that he took another kitten from the cage…

# Where I’m coming from

Okay, so I’m one of those “good ones” myself. I’m a bit more vocal online but in general I don’t tell anyone I’m vegetarian if there’s not a immediate need for it (such as an invitation to dinner), I don’t speak out against omnivores eating meet in front of me or try to missionize. Hell, I even buy meet for other people while running errands from time to time.

The one thing that has always struck me the wrong way, however, is the demand that vegetarians and vegans should be tolerant towards omnivores. I think it’s fair to say that most people nowadays have a strong distaste for animal cruelty and causing the needless suffering of sentient creatures is seen as unethical at the very least. Seriously, I’ve seen my fair share of people demanding torture for people that killed animals for their amusement. Most of them weren’t vegetarian or vegan (which is why I chose that allegory above). Yet they still don’t want to be judged by vegans or vegetarians.

If you care to locate the dissonance between those two things, it oftentimes boils down to “food is different and there’s no way to eat without causing some suffering.” But food isn’t really different: Most of us can live exactly as or even healthier and better without eating meat than on an omnivorous diet. We can’t really buy that explanation because our mere existence refutes it. Similarly it’s true that we can’t eat without causing some suffering but time and time again it has been shown that not consuming meat is probably the single most-effective harm/suffering-reducing decision an individual can make. The way I’m seeing it is that it’s basically a “I don’t care how the sausage gets made” situation.

If we are using tolerance the way we currently do, as the arbiter through which we enforce societal norms while still allowing for a pluralistic discourse, we should be consistent about it. You can’t have your ~~cake~~ animal love and eat ~~it~~ them.

Maybe ya’ll can make me stop feeling bad about being “a good one”: Change my mind.

Edit: I'm gonna copy &amp; paste a small addendum here, as it comes up frequently and I might be misunderstood in my opinion:

Yes, this isn't something that's really relatistic:

&gt; This is very much a opinion that's firmly placed in the ""nice if it were true"" category. We can still have those, right? There are people here regularly arguing ""a ethno state would be awesome"" and we still engage in those on the basis of ""what if?"", right?

In situations where the old ruling families were not completely taken out of the picture, they tend to stick around either to challenge republican government at a later date or act as an ideological opposition to its development.

CMV	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1uk7dp/i_believe_universal_public_healthcare_no_private/	"I'm from Canada but I have family in the United States and friends from South Korea; three different systems of health care with varying levels of private sector involvement. Of these three, I see Canada's as the most fair, because people of all income levels get the same quality of care (for the most part, it's not perfect). It prevents people from having to make the painful choice between sickness and bankruptcy. Publicly-employed doctors are also more likely to work to prevent illness because they don't get more money if their patients get sick.

The United States is the worst out of the three, because the quality of care you receive is almost completely parallel with your income level. If you don't have good insurance, when you get sick you essentially have the choice between denying yourself care and making it worse or taking a huge hit out of your bank account. This can mean having to mortgage/sell your house or even skip buying food.

Even if you can afford it, it has the potential to completely ruin your life. For example, my great aunt who lives in Cincinnati was a nurse all her life and her late husband was a doctor all his life. They were smart with their money and saved a lot to be able to retire comfortably. However, my great aunt has chronic hip problems which are not covered by her (already expensive) insurance plan. Frequent trips to the hospital over the years has forced her to live in an expensive elderly care complex, also not covered by her insurance. From all those costs plus hospital bills, she has gone completely bankrupt and has few places left to go.

My grandmother, on the other hand, lives in Toronto. When she got cancer, everything other than her wheelchair was covered by OHIP (Ontario Health Insurance Plan). Now she's made a full recovery and it cost us relatively little. In fact, out of curiosity we looked up the price of the medication she was taking, and if we would have lived in the States, it would have cost us $30,000 a month. We would have had to sell our house.

Needless to say, I was happy when the Affordable Healthcare Act was passed, but I feel as if this is only the first step and it will only take us to what South Korea has which is a tier system; the poor gets the bare minimum and the rich have the luxury of shorter lines, better equipment, better-trained doctors, etc. While I think it's a step in the right direction, I still hold firm that higher income level does not entitle you to better chance of survival when you're sick. Instead, taxes should be raised and everyone should have an equally good chance.

A common criticism of Canadian healthcare is that lines are always very long. I think this is because of two reasons: One, nobody ever decides not to go to the hospital because they can't afford it. ""When in doubt, ask a doctor"" is the attitude, as it should be. Two, most science-oriented students nowadays go into engineering or computer science rather than medicine. This can be fixed by encouraging more biology in schools, making more med school scholarships, etc. The solution is not to re-think the entire system.

**TL;DR Universal healthcare is worth the higher taxes and longer lines because all people get the same care regardless of income level, you never have to choose between food or medicine, and hospital bills will never bankrupt you**"	686	632

The pre-assimilation (language) requirements for most visa classes are what makes it successful."	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3yypu7/cmv_the_reason_multiculturalism_works_in_canada/	"A lot of politicians, mainly in Europe but also in the US, have declared multiculturalism a failure, including David Cameron (UK) and [Angela Merkel](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/17/angela-merkel-german-multiculturalism-failed) (DE). Multiculturalism advocates often point to Canada as a successful multicultural society, but there are strict migration requirements that mean that it is not at all multicultural in the European or American sense:

-[Over 60% of immigrants to Canada arrive on economic visas.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_Canada) Most of these visas have a language requirement of CLB 4 in English or French. [Many if not most non-refugee visas, accounting for about 90% of immigrants, also have language requirements.](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/eligibility.asp)

-CLB 4 is the same level of proficiency required to [obtain citizenship.](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?q=569&amp;t=5) In other words, in order just to get a ""green card"" you have to speak English or French well enough to get citizenship. Compare this to countries like Sweden or the US where there is a significant proportion of legal residents who do not speak the language. The result is that most people who arrive in Canada have already done a lot of the assimilation and are in many ways already ""Canadian enough to get citizenship.""

Now the decision of which regimes to take down should NOT rest with the United States alone.  That power should rest with the United Nations.  However, I find it undeniable that there are certain regimes around the world that NEED to be removed for the sake of the world.  The clear cut examples of these would be states like North Korea or Somalia.  Nations with either horribly dictatorial governments, or no government to speak of.  In either case, the result is very similar.  Massive human rights violations, and a complete lack of even basic governmental services for their populations.  In instances like these, as long as we have secured an adequate commitment from other nations to securely build or rebuild the nations in question, it is not only pragmatic, but morally necessary to step in and provide these people's with basic security and basic human rights.  


Also, the US has done these sorts of nation building exercises successfully in the past.  The go to example of this is the Balkan crisis.  An American led coalition stepped in and put a stop to the human rights abuses happening in the region, the US and her allies stayed in the region to help in rebuild, and today the area is rapidly moving toward the same standard of living in the rest of Europe.  


Now I know that these sorts of endeavors can fail and fail badly.  The best(or at least most public) example of this is probably Iraq. In this example, the US completely succeeded in it's goal of removing the Ba'athist party of Saddam Hussein from power, but failed miserably in the follow on effort.  

However, the US and the international community has learned a lot from the failure of the rebuilding effort in Iraq. I think if we went in to Iraq knowing what we know now, we'd do a lot differently, and the result would probably be very different.

Bad system is bad, adopt it  to prove a point. That way you can truly be part of the solution instead of bitching about it because you will be blowing on the cinders, sparking bigger flames faster, then when it burns the forest down you can say you were right that this system doesn't work and not have your soul sucked dry resisting it. Even better because you supported it a feminist can't blame you for fucking it up somehow, you were being an ally, you said the words, you did the things. Maybe if you're lucky ""respecting wamin"" will find you a girlfriend I hear girls like respect and you can enjoy the decline together. If it works it works if it doesn't it doesn't, also feminists can spend less time fighting opposition and more time with actual social reform, right?

If patriarchy is so good, then stop supporting it with your actions to demonstrate why it is so good. Simple geometry. If feminism is so bad, then when it doesn't have an opponent to fight on the outside it will collapse on itself. Take this challenge for example, I'm literally recruiting from the enemy and giving clear motive that fuels the ego of even the most self serving and self destructive malignant narcissist to smile and play along, if a feminist says anything bad about this they are turning on themselves because what I advocate for their victory and the surrender of opposition. The only way to beat this is to assume bad faith. It's a perfect trap for both sides because both sided will oppose the idea even though it guarantees their victory over their opposition, and worse it unites them in an idea against me therefor building a bridge.

I've solved the equation so you don't have to. Now come at me and crucify me. Will give triangles for good feedback.

Another example is a father sacrificing himself to save his child in a burning home in order to not live with the guilt that he has lost his child. It seems like every 'altruistic' action that I can think of has some sort of personal benefit, whether be it inner peace or building of 'soft' skills. Thus, it seems, everyone is driven to satisfy his or her own personal goals, whether subconsciously or consciously, in each altruistic action.

So... are there any truly altruistic actions where the performer does not get inner satisfaction (e.g., removing grief)?"	27	38

Limiting how local and federal law enforcement can interact is bad policy.	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3d3f3u/cmv_sanctuary_cities_are_dangerous_limiting_how/	"The shooter was being held in a San Francisco jail on a 20-year-old drug charge, which a judge ultimately threw out. Although he was wanted by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement for multiple offenses, city officials were prohibited by city law from notifying ICE before releasing him.  Considering that local and federal law enforcement officials routinely cooperate in order to apprehend known and suspected criminals, why should undocumented immigrants be given a special exemption?

Supporters of sanctuary cities have forwarded the argument that undocumented immigrants would be less likely to cooperate with local law enforcement if they feared deportation, but the fact of the matter is that they are here illegally and ought to face the consequences of their actions, just as Americans who commit criminal offenses face the consequences of *their* actions (where are the sanctuary cities for *Americans*?).  There is no reason why cities should refuse to comply with federal immigration laws and create possible sanctuaries for those who pose a danger to society.  If the ICE had been properly notified of the shooter's release from jail - remember, they had a *warrant* out for his arrest - they could have arrested him and avoided the entire incident that has now claimed a life.  Why should shielding undocumented immigrants from federal agents take precedence over cooperating with them to enforce immigration laws?  Why do the benefits of sanctuary cities outweigh the negatives that the shooter's release - despite his known criminal background - illustrate?

Sanctuary cities allow undocumented immigrants who may have a criminal background and pose a threat to roam freely.  It seems ludicrous to me that city law prevented San Francisco officials from even *informing* federal immigration agents that the shooter had been released.  Limiting how local and federal law enforcement can interact undermines our nation's immigration laws and provides shelter for those who would otherwise be taken into custody due to criminal activity (the shooter has admitted to fleeing to SF after crossing the border *specifically* because it's a sanctuary city; who is to say that other criminals who are undocumented don't do the same?).  It seems reasonable for the government to strip cities of funding if they harbor these individuals instead of facilitating their transfer to federal agents.  If cities don't want to comply with federal law, they ought to lose federal funding.  Isn't that only logical?

Despite my strong objection to sanctuary cities, I am open to any and all responses that might cause me to view them in a more favorable light."	7	22

I know how to do X, employer needs X done, they pay me to do it. Based on that, it would seem that the only thing that should matter as to whether someone gets a job is ""what they know"" - how well they can do X.

But the truth is that the vast majority of jobs don't actually work like that.

When someone is given responsibility, they are also given trust. No matter how small or big that responsibility, the employer/client/whatever trusts the person to do the job well. By definition, in business, everyone is out for themselves - as they should be. No one should join a company and give hand their lives over to it. 

So we have a situation where Person A needs Person B to do something in exchange for payment, but Person B has different objectives. They want to get paid as much as possible for as little work as possible. Maybe they'll screw over Person A given the chance. Maybe they won't fit in with the rest of the team, leading to tensions and arguments and valuable time and resources being wasted in feuds.

This is where ""who you know"" comes in. If you know someone: 

\- First off there is some element of social contract there: they have a vested interest in honoring their task fairly because otherwise the repercussions may be social and severe.

\- You may have reassurances of their trustworthiness: either you or someone you trust has worked with them before, and can assure you of their ability to fulfill your objectives. It's not 100% sure. It's not a perfect guarantee in any way. But it's better than the unknown.

\- You may know whether they will fit in your company culture. I know the term is loathed, but it's true: I have seen people last 3 months in a role because while they were completely qualified they did not fit in culturally. 

All in all, if you have the choice between two perfectly qualified candidates, but one of them comes with those social guarantees, it is perfectly reasonable to choose them.

Of course, this can lead to discrimination, loss of opportunity, etc. So as a society, we want to discourage that. But on the individual level, it is perfectly reasonable to want to work with people you know.

After all, who would you trust the most to watch your pets while you're away? Someone you know and trust who has cared for one dog, or someone off the street you don't know who has cared for two dogs?"	8	16

For instance, a blade of grass relates to itself through biology and evolution and, while not fully conscious, relates to itself and therefore has a spiritual being. Another instance is the alien race in Ender's Game: a hivemind that, while uninterested in anything but swarming other planets and self-propagating, still has spiritual substance because it relates to itself through war and again, biology. It's a Hegelian concept first expounded in The Phemonology of Spirit.

Then Zizek switches to Capital. Capital started out as a way to mediate between commodities: I have a pencil, you have a dollar, you want my pen more than a dollar so you give me the dollar in exchange. But where the breakdown occurs is, the money starts to self relate, where I think I have a dollar and I think you have 1.5 dollars but are valuing it at one dollar so I trade my stocks to get your 1.5 dollars which 20 years later turns out to be only 75 cents. This happens through inflation, through the stock market, through future trading (think the Big Short where 4 trillion dollars vanish without a trace, and reduce the housing market of by that much, forcing even people who pay their rent to vacate), or even just through petty theft. Rather than representing the human commodities, it becomes the human commodities itself.

Due to this becoming it takes on a spiritual life of its own: a reckless monster with no regard for human society. I know there are some in America (maybe the top 10 percent) who have privileged access to capital that allows us to buy Tesla-like products, but that is because of America's Imperial history of vaccuming up wealth from other nations and giving them a pittance in return. Even if you redistributed the world's wealth of 241 trillion dollars each person would only end up with 34,428 dollars to utilize over their lifetime, which seems like a lot but isn't even close to buying an electric car (not to mention purchase a weatherised ecofriendly home). And that wealth has to be spread out over 50-70 years because it is all there is left, no more wealth on the planet to spread. Also all of the investment money, all of the stock markets would be dissipated and require reinvestment to even produce electric cars or Eco homes and again, people wouldn't have nearly enough money to invest when they're living on about 700 dollars a year out of their 34,500.

This is why I believe that progressive taxation or cap and trade will never be able to make the cost-benefit ratio sufficient to stop using oil or clogging up the oceans or landfills. Capital must be overthrown, abolished just like slavery before it. It is a self-relating, self-accelerating substance that cares not about human or animal life and it never will. The majority of fossil fuel was burnt in the last 25 years precisely when we've seen the global triumph of capitalism. Any attempt to contain it or reform it only distorts it into something uglier and more ruinous. 

We have to reform societies and economies to work through central planning and local distribution. Never before has that project been so easy as now that we have the computer to work the equations for us. Through central planning of elected officials with 20 year term limits and no overarching leader, humans themselves can determine what is valuable in the market instead of capital doing it for us. The jobs that need to be done of building solar powered trains perhaps by repurposing gas-guzzling vehicles can be commenced immediately instead of waiting for capital to become compliant in the gesture. A common rebuttal is the selfishness of humans, but is that not an argument for abolishing capital? Some people just don't want to work and forcing them to in order to have their basic needs met is pure evil. Some of those people think they don't want to work, but all that is needed is the healing of having a home, food on the table, a real society to engage with and no access to narcotics, and after a couple of years of this, many of them would want to contribute to the society which has made them whole again. Regardless, the majority of society has strong work ethic, 3.5 billion of the world is in abject poverty living on under 2 dollars a day and still they go to their soul eating capital generated jobs. There will be mistakes made but they will be human in nature instead of largely inanimate and completely unsympathetic, alien in nature. I know it will take a lot of convincing people to do this but that's not my point, my point is that capital will never get the job done.

Thank you for reading that ridiculous wall of text. Look forward to discussion below."	43	101

However, huge agribusinesses and individual farmers continue to plant thousands of acres of rice in the Central Valley. Fields are flooded for this, and it takes two-and-a-half times as much water to produce rice as it does to produce an equivalent amount of wheat. There are many other low-water crops that could also be grown. Crops should be grown in regions that best support their needs. Rice can come from the much wetter Eastern US or from many place abroad that receive more rainfall than California. Why should I have to worry every time a take a shower, flush my toilet, or give my kid a bath when I know that just over the hills there are fields flooded with hundreds of thousands of gallons of water for a crop we can easily get from somewhere else?

The IRS does not tax you when you get back the money you used to pay for an investment. (Ie, If you buy a bond for $100, and it pays you back your $100 plus $5 of interest, the IRS does not tax you for making $105, just for making $5). I’d argue that education is an investment, with the principal being your tuition, which you expect to get back, along with “interest”, by earning a higher salary. Thus, the money you earn, up until the amount you paid for tuition, should just be considered you getting your investment principal back, and should not be taxed. There may be an argument for separating out college costs not directly associated with education (ie, some tuition pays for student extracurriculars, the campus gym....)	40	16

Leaving morality aside, from a utilitarian perspective, it appears the hindrance on progress outweighs the happiness of the few who cannot keep up. In nature, this process is wildly spread trough natural selection. 

To change my view, argue that universally speaking, solidarity and compassion are more beneficial to progress than Nietzsche's philanthropy.

We are very evidence based.  Our pediatrician says there is literally no conclusive data either way and it has to be up to us. 

We've obviously heard a ton of things from biased sources which we cannot confirm (I.e. Circumcision results in less pleasure, or 10% of all uncircumcised males need to get one as an adult for medical reasons anyways).

We know that actual data says a circumcised male gets the benefits of better cleanliness and slightly lower chances of STDs.  We dont think anyone should rely on that to prevent stds but the other benefits might be nice.  We also find the fact that most males in the US, and I (the father) am circumcised, is a minor reason ( no kids wants to look different, could be more harmful than the other indications).

The main evidence backed reason not to circumcise is the miniscule chances of complications which we find acceptable, and the ""don't do unnecessary irreversible medical procedures to babies who cannot consent"" argument, which we find the benefits outlined above just barely overcomes.

Am I missing anything? Change my view! But don't bother unless you have a real unbiased medical source backing it up, studies in particular are preferred!"	3	75

It is essentially penalizing people who chose to flee the violence of NYC by taxing them even more and driving them head first into Republican arms. It will go to a bloated NY subway system that mismanages funds and can't even conduct proper maintenance. It will divide NY and NJ at a time when both of those states need to stick together.	0	46	0.5

These are people who could have become activists but instead are completely disconnected from any type of serious journalism.

We're not allowed to own guns, except for hunting, collecting (where they must be non-functional) or competition use. Most of the people in my country disagree with my opinion, which is why I want it challenged.

I also realize this is a multi-faceted question, with a lot of nuance. Because of this I'm going to limit the specific form of gun ownership to semi-automatic handguns and rifles, to be kept in the home. This doesn't fully represent my actual views on this topic, but if I included everything I fear the discussion is going to get bogged down in details about open carry, what types of guns should be allowed, etc. etc. and while those are worthwhile discussions, I believe it will be too broad to be useful in this particular instance.

I'll list some reasons I'm for gun ownership as a right:

1. Self-defense, in particular against home invasions. I believe it is every person's right to be able to defend their home with (possibly deadly) force if they or their family is threatened. I still absolutely believe there should be an investigation, but we should in cases of doubt rule in favor of the home-owner.
2. Limiting the monopoly over violence the government has. I do not believe the state should have a full monopoly on violence. This is commonly phrased as being able to stand up against a tyrannical government - although I view it more as a deterrent. An oft cited counterargument goes something like ""They got tanks and drones - what are your guns going to do against that?"". I don't really buy this one, for three reasons: The government is supplied by the people and the military is not going to be undivided in these cases, and finally, there's a lot more oppressed than oppressors. The only way to overcome this divide is by stripping the people of lethal force.
3. A more well-prepared militia in cases of outside invasion. Pretty self-explanatory, but a gun-owning population will be better prepared to put up a resistance against an occupying force.
4. Gun laws seem rather ineffective at limiting gun crime, or if you wish to be less generous, crime in general.

If you cite statistics in support of your arguments, I would appreciate if you linked the source as well. Finally I just want to say that I know this can be a contentious issue, and I really don't want the debate to turn sour. I fully realize I might be experiencing a ""grass is greener"" effect, since I've never lived in a country with gun rights."	40	142	0.71

I strongly disagree with this statement. I did not vote this election due to the fact that I voted in the primaries for Bernie Sanders. After finding out how Debbie Schultz and Hillary Clinton screwed them over, Bernie supporters felt betrayed and decided not to vote for her.

My main argument why voting in the US is useless is because we have an electoral college. There is a great video supporting my argument here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90RajY2nrgk&amp;t=2s

The electoral college gets to decide who wins the election not the voters (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_elections_where_winner_lost_popular_vote)

Voting for a democratic in a republican state is also useless. I live in a southern US state. My vote really is not going to help.

Why should I vote for two people I do not like? Why would I wait in line for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump when I highly disliked both of them? I have a right to complain and I have a right to vote for whoever I wanted to. Don't chastise me because I didn't vote for the lesser of two evils. Hillary/Trump needed to win over my vote and they failed to do so. Also, I am sure the electoral college was paid off. Change my view!

Wired headphones (especially with removable cables) can last for decades and can often be repaired if something breaks. I am not aware of any bluetooth earbuds that allow you to replace the battery without having to do surgery on the bud. This often makes them impossible to fix when (not if) they die.

All the material to make those earbuds will probably end up in a landfill. This is a waste of materials that could be better used elsewhere. If you are part of the tiny minority of people that actually gets recycleable buds and then actually recycles them, you get a pass here. But I believe that the amount of people who actually do that is negligible. 

Each bud individually may contain a small amount of materials, but if everyone is buying these every couple of years, that will add up over time."	75	130	0.7

Majority of the things that have come out of Trumps mouth have been proven false. [source](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/)

So it's obvious that Trump is a liar. And when he doesn't flat out lie he exaggerates things or misrepresents information. I believe Trump does this on purpose because he's a master salesman and a salesman's only agenda is to CLOSE THE DEAL. Trump is simply trying to close the deal on his candidacy at any cost because once he's elected office it's too late, he's president now. No wall, no economic reform nothing. And Trump knows this. This is why he's a conman. 

His supporters are gullible for believing his absurd statements or they are willfully ignorant because they think at the very least, he'll enact some sort of white nationalistic agenda. 

They could have voted Rand Paul but they didn't for some reason so I don't believe trump support is due to lack of options.

But lately, I have been noticing that most people I know who own firearms are really itching to use them. Some of them even go as far as attempt to ""bait"" someone to come on their property just so they can shot somebody. 
Also have other friend who is always talking about how he want to gather group of gun owners and force Obama out of the office (he actually talk about how much he want to put bullets in some people head)

Just now a friend was telling me about how he was disappointed that he cannot make trip to Bundy's Ranch because he bought a new rifle that would be perfect to take a man out.

So... If firearms is for self defense... Howcome it seems like most of them are itching to just shot somebody? This is quickly turning me into anti gun person."	3	52

That being said, feel free to extrapolate to other scenarios but I don’t promise that I will consider them necessarily the same. With that being said, let’s get into it.

So generally speaking, it is somewhat expected that the man pays for dinner on a date (lots of people say the person who invited out the other person should pay but in general this is basically de facto man pays). In my experience, usually when I go out on a date the woman makes a token offer to pay without the expectation of actually having to. I’ve never gotten a second date where I’ve taken her up on that offer and even the girl I’m seeing now has said “yes if you had taken me up on my offer to pay then there would have been no second date because no one one’s date someone whose cheap”.

What I have a problem with is that if paying is that big of a deal to someone that they will not go on a second date, theyre not really offering to pay. What theyre doing is putting up a test to determine the personality of the person theyre with if you want to frame it in the best possible light and even then I still frankly find it a little off putting. It feels inconsistent to me because I feel like people who make this offers genuinely do think they’re being nice despite the fact it’s completely fake.

TL;DR Summary: if someone offers to pay for a date with a second date being contingent on them not taking that offer, they’re not actually being genuine in offering to pay for that date. CMV

Edit: I think the subject of what is supposed to be changed isn’t clear so I’m going to try to clarify it here. The question is “Is offering to pay and then not having a second date if the offer taken a genuine offer to pay?” while my stance is “this is not a genuine offer”. It is not a matter of “does this make sense”. But “should they other person feel like they’re making a genuine offer?”"	97	86	0.75

-scrap the death penalty. It does nothing to deter crime, it costs too much, poor people/minorities receive it most, and its inhumane.

-use life sentences/long sentences sparingly. Life sentences should be applied just like the death penalty (except for the minorities/poor part)

-there should be shorter limits on how long youth offenders serve. The US allows life sentences for offenders under 18; I think that this ought to be prohibited.

-focus on actually rehabilitating people through job traning, etc so they don't turn back to crime.

-improve prison conditions. Many correctional facilities, such as those in the south, have inadequate air conditioning.

-liberalize our drug laws to cut down on our massive prison population.

So one can be racist without intending harm (making assumptions about my experiences because I'm black could be an example), but one cannot be racist if they their action/decision wasn't made using race or ethnicity as a factor.

So for example if a 100m sprint took place and there were 4 black people and 4 white people in the sprint, if nothing about their training, preparation or the sprint itself was influenced by decisions on the basis of race/ethnicity and the first 4 finishers were black, that would be a disproportionate outcome but not racist. 

I appreciate that my example may not have been the best but I hope you understand my overall position.

Disproportionate outcomes with respect to any identity group (race, gender, sex, height, weight etc) are inevitable as we are far more than our identity (our choices, our environment, our upbringing, our commitment, our ambition etc), these have a great influence on outcomes.

I believe it is important to investigate disparities that are based on race and other identities but I also believe it is important not to make assumptions about them.

We evolved into the civilizations we are now because we utilized each sex's unique talents separately. This meant men competed with men, and women competed with women in their respective fields. Then, when the day was over, men would go home to their wives and be free from the stress of competition. Women would also console men and help them back up when they fail (inevitable in a competitive society), cause they are naturally evolved to be the caretakers. 

Now days, men and women are both allowed in the workplace and there is increasing competition between the sexes. This mostly comes from women who want to show men they are capable of doing what men do, while ignoring their natural feminine abilities. The result is too few people (at least in America) care about the other members of society. Everyone is simply out to get as much as they can for themselves.

In my current assessment, it seems people are getting angrier easier now, and they can't blow off steam because they can't find the opposing force that calms them down and reassures them. Women play weird, manipulative games with men because the only advantage they have over them is sexual and they want to win at something, even if it's a game they made up inside their own heads. 

I may be sexist, but I believed for years that women were equal to men, and I treated them as if they were the same. But they are not the same, and do not want to be treated the same. I know I'm not alone dealing with this cognitive dissonance (just look at The Red Pill movement or any other relationship ""game"" theory). 

I feel as though we've strayed too far from our nature as binary beings and most of the current chaotic political/social climate is due to this. "	0	53

I believe that the political landscape has become ultra-polarized, with the vast majority of people being able to categorize themselves with other people with like-minded politics.  Progressive millennials are able to center themselves around Bernie Sanders.  The alt-right is a very strong, cohesive group led by Donald Trump.  Social conservatives, libertarians, tea-partiers, socialists, environmentalists, etc have their own niche communities and politicians to follow.

I feel my political viewpoints put me at odds with all of the above groups, and none of them would accept me as one of their own.  In addition, very few (if any) politicians on the national level represent my views as a whole. Some of my viewpoints include:

*  Reducing the corporate tax rate and capital gains rates.  Stop taxing US companies and persons on foreign profits, and move to a territorial tax system.
* Creating a public option for healthcare on a federal level, but oppose single payer
*  Oppose ""free"" college education.  Eliminate or greatly reduce Department of Education
* Raise minimum wage according to inflation
* Implementing a carbon tax and favor wind/solar/nuclear energy development
* Strong support of the 2nd amendment
* Reducing the military budget and military presence overseas
* Pro-choice, pro-gay marriage, pro-trans rights, end the War on Drugs
* Enforcing immigration law and limiting the number of refugees taken in, but no wall.
* I have no problem with Citizens United and other current campaign financing laws
* Increasing federal spending for infrastructure, NASA, national parks, and protection of the Great Lakes
* Pro-free trade, anti-protectionism

More on a personal level, I'm a mid-20s grad student in accounting/finance.  I'm half-white/half-asian, heterosexual, and am not religious but have no problem with religion.  I come from a lower-middle class background.

I would like to be convinced that I have some sort of political ""home"", and that my views as a whole are represented somewhere in today's political society.

CMV	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1a29o0/i_think_that_homosexuality_is_a_choice_cmv/	"Disclaimer: I have the utmost respect for homosexuals and respect their rights and decisions. Also, I got the idea for this CMV from /u/babycakesss when he made a CMV post concerning the topic of transsexuals.

I believe this is pretty self-explanatory. I think the vast majority of homosexuals aren't homosexual because they were born that way, but because they chose it. Their reasons for choosing it could be due to a number of different reasons ranging from sexual abuse at a young age to boredom to reasons that I can't understand.

If homosexuality is *not* a choice, then wouldn't it be considered a mutation? (I admit that this statement is a weak point in my argument and may be wrong.)

And if it's a mutation, is it very likely that ~10% of the population was born with a such a mutation? Or is it more likely that homosexuality is not something that one is born with but is instead due to that person's experiences and observations in life?

Again, I'm not trying to be disrespectful by labeling homosexuality as a mutation. Please Change My View, Reddit! :D

**EDIT:** Alright, awesome. That was really quick! I didn't necessarily change my view but I did realize that my wording was terrible. That's probably why I shouldn't start a debate after midnight. ;D If I were to do it over again, I would say debate the *cause* of homosexuality. Is it nature or nurture? Genetic mutation or environmental interference? And it seems the general consensus is that no one is completely sure. I'm leaning more toward environmental interference, but /u/TRAIN_INSANE made a good point when he said:

&gt;There is strong evidence that homosexuality is not a choice. For example, there is the presence of homosexual behaviors in animals. Animals have no society to pressure them, if homosexuality was driven by society, why would animals display homosexual behaviors? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_animals_displaying_homosexual_behavior

If what he said is true (and it is to a certain extent b/c sexually confused dogs that I witnessed at a young age) then that could mean that it *isn't* society and environmental interference.

In any case, I'm too tired to keep thinking and thanks for the open minds, everyone! I love CMV. :D"	42	72

&gt;“Hillary wants to abolish, essentially abolish the 2nd Amendment. By the way, and if she gets to pick if she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks. Although the 2nd Amendment people, maybe there is. I don’t know.”

Many people interpreted this as encouraging his supporters to assassinate either Clinton or her judicial appointments. 

The Trump campaign has since come out and claimed that Trump was talking about Second Amendment advocates unifying to vote against Hillary. For example, Mike Pence said:

&gt;""Of course not. Donald Trump is urging people around this country to act consistent with their convictions in the course of this election. And people who cherish the 2nd Amendment have a very clear choice in this election.""

**Now, to be clear, we have no way of knowing what Trump *meant*, so all we can debate is the meaning of the actual words he said.**

I hold that if we go by what he SAID, the only possible interpretation is one of advocating violence. The key is in this sentence:

&gt;**if she gets to pick her judges**, nothing you can do folks. Although the 2nd Amendment people, maybe there is. 

As the ""if..."" clause makes clear, in this part of the speech he's making a hypothetical about what will happen if Hillary is elected president. The Trump campaign explanation for his statement thus makes no sense...IF Hillary gets to pick her judges, there is nothing the Second Amendment folks could do about that by voting, because if Hillary is picking judges then the election is *already over*. 

To put it another way: Trump's assertion is that Second Amendment folks might be able to do something ""if Hillary is picking judges."" There's no way he could be referring to voting, because if Hillary is picking judges, the voting has already happened. Moreover, Trump suggests that only second amendment people (gun owners) would have a chance of doing something about her judicial choices. From his own statement, we know that he is:

1. Not talking about voting, because in his hypothetical the voting has already happened, and...
2. He is specifically singling out gun owners as being the ones able to affect a change.

How can this statement possibly be interpreted as anything other than a suggestion that second amendment advocates might shoot Clinton or her appointees? 

I'm not sure whether I can be convinced or not, but I'm open to changing my view if you can provide a convincing argument that Trump's words could be reasonably interpreted to mean something else.

Also, would this constitute as a delta? If this appears disingenuous, I apologize.

Also some views are indeed changed. I am thinking in relation to the maslow hierarchy of needs, though as some of you pointed out fulfilling it from bottom to top is not strongly supported, and the higher tiers can fulfill lower tiers by going top-down. 

original:
Lets face it, human’s basic nature is to survive and ensure the species survive (through reproduction), so first we need food, water, health, shelter, security (through settlements, clans, nations even). When in a basic level only these matter, because survival is prime priority, without these the species would go “brr” - extinct.

Therefore, there is no point talking democracy to places where food, health, security is not even ensured yet, no one would understand how democracy is needed because they need other things first, therefore democracy is not a basic need but a need that only exists after you fulfill and sure you provide all those basic needs.

If you live in a first world democracy be grateful that you have these basic needs fulfilled, you may protest because that is your right (assuming it is written in your constitution), you may complain, but don’t act like your government is the worst in the world.

Views established,
1. Democracy is a higher tier need
2. First world citizens who live in a democracy, be grateful"	2	39	0.56

CMV	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1q27x1/i_believe_that_by_definition_feminism_believes/	"Definition of [Democracy](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/democracy): a government in which the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised by them directly or indirectly through a system of representation usually involving periodically held free elections.

Definition of [Patriarchy Theory](http://womenshistory.about.com/od/feminism/a/patriarchal.htm): Patriarchal (adj.) describes a general structure in which men have power over women.

So the basis of my argument is as follows. In a democracy power is equally distributed amoung its citizens who then vote for a representative for a certain amount of time. It is fundamentally based upon everyone have the same amount of power.

Patriarchy theory (in every definition I've ever seen) makes the claim that men have power (or more power) over women. But because the population of both sexes is more or less equal, according to democracy both sexes should have the same amount of power.

As such, because of Patriarchy Theory, by definition feminism must believe that these societies are not democratic.

Fundamentally Mohammad was a warlord, a conqueror, a mass murderer, a sex slaver, and a pedophile. All of the behaviors the west finds deplorable about Islam are its core tenets and examples provided by Mohammad in the Qorran and Hadiths. 

His first conquest came through Hijrah, or jihad through immigration. Hounded from his home for stirring up violence Mohammad fled to Medina where he was taken in as a refugee. After five years of importing other violent men and converting locals he rose up and conquered Medinain. In this aspect the hijrahdis or so called refugees are following his example to a T. 

In another episode Mohammad captured a Jewish tribe, stripped all the men naked, and if they had pubic hair he put them all to death while their women watched on. A woman who refused to be a sex slave was also put to death. ISIS is following this exploit exactly. 

Islam teaches that gays should be thrown off of the mountain. All over the Muslim world they throw gays off of roofs fulfilling his instruction as closely as possible. 

Mohammad was a sex slaver of non Muslim women and also enjoyed having sex with girls as young as 9.  The Rotherham pedophile sex ring was being true to this example. 

Muhammad encouraged the killing of apostates (anyone who wasn't Muslim) so in this fashion terrorists are being true to his example. 

So called ""moderate Muslims"" follow a bastardized version of Islam that had very little to no text to back up their beliefs. 

Anyone familiar with the life and exploits of Mohammad would have to admit the Muslim ""extremists"" are more faithful to Mohammad's teaching/example than so called ""moderate Muslims"".

I'm talking about the common ""betta fish cups"", not the selling of the fish themselves.

Even in pet stores dedicated to the aquarium hobby, it's very common to find shelves of betta fish in individual cups with obviously insufficient room, as well as no regular filtration, oxygenation, or temperature regulation of their water. These are extremely stressful conditions for the fish, and are completely avoidable.

There is a lot of conflicting information out there, some stating that bettas are especially tolerant of small swimming spaces and poor water conditions, while some maintain that their tolerance is barely different from other tropical fish of the same size.

Regardless, their volume of water is disproportionately small compared to the recommended tank size of a similarly sized fish (4-5 gallons), and maintains an entire lack of water quality control, causing many of these fish to be purchased with preventable diseases.

Even feeder fish are often kept in large tanks with the same level of maintenance and care as any of the other fish.

I cannot think of any reason why the selling and distribution of these betta cups should not be considered animal cruelty. But with this practice being so universal, even in pet stores dedicated to fish, I'd like to hear from the other side.

I remember a quote which roughly stated that one of the few things a democracy cannot allow is the breaking apart of a country by democratic means, because if this happens every time the people disagree, you will be left with a scramble of small, weak nations, vulnerable to attack from strong dictators. I'll explain my thinking a little more.

I believe that the ideal future for Europe (and the world) is one without borders where all of humanity is united. I know this sounds dreamy and unrealistic, but nonetheless it should be another distant goal we all slowly work towards. This means that we should be joining countries together, not separating them. At the moment, it is far easier to accomplish the breaking apart of a country, as shown in Europe's recent close calls with countries such as Scotland and Catalonia. Aside from a few exceptions, the energy for uniting countries is almost completely gone. The glowing optimism of the 90s where Europe seemed on the path to unification in a United States of Europe has gone (I am aware only a small minority shared this optimism). If we want to return to this forward-looking mindset, we must prevent secessionist movements at all costs, as they are a selfish steps backwards. If we can't learn to work together and see past differences in a small country, there is no way we can learn to work together as a united Europe, leaving us doomed for the future in competing against huge nations such as China. While it may seem unkind and dictatorial to force people to remain in a country they don't wish to belong to, it is the only way to keep Europe strong and united, a much more important goal in my opinion. The acceptance or recognition of separatist movements in Europe only encourages others to follow, hence why Spain has nervously remained silent on Kosovo.

One of the biggest threats to Europe, and therefore democracy, is Vladimir Putin. He is losing economically to the west, and so has no choice but to undermine Europe by other means, such as supporting nationalist movements. The alt-right wave in Europe and Brexit has been Putin's wet dream, because it means a weaker and more fractured Europe. If the dream of a united Europe is not enough to make the case for keeping countries together, surely the serious security threat of Russia is? Putin is fighting a battle we don't realise we're in.

I'm open to having my view changed, because I understand that my view is a result of my privilege in being part of the dominant group of my country, England. My view might be different If I were Scottish or Catalonian, and so I am interested in the counter-arguments of people who can sympathise with secessionist movements like these. I would also be interested to hear how these movements can be justified in the long term in the context of the whole of Europe.

If they want help, then they should be able to receive it. But if they don't want help, then they shouldn't be forced help [giving medication without consent for example] or stopped from hurting themselves unless they don't have the capacity to make decisions by themselves. It's kind of like natural selection. You can argue that people who are physically ill with things like cancer get treatment, but my point is most people who have physical terminal illnesses do not 'choose' to die. On the other hand, I feel as though someone with capacity can make the decision to live or die. This goes to anyone - whether they are in great pain because of a physical illness, or they are suffering emotionally from a mental illness. Kind of like euthanasia I suppose, but for anyone who can has the capacity to make informed decisions. Honestly, I don't like the fact I have this opinion, but I still believe in it.

While cooking the maps in a way that disenfranchises minority groups is currently illegal, doing it for a political advantage shouldn't be allowed either, and the maps could easily be confirmed in the same way they are already, by being checked by the supreme court. In my opinion Gerrymandering is a corrupt, ridiculous, and clearly immoral loophole that those in power keep their power regardless of what the people actually want. As it currently is, only about 75 of the 435 House districts are actually competitive. If districts were drawn in a regular shape based purely on getting equal population in each district, rather than the weird salamander shaped districts we have now, the US democracy would be more democratic and the House of Representatives would be a more accurate representation of the population.

I believe it would make a lot more sense if a politician was him/her own self with his/her own ideas instead of having to choose one of two political parties. The fact that we only really have two major political parties is ridiculous. The entire concept of it doesn't make sense. If you put people in groups according to their ideas, each group member would pretty much be a clone of the other, if not close to it. It seems because of this there isn't much middle ground in politicians, you either have a republican who believes in X or a democrat who believes in Y. With a system like that it just doesn't seem any innovation or new ideas would come through like they could. But not only that, when you put a bunch of people in one group the people will end up doing what is best for that group (party) and not necessarily what they think is right, or want to do.

Those who have compelling evidence against them should be able to be transferred stateside and their charges should withstand due process; those, if any, who do not have compelling evidence against them may, and probably should, be released, and if the price of reinstating rule of law is that a few tens of terrorists wind up going free, then so be it.

It has always seemed to me that the main purpose of Guantanamo was to use the loophole of being outside US territory to maintain ethically shady imprisonments, and this has been a boon to the terrorist narrative.

Edit: With credit to /u/aduis for bringing it up: we can only reasonably believe that a prisoner is actually a terrorist in the presence of evidence. Insofar as opaque tribunals use ""secret evidence"" to select or convict detainees, we the public have no idea who is actually being detained, and rely entirely on institutional trust to believe that the process has a high degree of accuracy in containing dangerous people.

Deltas awarded:

-Prisoners may indeed have legal protections. The article linked was from 2005, though.

-The propaganda war may work the other way: we may be made to look weak by closing it. I don't think this is the more likely outcome, but it is plausible that whatever we do will be twisted to make us look bad.

For example, any attempt we make at stopping the extinction of a species, saving a rainforest or stitching up the ozone is only necessary because of mistakes we made in the past. I understand many species have died out through no interaction with humans, but i'm saying we certainly don't help the situation and as far as I know haven't been the sole cause of a species survival. Anything we do to better our selves eg ending poverty or generally expanding our knowledge of the universe would be completely pointless if we didn't exist.      

I guess this is all because we are top of the food chain, we serve no purpose to any other life other than our own."	3	7

This has allowed us to dominate worldwide in spreading our culture, advancing our military goals, and leading in economic prosperity (Maybe not per capita, but still).  Besides a few areas of STEM (I'm looking at you, Math) the only language you really need to know for science is English.

Now, China has been increasingly investing in science funding and nurturing science talent from within.  There are also many academics moving to China in search of academic or research jobs.  While current Chinese science includes a large amount of low-quality work, their share of high-quality work has increased dramatically.  

China also has improved investment in many up-and-coming fields, such as AI, high-speed computing, and Genomics.  They attempt to compete with the U.S. on several military technologies, such as hyper sonic ballistics, and high-speed submarines.  Their government-level control allows them to more easily maintain high scientific throughput provided they attain it and the government stays science-friendly.

With the decaying interest in Science and the undercurrent of anti-science sentiment in the U.S. contributes to China's efforts to become a leader in Science.   Thus I feel that:

1. Chinese science is advancing at a rapid rate in many emerging technologies.
2. Chinese dominance in some of these technologies is likely, due to increased population and a STEM-positive government.
3. The decaying U.S. interest in Science and anti-science sentiment in the U.S. contributes to a slow, but increasing brain drain to China.
4. The increase of Chinese as a language to publish important papers is a significant possibility, despite not being particularly high.  If this shift occurs, the U.S. will encounter a significant setback in science leadership.
5. Science or Technology leadership in China allows them to dominate economically and militarily.
6. A tighter government control in China allows STEM-friendly politicians to maintain a STEM dominance.
7. The threat is actionable, in that government science funding can stave off Chinese domination and lower brain-drain.  Furthermore, the U.S. culture can adapt to fit more science (like during the space race) which can be encouraged by a popular president.
8. There does not exist another threat to the U.S. hegemony that is as actionable as countering Chinese STEM development by improving ours.

The only other opposition I've ever heard is a religious opposition, but there are never any reasons given.

Stannis is stubborn, obsessed with his biased sense of ""justice"", absolutely horrible at maintaining any kind of good relationship with anyone, fails at any kind of intrigue (not involving shadow babies), and suffers from massive reality distortion field which gets him into fights he cannot win.

Stannis could make the best of his situation backing Renly, who would then together with Robb crush Lannisters from all sides. He would then be Renly's heir, and Renly doesn't have terribly great chances of having children. Instead he chose the way of evil magic and became a kinslayer.

Even his reputation as military commander is inflated. He barely survived one siege, won one easy battle against Ironborn, then lost pretty much everything else.

I expect the realm under Stannis would most likely fall apart in a few years. The people would never accept him, not only because of his horrible personality, but also due to his believe in a foreign god to whom he makes human sacrifices.

If someone is upset with me saying ""nigga"" they should be upset with me also saying ""n-word"" too. And if they're fine with n-word they should be fine with nigga.


I have the same issue with censoring I guess. It's unreasonable to say ""f-word"" instead of ""fuck"" when the person I'm talking to already has heard the word ""fuck"" before. (except when talking to kids because they likely never heard the word before)

* [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/us/san-francisco-nra-terrorist.html) 

* [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/san-francisco-board-brands-nra-a-domestic-terrorist-organization)

* [WaPo](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/09/04/san-francisco-just-passed-resolution-calling-nra-domestic-terrorist-organization/)

According to wikipedia, domestic terrorism is 

&gt;Under current United States law, set forth in the USA PATRIOT Act, acts of domestic terrorism are those which: ""(A) involve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State; (B) appear to be intended – (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and (C) occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.""[2] [3] [4] This definition is made for the purposes of authorizing law enforcement investigations. While international terrorism (""acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries"") is a defined crime in federal law,[5] no federal criminal offense exists which is referred to as ""domestic terrorism"". Acts of domestic terrorism are charged under specific laws, such as killing federal agents or ""attempting to use explosives to destroy a building in interstate commerce"".[6]

To my knowledge, the NRA has not violated (A) and therefore could not violate (B).  This also makes (C) irrelevant.  The [NRA commercial featuring Dana Loesch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bBQq9GdeKI) is the closest I can get to something resembling terrorism and even then, it's an attempt at recruitment, not actually committing any acts that would fall under the definition above.  Some may call them stochiastic terrorists, but that's not what SF did, and to my knowledge, there aren't any laws governing that either.

I'm not overly familiar with the NRA in general and have only gleaned tidbits about election interference and funneling of money from Russia through them from news articles around the Mueller probe.  Unless those are relevant to the topic of ""domestic terrorism"", those allegations shouldn't really come up here though.  I am left leaning, not a gun owner or advocate, but have relatives who are and are members of the NRA.  Regardless, I do not think the NRA fits the bill for a ""domestic terrorism organization"" and largely agree with the NRA that this is a political stunt by SF, but I'm open to seeing it either way."	63	102

For example, if it's fine for a baby girl to have the middle name ""O'Hare,"" or ""Smith,"" then there's nothing wrong with the middle name being ""James"" or ""Gordon."" 

I believe this because middle names are used to incorporate meaningful associations into a child's name, and it already isn't strictly necessary for them to be feminine or otherwise gendered.

I'm speaking specifically about the tradition of middle names as employed in North America. 

To be clear, I'm only talking about giving masculine middle names to girls.  I'm not arguing for the acceptability of giving a boy the middle name ""Elizabeth.""

Most of these services last typically between 1-3 years and are for men aged 18-35 though every country is slightly different (Israel for example has 32 months of mandatory service for men and 24 months for women). Additionally exemptions or deferments are typically available for any number of reasons such as being a student, physical requirement, health, and even payment.

As the US already has the selective service that fundamentally it would be easiest for the boys/men to be subjected to mandatory military service requirements from a logistical standpoint. While this may be initially extremely unpopular and logistically require an upscaling of a lot of the military chains and facilities - I believe that when the dust has settled there will be more benefit from having a mandatory military service as part of the American cultural zeitgeist.

For example, I believe having one would instill a much greater sense of civic duty from all participants which would eventually be reflected in society. Additionally, wholesale military participation would do wonders for giving citizens, especially younger ones, a sense of competency along with self-actualization.  The physical health benefits would also be seen across the board. The combination from both of these aspects would be that you would have a more able and capable citizen pool, such as one sees from things like the peace corp. This could be tapped for projects such as domestic infrastructure such as a domestic peace corp.

From a cultural standpoint with more people having exeperienced military training, there would be a lot more exposure of people from different parts of the country to one another which would be able to lessen the polarization of the population.  Additionally, having had skin in the game the hope would be that eventually you would see a reduction in chickenhawking. Additionally, with more and more people having been raised in a regimented discipline structure hopefully less delinquency would result, especially from boys who grow up in the not best of situations.  On that note giving people the opportunity to choose being a soldier as a profession would be an eye opener for a lot of youths whom otherwise would not have good outcomes in life.

I am more than willing to hear what ramifications are not being considered for why a net benefit would not be the case."	0	212	0.34

Thomas Jefferson believed it was not enough to leave politics up to those we vote in, rather he believed that the people should have an educated and informed opinion about the state of our current environment.

We the people have the ability to give individuals the power to dictate our rights and societal norms. So, when a candidate who has different beliefs gets elected and decides to make changes that directly impacts your life, you probably won't like it and will feel unrepresented in office, or even oppressed.

I've had many conversations that sounded like this, ""I like this [third party candidate], but they won't win because one of these two will likely get elected because of the party they represent.""

So, thinking that, that candidate gets less votes. It's like saying, ""well the class gets to vote for pizza, ice cream, or popcorn during our movie, and I'm allergic to dairy, but I'd rather have pizza over ice cream even though I really like popcorn"". You don't really agree with either option, but you'd rather suffer the lesser of two evils.

Too many people vote like this and it not only ensures that your candidate won't win, but it also gives the people you don't like more votes.

It is not about the party, it's about the individual and if you believe they would represent you. And, it's always nice to think of others when you vote, but overall it should be equal representation in the media for all candidates with less name-calling bigotry and more facts than opinion.

Vote for whoever you want, but it should be for WHO you want, not the bandwagons.

At the same time, they promote the notion of polite company.  They say that one should not speak of matters of politics at the dinner table because it may lead to offending someone and that such matters are best left for different places and times.

That seems incredibly hypcritical to me.  If you are against political correctness and the notion of safe spaces, then you should be 100% okay with talking about finances, politics, and religion at the dinner table.

Assuming this is not merely a threat and in fact a course of action they plan to take, this seems like bad political calculus. In my mind, this is starkly against the interests of any left of center person. In a FPTP system, the two largest parties are the only viable candidates. It behooves anyone interested in either making positive change and/or preventing greater harm to vote for the candidate who is more aligned with their policy interests, lest they cede that opportunity to influence the outcome of the election positively.

Federal policy, namely in regards for foreign affairs, is directly shaped by the executive, of which this vote will be highly consequential. There's strong reason to believe Trump would be far less sympathetic to the Palestinian cause than Biden, ergo if this is an issue you're passionate about, Biden stands to better represent your interest.

To change my view, I would need some competing understanding of electoral politics or the candidates that could produce a calculus to how not voting for Biden could lead to a preferable outcome from a left leaning perspective. To clarify, I am talking about the general election and not a primary. Frankly you can go ham in the primary, godspeed.

To assist, while I wouldn't dismiss anything outright, the following points are ones I would have a really hard time buying into:

- Accelerationism
- Both parties are the same or insufficiently different
- Third parties are viable in the general election"	1615	1597	0.74

So I'm actually open to be persuaded here.

OK, so the claim is that we should be governed by specifically trained scientists. So we should have a finances expert as finance minister, some international relations experts for foreign affairs, some sociologists and so on and so on. These people would be there to make proposals for efficient solutions to whatever problems we have. Why would an elected official know better?

One problem would obviously be that scientists can't decide what the state *should* do, but only what the efficient means would be to reach the set goals. And I know, ethicists don't ever agree on anything, but still they are probably a better shot than the random idiot who would get democratically elected. So let's just have some committee of trained ethicists that deliberate about the overall goals, and then the scientists jump in and provide the means to the ends.

I'm not saying this would solve all problems or that it would even be the perfect government, but I can't see how elected officials are better suited for their job than some experts. So why is democracy better than this kind of expert government? Change my view!"	184	202

So, if you come to CMV a lot you’ve probably noticed that there are a LOT of posts about transgenderism and gender identity in general. And if you are like me then you just scroll on past those posts and look for something else and think to yourself, “why are people even talking about this?”

Before I explain myself, let me give a quick disclaimer. I know very little about gender identity. Please, take the time to educate me on what I’m missing out on and please do not attack me if I get something wrong. I’m not trying to troll anyone here and I mean no disrespect. 

OK, so having said that, here is how I see and understand things. I completely get it that transitioning from the gender assigned at birth to the gender one identifies with must be a major moment, like the defining moment, in a person’s life. And I completely get it that this must be agonizing and traumatic for a lot of people because society is not entirely on board with the idea of transgenderism. 

Therefore, I can see why it’s really important for people who are transitioning to tell their friends and family and to expect their loved ones to support them. I can also see how the very closest people: parents, children, spouses, might need some time to adjust. They should and they must, but it’s not hard to imagine that it would be difficult for them. To me anyway. Like if my mother told me that she had been living a lie all her life and she was always a man, I would absolutely need some time to process that information. I would be shocked and even a bit upset. But, of course I would still love my mother! Nothing could ever change that. 

Beyond that, I imagine that most people would need to inform their coworkers and/or classmates of their transition. And I could see how that also might not be easy. But pretty much all workplaces and schools in the U.S. have anti-harassment and anti-bullying codes so, if your peers have a huge problem with it, they’ll need to keep their mouths shut. The onus is on the bigot to get in step with society, not the other way around. 

So, I understand that this process of transitioning is very delicate for the transitioning person and the people close to them but apart from that, why is this something for society at large to talking about? What does any of this have to do with the rest of us? I’m not really even sure if I understand why people who identify as trans feel the need to tell the whole world about it. I’m not against it, but it seems rather illogical to me. If you are presenting as a gender that is not the one you were assigned to at birth, isn’t that enough? Is there a reason to tell people that you do not even know that you were born with a different biological sex? Let me explain what I mean by contrasting with the gay rights movement. 

Gay rights really needed to be pushed and promoted (and still needs to be in much of the world) because gay people needed the right to be open about their relationships without fear of being mocked, ostracized and even attacked. And obviously, laws needed to be rewritten, particularly marriage laws, to legitimize their bonds. In other words, gay people needed all of society, strangers included, to get on board with their lifestyle. And while there are some obvious hold outs, American society and Western society in general was able to accept gay relationships really quickly! Bravo! 

I sincerely hope that we do the same with transgenderism and, to be honest, it seems much more simple than it was to achieve rights for gay people. I mean, if a person presents themself as a woman or a man, it’s pretty obvious. I almost never encounter a person whose gender I cannot determine and if I do I certainly don’t tell that person! So, how hard is it to just say to yourself, “this person is clearly a woman, I should address her accordingly.” Isn’t that what everyone does already? Has anyone here ever heard anyone say “You’re not really a woman! I’ll bet you’re biologically male! Take your pants off an prove it!”? I don’t think that ever happens.  

So, what’s the issue? I hear a lot of noise about restrooms but seriously, why? When I go into a public restroom, I’m usually laser focused on pooping and peeing. I find public restrooms rather unpleasant and I’m pretty sure I’m not alone in that. Therefore, if someone walks in who is clearly displaying the social markers that indicate being male, I’m not going to give that person a second thought and I’m certainly not going to turn the bathroom into the Spanish Inquisition and try to figure out what their biological sex is. If someone were to walk in wearing a dress, I’d be a little taken aback for sure, but I wouldn’t attack this person. And if that person is in a dress, wouldn’t they feel more comfortable in the women’s room? Again, not trying to hurt feelings, but this seems rather easy to me. 

Another thing that you see a lot is talk about sports. Specifically, locker rooms and whether or not people who were born male should be able to compete in female sports. 

Here’s what I think about that: If you’re changing in front of a lot of women and a penis comes out, that’s going to cause quite a stir. Does anybody really have trouble understanding that? But, I would suspect, that people who identify as women but are still biologically male are not going to be so open about displaying their genitals in a group setting like that. So, I don’t really think this is a big problem.

As far as biologically male trans athletes go, I’m a bit conflicted, but I really feel that unless we’re talking about competitions at the very highest levels, it really shouldn’t matter. If we were to see a sudden influx of women who were biologically male at birth dominating women’s tennis, swimming, track and field, etc., we might need to revisit this topic but, for now, just let people do what they’re comfortable with. 

Just let people do what they’re comfortable with, people! What’s the big issue about this? I don’t see why it has been getting so much attention lately. It’s really nobody’s business but the person who’s transitioning and a few people around them. Can anyone explain to me why this is something that requires a huge national conversation?"	0	57	0.5

Games with loot boxes must disclose the odds for unlocking rewards. I think this is a positive development that will at least increase transparency. It will encourage game devs to seek out more ethical monetization opportunities. It will positively impact the rest of the game industry by making it a *little* less lucrative to put loot boxes in their games, since basically devs will now be forced to disclose a part of their business model to competitors (and everyone else).

Apps that are selling ICOs and crypto futures must now be affiliated with a pre-approved financial institution. Apple has similar guidelines for other financial trading apps, and this will reduce the risk of people falling for scams.

VPNs must now disclose what kind of data they collect from users. This gives people enough information to avoid sketchy VPNs and discourages predatory data collection practices. It increases trust in good VPNs and encourages people to use those.

All of these, I think are positive developments. Yes, it's all a semi-walled garden, but you might as well protect the people staying in the garden. CMV?

My explaination for my view is explained below.

My first point is the teachings are mainly focused on positive thoughts rather than negative thoughts. Bhuddism teaches its followers to think positively and encourages its followers to do good deeds for the better of others and yourself, this would make people's mindset more meaningful and change their life in a good way. Whereas in other religions such as Christianity, the followers are teached about sins and their consequences and it would make their followers fear the consequences rather than living a free life and be enlighted.

My second point is that all the main points in other religions are simplified into 5 simple precepts: absence from alcoholism, absence from theft, absence from lying, absence from sexual misconduct, absence from drugs. This makes the teachings much easier to understand and easier to follow. This would prepare the followers to a brighter mind and a good mindset.

These are my two points that I have to support my opinion and there might be more points as more points emerges from the comments"	0	39

CMV	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1l7ccx/i_think_nonprofessional_athletes_should_be_able/	"Why do I bring this up? Johnny Manziel. If you're unfamiliar with who that is, he's the quarterback for the Texas A&amp;M college football team, The Aggies. [Here](http://www.sportsgrid.com/ncaa-football/johnny-manziel-football-autograph-paid-suspension-rule-texas-am-aggies/) is what I'm talking about.


It makes absolutely no sense why he can't sell jerseys, shirts, etc. with his signature. Why is it that I (a nobody) could legally sell a hat I signed, if someone wanted to buy it? 

I agree that these kids shouldn't be paid to play college sports, but it seems to me that it would actually benefit the school if they allowed this. For one, they would probably have students paying them large amounts of money to pay off their classes and other school expenses. Two, it's just more shit with their school logo on it. They'd benefit how any team does with getting more merch out. And three, (which is pretty similar to #2) players would be able to sell more than the school could . Let me clarify: if Johnny Manziel bought 100+ hats, shirts, jerseys, gloves, whatever, and signed them all, they'd sell like burgers at mcdonalds. My point is, A&amp;M would have just easily sold 500 or more items without lifting a finger, JM did it for them. 

I know there must be a side I'm not seeing to this, so please cmv

Edit: I should add that I only know it's like this for football. If it isn't like this for other sports, then sorry I sound stupid"	8	24

In NYC, there are a few elite public high schools that only admit students based on a standardized exam.  Currently, Asians, mostly from poorer immigrant families, are vastly over represented (at Stuyvesant, Asians constitute over 70% of the student body) at these schools.  

Mayor DeBlasio wants to increase the percentage of black and Latino students at these elite schools:

&gt;""In an essay for the education news website Chalkbeat, de Blasio wrote, ""Right now, we are living with monumental injustice. The prestigious high schools make 5,000 admissions offers to incoming ninth-graders. Yet, this year just 172 black students and 298 Latino students received offers. This happened in a city where two out of every three eighth-graders in our public schools are Latino or black. There’s also a geographic problem. There are almost 600 middle schools citywide. Yet, half the students admitted to the specialized high schools last year came from just 21 of those schools. For a perfect illustration of disparity: Just 14 percent of students at Bronx Science come from the Bronx. Can anyone defend this? Can anyone look the parent of a Latino or black child in the eye and tell them their precious daughter or son has an equal chance to get into one of their city’s best high schools? Can anyone say this is the America we signed up for?""

- Because many of the current students are low income (Thirty-four percent are eligible for free lunch and another 12 percent are eligible for reduced-price lunches), I don't think it is fair for the large number of of similar Asian students to not be able to attend the elite public schools to make room for the black and Latino students who did not score as well on the exams. 

-  However, I do not think such unfairness is that harmful to the excluded Asian students, virtually all of whom will likely still succeed by attending other high schools and working hard.  Further, I think having a more integrated racial environment is beneficial for all of the students at those schools - right now, I think there may be too much of a focus on just STEM, particularly at Stuyvesant.

Being convicted of a felony is basically a life sentence for the convicted (especially if they're black). Those convicted lose a lot of employment opportunities so if someone who sold drugs to make ends meet gets convicted as a felon and they want to get clean after they're released they can't get a job so they go back to selling drugs for their lively hood, and prisons in America only damage criminals psychologically more and doesn't help them to rehabilitate into better citizens, it only makes more hardened criminals when they're released. In Norway they rehabilitate everyone who commits a crime whether it's rather small like petty theft or the most evil of acts like murder, rape, and pedophilia, and a lot of us in the west criticize them for being too soft on these awful crimes but Norway has one of the lowest recidivism rates in the world at 20%. The USA has one of the highest recidivism rates at 76.6%. Obviously punishing criminals doesn't work, so maybe it's time to stop hurting the criminals further and to instead help them. If someone has any evidence to support that rehabilitation doesn't work then I'm all ears.

And nobody seems to like people who are visibly arrogant. Which is ironic, given that the more you think about it, pretty much everyone is arrogant. Some are just better at disguising it, making it seem like modest self-confidence, etc. But really people are notably arrogant, confident that no matter what their worldview is, they are correct and everyone else is wrong.

My argument is, arrogance is natural. Embracing it as such is a lot better for you mentally. The best solution is to embrace your arrogance, but don't let it show. Appear modest and open-minded. This is the best way to actually get what you want out of life. You have the confidence necessary to obtain success, and you make friends because you don't *seem* arrogant.

But failing to accept the fact that individuals are naturally arrogant doesn't do you any good. Just look at how proud people are of their weaknesses, strengths, literally everything about them. If they are not interested in something they are proud of it. We can hardly do or think anything without being proud of what it says about us as individuals. So we should all just embrace our arrogance, in my opinion.

Change my view.

Edit: I think I was incorrect to use the word ""arrogance"", since I seem to have a different understanding of the word than most people. I would call most confidence ""arrogance"", if only because I think it is impossible to be confident without being arrogant. I will rethink my position more and clarify my thoughts, then maybe post an amendment sometime in the future. My point is that I think it is okay for people to regard themselves as ""special"", and to be proud of themselves, even when it is in excess. But I will make my thoughts more cohesive before furthering my debate."	0	40	0.29

They're so often emphasized as the biggest reason for mass incarceration in America, but that just doesn't make sense since less than 10% of prisons are for profit.

A lot of the rhetoric surrounding private prisons seems to be mostly speculation or exaggeration (ex: Prison profiteers lobby for putting law-abiding citizens in jail). 

Many people talk about how this must be true because of minimum capacities in private prisons that motivate governments to arrest more people or implement or support frivolous laws such as drug illegalization, but I haven't seen any explicit evidence of minimum capacities, or any evidence that the private prisons are suffering such a shortage of prisoners to meet their supposed quotas that lobbying for an increase in arrests would even be necessary.

It just seems incredibly overblown and purported as essentially the #1 cause of mass incarceration rates and America's prison system on Reddit when they make up a relatively small portion of the prisons in America.

CMV.	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1h902o/i_believe_iran_has_the_right_to_create_nuclear/	"The Western media, especially the American media, talks a lot about the threat of a nuclear armed Iran. The discussion generally centres around the ways in which Iran's nuclear capabilities can be stopped and works on the assumption that firstly, a nuclear armed Iran would be dangerous and that it shouldn't be allowed nuclear weapons. 

Firstly, I'd contest that a nuclear armed Iran would be dangerous to the West. Combined, the West has substantially more nuclear weapons than Iran could  hope to possess. There's no threat of Iran firing these weapons at a Western country because the result would be either the decimation of Iran through a nuclear retaliation or a land invasion that would destroy and cripple the nation. If North Korea won't use it's nuclear stockpiles, I'd say it's safe to say Iran won't. 

Secondly, I don't think the West is in a position to deny Iran nuclear weapons given the amount the West possesses. Given the fact that America has shown it is willing to militarily intervene in the middle east and even invade whole countries, a country on Iran's border, it is fair for the Iranians to want a deterrent. 

The fear of Iran in the west is unjustified and while the West keeps it's stockpiles of nuclear weapons and continues to operate so openly in the middle east is fair and expected for the countries therein to create deterrents to Western attack.

I think a lot of people default to a weird state of self pity, giving up and misanthropy instead of admitting they never made any actual effort to learn how to socialize in a civilised and nice manner.

I get that for some of us its harder than for others, I used to be extremely shy and introverted, but I worked on myself and went into uncomfortable social situations until my brain learned how to handle it and I become more charismatic.
It makes me sad to see how many people on the internet complain that they are seemingly incapable of having fun in social situations by nature, but never make any effort to improve their charisma and personality.

I'm hoping to get input on the principles involved, so I'd like to use a different example, one that hopefully will get at the essence of my current view.

So let's say we're talking about a heterosexual mixed-race couple, in particular, black person + white person.

On the face of it, I would say that a business definitely has the right to discriminate in any arbitrary way, whether because of the mixed marriage, or even just because the owner decides that the bride is too ugly.

But if I dig down, I start to see problems. First, I can imagine a community where everyone agrees that if anyone is going to sell their house or rent out their apartment, they will not sell or rent to any mixed-race couples. Second, I can imagine a community where everyone gets together with all the businesses, and agrees that no one will do business with any mixed-race couples. I can also imagine a community where everyone gets together to bully the businesses to do it, but maybe that's less likely, I don't know.

I've asked a few people what they think about this, and one answer I've heard has been along the lines of, ""The market will take care of that. People who disapprove of those businesses will boycott them, and the businesses will be forced to behave better."" But I'm talking about businesses in communities that approve of it, so no one would boycott. Also, I don't see the market solving the problem where no one will sell or rent to a mixed-race couple.

Another answer I've heard is that the mixed-race couple could simply choose not to live in that community. I worry that this answer forgets that there are a lot of really poor people who don't have the luxury of choosing their community. Also, I worry that a community that would discriminate like this would tend to be increasingly insular over the years, increasingly hostile to a wider range of ""undesirables"" -- today, mixed-race couples, tomorrow, Hindus, next day, Justin Bieber fans. And it seems like the people who could just move to another community might be inclined to move to their own insular communities. It seems like it would be bad for society to have closed pockets like this.

I'm bothered by the idea of forcing people to live next door to someone they disapprove of, but it seems that we've made a lot of progress by forcing people to go to school with, and share water fountains with, etc, people they disapprove of. It seems like we owe it to each other to figure out how to live together.

That's my view. I am pretty sure it's naive. I'd like to get thoughts on expanding it.

I think it should be on the same level as the word ""bitch"". Bitch is a pejorative term for a female but it can be used as an empowering word for a strong woman. In fact, many women take pride on using the word bitch.

Without making slut and whore pejorative terms, slut and whore means someone who enjoys sex liberally. That doesn't sound too bad at all to be honest. Sex is good as long it's safe.

https://youtu.be/SHLHkmWoYDU

**Rationale:**

America pretty much lost the Iraq war. Sure they got rid of Saddam, but they didnt subdue the militant Islamists and ex-Iraqi army militias at all. Once they left Isis had the strength to not only conquer large swathes of Iraq, but the middle east proper.

America has 7x the population of Iraq and something like 10x the guns, plus a populace with a ludicrously high rate of firearm profficiency.

Add to that the radically different levels of desertion, and more importantly sabotage. You think fragging was bad in Nam, see what happens when you invade Texas lmfao.

Add to that the logistical nightmare that is protecting US infrastructure, literally 10s of millions of unguardable targets, and the whole thing starts looking unwinnable for the government very fucking fast.  US geography is also an extremely daunting challenge with regards to suppressing rebellion.

Then there is the foreign actor concern. Allies would put pressure on to stop the killing of civilians (which would be a necessary collateral outcome of fighting your own people). Enemies would gleefully support the rebels in any way they could as hard as they could.

The government would never fucking glass its own territory and people with nukes, its fucking ridiculous to suggest such a thing. Even conventional bombing would be asking to feed into desertion and further rebellion. 

Not wanting to invade due to a rifle behind every blade of grass isnt just something for foreign armies to ponder.

American citizens should be sickened by his words here, they are deeply unAmerican and downright terrifying to be coming from the top executive in the land.

**Bonus CMV:** 

Biden is straight up lying about the 'types of weapons' claim, you could absolutely own cannons as a private citizen. ~~Privateers~~ Merchant vessels used them all the time and 2A allowed for their legal ownership.

**Tl:dr**

2A practically ensures the US populace a reasonable if not favored chance against their own government. Not many countries can say that, and none of them have a military as daunting as the yanks. Biden's cute little comment was pure unadulterated bluff.

**Edit 1:** gee whiz its hard to run so many arguments at once. I should have done this with access to my pc instead of just my shitty phone with a cracked screen. I apologise to anybody left waiting, im trying to answer as quickly as possible, im literally sweating!

**Edit 2:** use of the Iraq war as example was just that. Whether that war counted as victory or defeat is not all that relevant to my opinion here, my point was just that the insurgent population was never subdued despite the overwhelming technological advantage wielded by the US military. The Taliban or viet kong might have been better to go with, but thats not exactly comparable because they are militaries themselves at the end of the day.

**Edit 3:** I will add one argument. The top US military brass have said on many occassions that they are beholden to the constitution first and foremost. I tend to take them at their word, they generally seem like very principled and proud individuals willing to do anything necessary to uphold their oath. That means the President cant just decide to glass entire cities or States that contain innocent civilians in amongst an insurgency or guerilla network.

**Edit 4:** I think many here are failing to appreciate the ticking clock the government would be put under during a popular uprising, especially if many people stopped working and paying taxes. The US military is insanely expensive, an insurgency is very cheap. As the Taliban say: 'you have the watches, we have the time'.

**Edit 5:** i have a filthy, filthy secret to admit to. Im actually an Aussie, its 2:30am here now and after frantically replying as fast as I can for hours I must retire for the night. I have a deep love of the concept of a citizen's right to bear arms and am extremely jealous of you guys' ability to do so. I curse Martin Bryant regularly for his part in giving the Howard government the excuse to strip us of the majority of our gun rights. Due to this I have spent a good amount of time researching the meaning and history of 2a (although im far from an expert as you can see) and was therefore vicariously offended by Biden's flagrant misrepresentation of your right to self defense and its implications. I will be answering everything I can when I wake up and handing out any appropriate deltas.

**Edit 6:** I accidently handed out one delta based on the definition of privateer and am not sure if it persists after an edit or not. Apologies to the mod if I stuffed up the delta log. Thank you all for your thoughtful responses! Goodnight cunts!

**Edit 7:** Im back. Another argument prosuced through discussion: there are 19 million veterans among the US population. Sure many are older, but many are still capable of fighting. In comparison active duty is only 1.4 million, with most of them being administrative. Ill have to be a little terse to work through everyone. Today Im mainly looking at deltas where they belong.

**edit 8**: reading through the answers I think most people are missing the scale of things. The US military is massive, but the US population dwarfs it. There are 10 cities in the US with more than a million, there are 350 million people, the aforementioned 19 million vets, tens of millions of infrastructure points, ~3000 miles to cover from LA to NY. The military cant be everywhere at once, even with what would remain of the national guard after desertion is factored in.

**Conclusion**: I think my mind has been sufficiently changed in that although Biden's comments were both wrong and also horrendously innapropriate to be coming from the President, its all a bit moot at the end of the day. My conclusion can be most accurately summarised by a delta comment ive given out:

&gt; I think this is a fair middle ground. Biden was so far off the mark with regards to the framing of things that arguing either for or against his isolated claim about military hardware is missing the forest for the trees. I would say a popular uprising against a truly tyrannical set of actions by the executive would likely be successful, but thats more because of the fact the US top brass would likely drag him out by the hair and throw him to the mob themselves, so again, civilain hardware is moot. 

&gt; In his (kind of) defense, I think as demonstrated by his lack of ability to finish several sentences coherently, he is not exactly in what I would call a lucid and rational headspace. I think the dems would be well served to limit his public speaking engagements to be both less frequent and more terse in the future.

Thanks to everyone who gave thoughtful responses. I will go through replies to my return questions to some people, as I think many were almost at a delta-able level of persuasiveness, when I have time. Cheers ya bloody pack of Seppo bastards!"	1799	722	0.86

A post pandemic economy will be the ultimate stress test of our nation and our poorly managed fiat system.	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/g4ic4r/cmv_nixon_republican_macroeconomic_myopia_set_us/	"You can actually [see exactly where we made a wrong turn](https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/3rdparty/2011/6/skill1.png) when you look at the [graphs and data](http://www.stateoftheusa.org/content/measuring-economic-well-being.php). Median male income was lockstep with real gdp per capita until 1973. Policy makers were freaking out. It was a wild time to be alive.

&amp;nbsp;

Yes there was war spending, an oil embargo, and costs from Johnson's ""Great Society"" legislation to complicate things at that time, but we had already been in crisis nearly a decade by that point; 1973 was right in the middle of ""The Great Inflation"" where rates had been ratcheting up since the mid 60's and wouldn't stop until they peaked at 14% in 1980.

&amp;nbsp;

It's no coincidence that our economy went off the rails in 72/73. Nixon had his come to Jesus moment with [Connally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Connally) at Camp David on the 13th of August '71, and by the 15th he ordered the gold window closed. Their solution was to kill Bretton Woods and move to an entirely fiat system. That same day he issued a 90 day freeze on all wages and prices via executive order 11615 (under the [Economic Stabilization Act of 1970](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Stabilization_Act_of_1970)) plus a 10% import surcharge. Such drastic measures required he go on national TV that same night to ease concerned Americans and to ""lay to rest the bugaboo of devaluation"" as he said it. This became known as The Nixon Shock.

&amp;nbsp;

Understandably, the other IMF and World Bank nations were panicked by this and so they tried to save their long standing international arrangement a few months later with The Smithsonian Agreement, which devalued the US dollar by 8.5% to $38 per ounce, [the net effect of which was actually a 10.7% devaluation against other key currencies.](https://books.google.com/books/about/Strained_Relations.html?id=sTgyBgAAQBAJ) It was too late though. By 1973 Bretton Woods was dead and all references to gold were removed statutes; the world economy was now entirely a fiat system.

&amp;nbsp;

All of this because of one critically important false assumption baked into the stabilization policy at the time: that there exists a stable link between unemployment and inflation. Essentially they thought you could ""buy"" a low unemployment rate with a bump to inflation. It was called The Phillips Curve and they chased it right off a cliff despite being [warned by experts](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w24891.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiUktn8t_ToAhXGbc0KHSWEAIcQFjABegQIARAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw3hKDfh2i05UU1W1m6lrOwZ) that doing so would cause an economic feedback loop, requiring endless inflation to maintain. Unfortunately, having a low unemployment number to tout was just too attractive for policymakers, so they made it core to their decision making.

&amp;nbsp;

Basing all economic policy on one nebulous, poorly understood, deceptively simple economic metric...sound familiar? That's because policymakers haven't learned a damn thing. Central Banks today understand they need to anchor their monetary policy with specific numeric inflation targets and a commitment to price stability. To the extent that those numerical objectives are credible, they're a good thing. Sure, it has reduced uncertainty and increased transparency, however, the fundamental problem remains the same.

&amp;nbsp;

What we're struggling with now is the result of over corrections that were made to cope with what was, and still is, the complete and total failure of American macroeconomic policy. The relentless pursuit of long-term growth and maximum employment...by people with a poor understanding of very complex systems &amp; more data than they care to look at.

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR: [The first and second laws of thermodynamics apply to economics &amp; systems that are primarily reliant on constant growth are doomed.](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/PT.3.4047)"	1	31

Lee and I plan to join the Confederacy.	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/21ydmf/cmv_i_am_col_robert_e_lee_and_i_plan_to_join_the/	"I am Robert Edward Lee; graduate of the Military Academy at West point, veteran of the war between the United States and Mexico and presently a Colonel of the United States Army.

The year of our Lord is 1861, and the day is the 18th of April.  I come to you with a question of the most grave import to my nation, my home and my conscience.

I have at this time recieved offers from both the Confederacy and the office of the President of the United States to assume commands within their respective armies.  The former I have, for the moment, ignored; while the latter has been offered presently and demands my immediate decision.  The post I have been offered is in name a defensive one: I am to take command of the defense of Washington from any southern incursion.  In principle, I cannot fault the honorable nature of such an assignment, but I truly fear that as this conflict escalates and embroils all of the country (as I believe it is destined to), I will inevitably be compelled to take up arms against the people and soil that I count as my home: the State of Virginia.

When I raised this objection to my commander and asked if I could simply abstain from the conflict, he was blunt in response: ""I have no place in my army for equivocal men.""

And so, the offer before me is of singular moment.  If I accept, I will have declared for the Union and must put the full force of my abilities to that cause. If I refuse, my decision will hold equal meaning.  To refuse is to declare for the Confederacy.

The Union of this country has been the object of my service for nearly 32 years; and I hold deep admiration and love for the nation and the ideal it embodies, but I am foremost and before all a *Virginian*.  My conscience cannot allow me to make war upon my home; no matter the reason.  To do so would be a profound betrayal of all that conspired to make me the man I am on this day and those people and places which I hold most dear.  I would join Judas, Brutus and Benedict Arnold in the lowest circle of Hell.

I am thus inclined to explicitly reject the offer of my President, and in so doing declare myself for the defense of Virginia.  I will decline the offer, resign my commission and head South.

But my conscience troubles me, and I cannot help but wonder if I am making a sound and just choice.

So please, try to change my view.

Recently I decided to stop gaming. I am not a native English speaker so bear with me.



First of all, I do believe gaming with other people (real life friends being in the same room as you) can be beneficial since you're spending time with other people doing the same thing. Still, I do believe playing board games with your friends would be better since you have an actual interaction with your friends.




Moving on, competitive gaming alone provides you with absolutely nothing. In certain cases, like people with depression, it can be helpful, an online community where the depressed person can find comfort within and sometimes even recover through gaming. But other than special cases like this. there are much better things that the ""lonely-gamer"" can do. Read a book, watch a movie, discover music, write stuff, paint, go for a walk, all of these can give much more things than competitive gaming can give. All of these can help increase imagination, make you think another way, increase your real-life skills, make you productive, boost your confidence. On the other hand competitive video-gaming alone makes you anxious, makes you more angry, and it is not productive. You completely waste your time and there's almost no pros, technically your reaction speeds get better and it can help you if you suffer from depression. But those benefits don't compare to the benefits that come with real life activities.

So we simplified this into comparing the difficulty of a Model's job and an Athlete's job. I am of the view that Model's do not have as difficult of a job as an Athlete who's job is more physically taxing than that of a Model and Model's are very much blessed with ideal genetics and while Athletes are also blessed with genetics to make them more apt to play their particular sport it takes more training and skill to hone their craft than a Model. I do consider that a Model's career longevity may be alot shorter than an Athlete but I would rather not get into all that and leave these types of nuances up to you all to broaden my view since my co-worker and I are not experts on either of these careers by any means so I'm as open as I can be to any and all views.	7	26	0.58

This has been highlighted by an recent case where a women killed her husband with a 
Hammer and her murder conviction has been down graded to manslaughter. There is no sugfestion that her husbamd was ever physically abusive but put her down, cheated and `kept` her isolated. 

I have copied the below from a website incase anyone hadnt hesrd of the law.

""What is coercive control?

Coercive control is when a person with whom you are personally connected, repeatedly behaves in a way which makes you feel controlled, dependent, isolated or scared.

The following types of behaviour are common examples of coercive control:

isolating you from your friends and family

controlling how much money you have and how you spend it

monitoring your activities and your movements

repeatedly putting you down, calling you names or telling you that you are worthless""

...... 


""Your abuser will be guilty of the offence of coercive control if

he is personally connected to you, and

his behaviour has had a serious effect on you, and

your abuser knew or ought to have known that his behaviour would have a serious effect on you.

 

What does serious effect mean?

Your abuser’s behaviour is considered to have a serious effect on you if:

on at least two occasions you have feared that violence will be used against you, or

you have felt serious alarm or distress and it has had a substantial effect on your usual day to day activities. The behaviour has had a substantial effect on you if it has caused you to change the way you live. For example, you may have changed the way you socialise, your physical or mental health may have deteriorated, you may have changed the way you do household chores or how you care for your children. If you have changed the way you live in order to keep you or your children safe from harm, it is possible that the behaviour you are experiencing is coercive control.""

There are some crietia i agree shoumd be offences as the above list is not exhastive such as threat if physical violence but that was and is covered by a separate offence. 

To me it feels like a step to far people shoukd just leave and being a terrible husband/ wife shouldnt be an offence . Please change my veiw that this law is unfair and PC."	3	9

They shouldn't get to choose if they're in the area.	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xz3664/cmv_the_way_ridesharing_apps_allow_drivers_to/	"Hi all, 

I'm not sure if the money just isn't worth it for drivers anymore, which very well may be true, so I really am not coming at this from the perspective that the drivers are at fault.

Recently, I have been having a really hard time getting Ubers and Lyfts (just going to say ""rides"" or ""ride"") within a reasonable time frame from when I request a ride. I live on the outer edge of a large US city, in a neighborhood with a lot of traffic on a main throughway. Basically, there's no reason it should be so hard to get a ride because I know there are drivers around. 

Basically, where I used to be able to get a ride within 10 minutes, it now takes upward of 20 minutes between requesting a ride and the driver showing up. Just the other day, I had two drivers cancel on me in the 10 or so minutes after taking my ride, making me late to where I was going. Last week, I used Lyft's priority function and paid an extra $20 for fast pickup, but I still couldn't get a car for almost half an hour (I was refunded the difference with no trouble thankfully). I also ordered UberEats once last week from a restaurant like 10 minutes away, but nobody picked up my order and I had to go get it myself.

My view is that this is a problem stemming from how drivers can choose not to take rides while they are ""on the clock"" for lack of a better phrase. 

The way I understand it, when the passenger requests a ride or orders food, drivers in the area get an alert and they can choose whether or not to take it. This seems wrong to me. If a driver has logged into the app and is taking rides, they shouldn't have much of a say whether or not to take a ride in their area. The app should assign the driver rides based on location, and the drivers should be docked ""points"" if they reject too many rides for no good reason. 

Like, of course, I understand if a driver isn't able to take someone an hour away. I also understand that gas is expensive, and drivers are not compensated as well as they should be. But just because that's currently the business model doesn't mean it's right. 

My proposed solution would be something like this:

1. Drivers log into the app and say they're taking rides, marking themselves as ""available"" for a set period of time as if they are on the clock in a normal hourly job.

2. The apps assign rides to each driver based on location and demand. The driver cannot choose to reject the ride if they've marked themself available unless the ride would inevitably require them to drive in excess of their stated availability. Drivers not currently driving are assigned rides first unless there is nobody in the area not currently driving a passenger.

3. Once the driver has been assigned a ride, they cannot cancel barring an emergency. The rideshare companies institute an internal appeals process for drivers who are docked ""points"" because they cancelled in an emergency. 

4. If a driver is docked too many ""points"", they are either locked out of the respective app or forfeit a percentage of their earnings until they complete a certain number of trips or food orders without cancelling.

I'm happy to debate about the specific parts of my proposal, but I'm more focused on the general issue here. I know the proposal isn't perfect at all and may be unnecessarily harsh. 

Rideshare drivers should be making more money. It's wild that the companies are able to operate at a loss and pay limited to no taxes while their execs are making huge bucks. But that doesn't excuse the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of the business model.

And I also understand that this system is not perfect for suburban areas. But ultimately, limited driver availability should be known to passengers. If I'm in a big city and I need to be driven somewhere 30 minutes away, I should be able to call my ride 45 minutes ahead of time and get to my destination on time or almost on time.

In particular, people imply these works are not ultimately useful and the classes are built largely on bullshit guessing. I disagree.

For this post, I am using literature to mean written work that is considered an exceptionally significant use of language. This can include non-fiction like essays or memoirs, but I think most objections are to fiction or creative work like novels and poems. 

My key views are that:

(1) Studying literature is an effective approach to the most worthwhile goals of public education. 

(2) Literature studies are often undervalued because of misunderstandings about what the task represents. 

(3) While literary studies deal with ambiguity, the vast majority of work taught in public schools and undergraduate coursework is carefully curated to *not* be an exercise in intellectual futility. 


*Studying literature is an effective approach to the most important goals of public education.* 

Public education should provide students a complex and comprehensive understanding of how the world works, teach them how to reason and think critically, and produce thoughtful and functional participants in society.

The goal of public education should *not* be to streamline fourteen-year-olds into job titles they might want at forty. This focus assumes that students and teachers can guess correctly what students will “use,” and that ideas and experiences are only “useful” if we can later withdraw them from an ATM. An accountant with a deep understanding of social history, civic responsibility, and political thought is a better investment for her community than an accountant who only understands mathematics. The skills necessary to understand literature (contextual understanding, abstraction, close reading of difficult text, the ability to process unfamiliar material, engagement with ideas and experiences, rich and varied understanding of language) are skills we should consider absolutely vital in every graduate. 

Literary texts are a space we historically use to house rigorous conceptual work.You can’t learn critical thinking from a Top Ten Critical Thinking Strategies list, and you can’t think critically about simplistic material. Students who read literature see modeled examples of complex thought and are given a starting point for reacting with their own ideas. Science and math classes require *different* complex reasoning practice, but at the K-12 and undergraduate level these subjects are often necessarily more concrete content acquisition and recall than literary studies - even when labs and application are involved.  

Varied thinkers need exposure to many ideas over a long period of time, not just to one set framework for understanding the world. This includes understanding cultural history and how we arrived at ideas or attitudes that shape our society. Unlike a social studies class, literature *requires* readers to engage thinkers on their own terms, in their own words. Storytelling is a universal human trait, and stories represent the conscious and deliberate construction of meaning. Creative texts tells us a tremendous amount about how people think, rather than how they survive.

Literary reading also develops empathy. Empathy is a skill we know we can strengthen, and it is not just feel-goodery about being nice. Empathy requires radical recognition of how people experience the world differently than we do. If we want to fix political polarization, religious conflict, or disagreements about how to run the budget meeting, we can’t act like engaging other people’s expressed worldview is inherently less valid than understanding triangles. 

All students should have a diverse curriculum that offers a solid understanding of how human civilization operates. Future scientists and technological innovators should be *expected* to receive wide exposure to material outside their own sphere. Minds that complexly consider other perspectives are better at developing novel solutions and recognizing ingrained assumptions in their own thinking. 

Language is also incredibly rich and difficult. We can dislike the fact that language is fraught with association and nuance (I don’t think we should) but we can’t ignore it. If you want kids to grow up as highly effective adults, we should give them a profound understanding of how language can be manipulated and empower them as both communicators and receivers of information. Literature is by definition the right space to practice. 

We also cannot say students should learn to use language well but then imply that all non-literal use of language is fluffy interpretive gesturing. *All* language is figurative and expressive, period. Even the act of reducing bias and stating facts requires a sophisticated grasp on how language encodes assumptions. 

The fact that mastery of language is complicated to acquire and hard to pin down does not mean we should shrug off the process as meaningless. If we care about thinking clearly and communicating well, we should do the opposite.


*The study of literature is undervalued largely because of misunderstanding about what the task represents.*

The purpose and process of studying literature are often misunderstood, but that is not a justification for reducing its role in the classroom. 

The fact that teaching literature can be powerful does not always mean that it is in practice. Some schools fail to make a case for why the practice is valuable, so students shrug it off. Some teachers are bad teachers. This does not mean we should discard the discipline for something easier to teach. A Powerpoint slide on the discovery of DNA may provide a piece of scientific insight, but may not guide any other skills – even if the original process was elegant. That does not make a case against teaching the scientific method any more than a bad plot summary of Hamlet makes a case against teaching Shakespeare.  

Unfortunately, the impression that the content is not valuable can become an excuse for disengaging.

It is impossible to gain the skillset taught by literature from a summary of the literary work. First, the struggle of dealing with unfamiliar language is inherent to the point. Second, ideas are often simplified and reduced in summary, giving the false impression of simplistic thinking. This means when students half-ass an English class, they may get less out of it than when they half-ass a math class. 

It is also impossible to present or assess the skillset taught by literature in simplistic fashion. Plot knowledge is not the point, but it is the easiest check of whether a student cracked the book. This means that the demands on public school English teachers to write strong tests and grade responses *very* carefully are sometimes higher than on colleagues. That is no excuse. We *do* need to care about teaching English well. We do *not* fix those problems by deciding a bad handout on Homer is shows that literature is worthless but a bad handout on Darwin is a small failure in an admirable undertaking. 

Lastly, the teaching of literature is many public schools is certainly not terrible, but our cultural ambivalence towards reading makes it easy for people to convince themselves those classes were a waste. 

As a society, we associate books with intellectual achievement, but we can all be reluctant to tackle material that feels foreign, difficult, or unfamiliar. Instead, we to elevate the act of reading *anything* to a moral and academic achievement. If reading *period* is the only goal, then any time reading is not *fun* can be villainized. “I wasn’t entertained by The Scarlet Letter at fifteen, ergo actually studying English literature destroyed the noble undertaking of reading accessible contemporary novels uncritically” is a troubled notion. It is fair for to expect schools to strive for high engagement; it is absurd to blame a pattern of intellectual refusal on Mrs. Higgins in 10th-grade English. 


*The vast majority of works taught in public schools are deliberately NOT an exercise in intellectual futility or guesswork.*

Like reality, literature requires students to deal with uncertainty and possibility. Unlike reality, high school and undergraduate reading lists are mostly curated to yield satisfying and attainable conclusions. 

We are lulled by familiarity to feel like English should be more obvious than it is. Language is figurative, allusive, and expressive. Acknowledging that is the *only* way to learn about how we actually communicate, not a show-offy bonus. Even so, the feeling that literature is guesswork might come from poor understanding of what is actually being “interpreted” or decoded.

A work supporting more than one possible understanding is not the same as every answering being right. We can argue about whether the play suggests Hamlet is noble or weak, but we cannot argue about whether “To be, or not to be” is actually about ethical means of funding the fine arts in a taxed society. The fact that everyone responds to art differently also does not mean personal response is the same as academic interpretation. You can read Frost’s “Fire and Ice” and think of your puppy, but your puppy does not belong in an academic discussion of what the poem actually says. Because we often use literature as an intellectual framework to discuss related ideas and experiences, these distinctions can feel understandably hazy. 

Unfortunately, compounded with the fact that students in the learning process sometimes flatly misread or misconstrue difficult texts, it may feel like a teacher unapologetically rejects answers that don’t happen to match his own – even when those answers are objective misunderstandings. High school students *should* be reading material that feels difficult; the difficulty is necessary to developing the decoding skillset. However, this means students sometimes mistake inscrutable language for inscrutable meaning. Reading an allusive poem in Renaissance vernacular is hard on a denotative level, so even explicating what the poem literally says may feel like guesswork. The Scarlet Letter contains challenging prose *and * symbolic content. Students may complain that teachers impose symbolism even when Hawthorne states outright that the rose bush on the first page is a symbol then tells what it means. 

Kids are kids, and all this okay. The problem is when students also reply on plot summaries instead of working through material. Nearly every benefit of studying literature is erased by not reading literature: the process of critical reading is not practiced, empathetic engagement with alternate points of view does not take place, and complex ideas are deceptively simplified to the most basic forms. The non-study of literature *is* useless, just like memorizing the twenty answers on a math test is useless.

Summaries of literary works also encourage the feeling that meaning is invented at random. If every time a character is happy she thinks about a green raincoat from her childhood, it is not really “interpreting” to suggest the raincoat is associated with happiness.  But if you read a summary that says “the green raincoat is a symbolic representation of remembered joy,” it is natural to think “who says?” Bright students may scan the SparkNotes, decide literature is bullshit - - then use that impression to justify the decision to only read the SparkNotes. 

Worse, because they are dealing with widely-known works, students can skim enough online and listen enough in class to “fake it” on the test – and by saying potentially valid things they don’t actually recognize in the work, they gain the false impression that faking any answer has the same value as reaching a sound conclusion authentically. 

Finally, students don’t see the process of selecting texts. Many authors are careless and ineffective users of language, but students are given influential and well-crafted works. Reading lousy books is a waste of already limited time, but it can feel like every work is assumed to “mean” something beyond what it says. Many works taught in high school mean what they say outright, but even that requires looking *closely* at what they actually do *say.*

When our collective conversation about creative work is skeptical anyway and many participants have not actually read the works they condemn, dismissing literature feels like cheerful Emperor’s New Clothesism. There is pride in believing that at fourteen you and your entire freshman class outwitted the history of academic thought and discovered the bold truth that poems mean nothing. There is humility in considering that coherent and valuable material might seem difficult, inaccessible, or unclear even to smart kids - or smart adults.


TL;DR:

1. Literature is an ideal tool for the most important and most difficult capacities we should aim to develop in public schools. While a well-rounded and diverse education will expose students to related skills across classes, literature is unique in continually demanding a sophisticated grasp of language and a thoughtful, deliberate concern with other minds. 

2. Getting the best out of literary studies is hard, but worthwhile. We fix ineffective teaching practice by insisting on the value of the content, not by ditching it for something easier.

3. Many forces discourage students from putting in the time to read and grapple with literary texts, and partial engagement makes it easy to get the false impression that they have considered, mastered, and rejected material – and that opting out is more intellectually audacious than actually dealing with the works. 

CMV:

To be clear on my bias, I do work in education and am an enthusiastic reader of literature. I feel strongly about this topic, but I am posting because I am sincerely interested in whether people have objections I have not considered.

I would rather not troubleshoot every silly reading of a poem you are pretty sure your teacher offered in junior year, just like I’d rather not troubleshoot every botched lab practical in a defense of science education. However, if your example relates to a specific concern about the process, I am happy to think about approaches to analysis.

I’m talking from western perspective and my issue is about western culture. World is a large place and many cultures could use sexual liberation and, in these countries, sex should be discussed more openly. But for sake of this discussion we are only limiting our discussion to western culture. Secondly when I say overrated I don’t mean that it is irrelevant or a bad thing. People in online forums often forget that issues have multiple sides and assume the most extreme views. So, let me make this clear. I think sex is important part of any healthy relationship and it has lot of both mental and physical benefits. I’m saying sex is overrated meaning it often overshadows other equally or more meaningful aspects of life.

Why do I think sex is overrated? Not just in media but in every facet of life we often rise it up on a pedestal. We rate people based on their looks or sexual appeal. We break up otherwise healthy relationships if sex isn’t phenomenal. We use it as marketing tools. We base whole schools of human behavior on it. We ridicule men for their lack of sexual performance and shame women for enjoyment of it. And what is most important regarding this discussion is how sex overshadows other aspects we should be focusing on. For example, healthy relationships need good communication skills, shared values and interests. But we are not as obsessed of these as we are about sex. When you take any of my previous examples and try to apply any other aspect or metric than sex in them you don’t find as many examples in real life. We talk lot about how we value intelligence and creativity, but I have never felt same kind of zealous passion about them when compared to sex. Have I never heard phrase “Yes the sex is awful but I picked them because they are smart” but too often have heard the opposite.

I think this status that sex has gained in western culture creates unrealistic expectation. Teens get depressed because of their looks. Girls about their breasts and men about their penis size. We base our whole identities on how we look or who we fuck. Dumb people are ok but asexual are still considered freaks in society. This obsession also births much worse demons than depression. Pedophilia is just one extreme end that is IMHO outcome of sex being overrated in our culture. Recent sex scandals are just outcome of powerful people trying to appear sexually powerful. That is something that their peer group expects from them. This is terrible and wrong, but I see it is all symptoms of being raised in society where sex in the most important goal. I understand that similar cases are numerous through history and across different cultures but this all demonstrates that this is not a recent issue.

Then there is the economic sides of this discussion. Phrase “Sex sells” in universally accepted truth. Marketers put sex into everything and in every media. It’s impossible to avoid over sexualized marketing these days. Every other aspect of our lives is sold to us using sex making sex the baseline where we compere every other thing in our lives. Not every marketing campaign is guilty of this kind of acts but for any product you can find multiple examples.

To sum up. Sex is great. It should be talked about in openly and people should be shamed by it. But the way we glorify it in our society leaves other equally important facets of life overshadowed. To put some numbers to this (because I love numbers) 30% of the internet traffic is porn. And I say that we shouldn’t spend 30% of our time, wealth and collective knowledge of human kind on sex.

To change my view show that my experiences are not common (sex is not as prevalent as I think it is) or show how there is meaningful reason to make sex one (if not the one) of the most important thing in life."	56	57

When someone is in a ‘mood’ saying to that person “you’re being bitchy” shouldn’t be taken the same way as “you are a bitch.” Similar to “you’re being a dick” vs “you are a dick.”

If someone IS a dick/bitch that insists they cannot change and they simple exist as solely a  dick/bitch. However, when you say someone is being a particular way that insists something is perhaps bothering them or they don’t recognize their behavior and that can often be discussed and solved. 

I agree neither are the best or most respectful ways to address anyone but I’m simply saying the two phrases usually have totally different meanings and the latter in most cases shouldn’t be taken as offensively as the first. "	58	26

However I am also a cis girl, and the most I have of a second opinion are non binary friends that I have.

But basically the title. Non binary people aren't really either men or women, and they shouldn't be forced into those binary categories. Which is why I find it strange when non binary people call themselves lesbians.

Side note: gender non conforming is not the same as non binary. Gender non conforming often means a person identifies as their gender assigned from birth, but has traits of a different gender (example: a male who likes to wear skirts) Non binary means a person identifies as something other than their birth gender but not the other binary gender either. Also, I think that demigirls are fine to use the label of lesbian. 

Lesbian by definition is a woman who loves women. Non binary people aren't women. Wouldn't trying to squeeze them into a label meant for women be transphobic? Because why would non binary people want to be seen as women if they're not? I have a non binary friend who says that seeing other non binary people identify as lesbians just confuses them, and that they would feel so much dysphoria if they were to be considered a woman.

People who argue for non binary lesbians often say ""if you're AFAB (assigned female at birth) and attracted to only women, you're a lesbian"" But I can't help but find that argument extremely transphobic. This argument would basically be saying that trans men who like girls are lesbians, and trans women who like girls aren't, just because of what they we're assigned at birth. Which I find disgusting, because trans people are completely valid and to minimize someone to their assigned gender at birth is puke worthy. Trans lesbians are lesbians, period. 

Then there are those who say ""lesbians are non men who love non men, and non binary people fit everywhere"" and I personally hate this argument the most because this is not what a lesbian is. I understand the need for inclusivity, but I don't feel comfortable with a label meant for me as a girl who likes other girls to be changed into something that revolves around the fact that it's not being about other men. The point of lesbians is for it to NOT be about men, so why even edit this into the definition? I'm only attracted to women, not non binary people, and to expand the label to be more ambiguous just makes it more complicated. I find trying to argue that lesbian isn't just for women is erasure. 

Lastly, people who say there's a lack of better labels. That's not true. Trixic (non binary loves women) and toric (non binary loves men) are kinda new I agree, but they're both labels made specifically for the non binary community. Why would non binary people want to use a label for women (when they're not) when there's already labels for them as non binary people? Creating space for non binary people is important, but to just mash them with lesbians just because they also like girls is both confusing and even intrusive. 

I am well aware this opinion is controversial and that's why I want to change it. I'm expecting the comments to be a mess and calling me a gatekeeper, but I want to see how everyone feels about this. I know there are lesbians who agree that it's a women only label, and others that say that it shouldn't be rigid. I fully support non binary people, and am not even stone set on this opinion. I am mainly just confused as to why those who are not women insist on calling themselves a woman only label, when there's already other better fitting labels just for non binary people that don't make things more complicated for us."	40	95	0.72

If there are any inaccuracies in my post, please let me know. I'm not religious but I crafted this argument in an attempt to challenge, question, and learn more about religion.

**TL;DR:** I believe that there's no religious rationale behind giving health conditions to a newborn child since (a) that child has never sinned, and (b) making the child healthy instead would be inconsequential in terms of God's plan.

The most common rebuttal (which I've read on various religious websites) to theses similar to mine explains that God's ways are much higher than ours (i.e it's all part of God's plan). I believe that the main error here is that over the countless years of which God's plan has been set in motion, there have been so many events and details of higher significance than my health. Therefore, if I was born without the two health conditions I currently have, the end result of God's plan would not be changed at all. It is established that God is omnibenevolent since he sacrificed his only son (Jesus) to compensate for the sins of humans, and therefore, there would not be any incentive for God to want his children, created in His image, to be born with health issues. 

According to the theologian Leslie Weatherhead, the will of God can be generalized in three categories: intentional, circumstantial, and ultimate. When I mentioned the many events of higher significance and then questioned the reason for my health conditions, that was an example of me questioning the *ultimate* will of God. If the ultimate will of God is for His kingdom to be advanced, then He wishes for more people to willingly submit to his reign. If God exists, then He would not want people to believe that he does not exist, in light of His ultimate will. Therefore, in order to eliminate any shadows of doubt that may be cast due to misfortunes prescribed in His plan, He should never allow his children to be born with conditions."	0	41	0.26

[CMV]"	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1z4aqv/all_officials_of_the_legal_system_including/	"**The System is broken.**

This truth is beyond debate. Every day we see more and more evidence of corruption, misconduct, incompetence and abuse of power in our legal system. We get angry, we complain, we rally and protest, we hang our heads in saddness and shame, and nothing changes. We elect politicians who promise to make things better, and nothing changes. 

How can We the People take back the power to make our country a better place to live?


I think the best approach would be to have *ALL* members of the justice system directly elected by the people. Police and prosecutors and judges; all of them. No more political appointments or purely bureaucratic hiring practices that cut out the ability for the end consumer to decide for themselves who will provide such necessary and important services. Imagine if cops charged with brutality (and caught on tape!) had to run for re-election. That shit wouldn't fly for a second. If prosecutors had to defend their decision to take an elderly woman to court in forfeiture proceedings intended to seize her home just because her grandson was dealing a little weed, would we choose to keep that person in a position of power? If judges had to justify their ruling to hold massive polluters not responsible to the community poisoned by the chemicals, would we allow them to keep their seat on the bench?

Some might say this is completely impractical and therefore impossible to make such a system work. This may be true; it may just be too cumbersome to be actually workable. Perhaps the best available practical method is for the system itself to determine hiring requirements and make selections based on those criteria, just as it does now.  If so, then we still need a ""recall"" or ""Vote of No Confidence"" process by which We the People may directly remove any official from public service if they fail to meet the public's standard for acceptable competence or appropriate behavior in the administering of their duties. If the people do not support a given person serving in a given capacity, then that person should be removed from that position of power over the people. This should remain a separate proces from criminal charges or civil damages for misconduct and abuse of power.

What say you, reddit: Is this the best possible solution? Do you have a better idea?


*****

Edit: **Why do this? What would it accomplish?**

So if we have a cop on video who is bullying a man in the most disgusting manner, then proceeds to kill that man during a bad arrest with no probable cause, and he is later ""cleared"" of wrongdoing by ""internal review"", should not the public have the final say about whether they wish to risk being treated in a similar fashion by this person? 

I see these videos of obvious and attrocious misconduct and I have the strong urge to carry a weapon so that I may shoot first (even though it mean my own death or incarceration) should I ever encounter that officer. I would prefer a non-violent option to remove bad cops when they can be properly identified and when the legal system itself fails to hold it's own members accountable for their actions. 

/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut

See the above link and take note of all cases of obvious and egregious violations of civil rights and the public trust (including many outright murders) that result in no punishment and no charges, often despite clearly damning video evidence. This travesty of justice must not be allowed to continue. Something has got to give. My idea may not be the best, but this discussion is an important part of the process. 

Some have asserted that we already have elected officials to serve in this administrative capacity. The problem is that we are led to believe that state and federal elected law-makers will positively influence the bureaucracy, when the reality is that it is the bureaucracy which ends up corrupting them. The bureaucracy is too big for such a small group to micromanage.  The better solution is to allow for more direct influence of the componant parts of that bureaucracy by having the people themselves take a more active hand in selecting or rejecting their mid-level and front-line public officials directly."	1	31

I use this question to judge people as part of my hiring process. It is far and away my favorite question to ask. I don’t judge people who want to fly, teleport, protect, or shapeshift, and it’s usually one of those or invisibility. When someone chooses invisibility I think they are creepy! Why would you want to sneak around and spy on people? Why are you afraid people in your life act differently when they think you’re not watching? 

A couple have answered like this “Mindreading? Wait, no, that would be awful, actually I don’t want to know.” Then they pick something else. People who pick invisibility are confident about their choice and don’t think twice about it. 

Enough people have answered with invisibility that I am now questioning my bias. What am I missing? 

Recently I asked the person to explain why. They said it was because they wanted to know what people would say behind their back. I then asked what they would do if they found out someone they thought was a friend spoke poorly about them. They answered, “I wouldn’t change my behavior, I would just know I can’t trust them, but they would never know why.” 

This person exhibited other evidence of avoidant communication style. I didn’t hire them. I’m afraid this was a case of confirmation bias! 

Are people who choose invisibility creepy?"	21	71	0.67

That tax payers  money is being grossly wasted by illegal immigrants or that they are taking jobs that our unemployed citizens could fulfill. 



Somehow we are allowing a predisent and his party to tell us that immigration is one of the biggest issues our country is currently facing. What about our roads? What about our education system? We can't find tax dollars to solve these issues but we have billions to throw at a wall? 



Heres how I see it: Wealthy people aren't paying the same portion of their income in taxes as the average Joe. I'm not saying they should pay more taxes than the average person, shit I'm not even saying they should pay the same percentage, I just think they should pay taxes. Our current tax system allows this stuff to happen. Not all rich people are bad but they have the opportunity to avoid paying taxes so why wouldn't they? Wouldn't you like to have more money in your pocket? Finding a way to avoid paying taxes sounds great but we need to understand that it's the economy of this great country that has allowed us to make our money and we owe little back to it to make sure that it continues in good health. But somehow they have convinced people that, ""no the issues isn't that we aren't collecting taxes fairly and allowing billions of tax dollars to be lost in loopholes, the reason we don't have tax dollars to give your kids a quality education is because those immigrants are taking advantage of us all! Let's build a expensive wall so they can't come here. ""



Let's look through our history books and think about walls.... When was there a wall separating people? I don't know, maybe Berlin? Reagan was huge advocate of getting that wall to come down and now the same people that praise Reagan to this day are the same people who want to build the wall? 



Regardless of where you stand politically the fact is that even our president hasn't been paying taxes and now he is the one that's going to spend a huge amount of our taxes on something that will only hurt the people that are paying for it. 



I understand that we can't allow thousand/millions (whatever the number) of people to swarm into our country. We have always limited the amount of people coming into the US there definitely is some amount of illegal immigration that would cause harm to the economy. But we are really seeing that level of immigration right now? We are seeing so much immigration right now that it one of the leading cause for the horrible state our country is currently sitting in?



Immigrants are part of our economy whether you like it or not. They do jobs for low pay that Americans won't do. You want to see a complete shut down of agriculture? Let's see who is putting food in the grocery store once we deport all the immigrants. 



Maybe this should be posted in r/rage... Good luck changing my mind because it's pretty clear to me what is happening."	11	22

1)  Admittance to restrooms is based on your biological sex at birth.

I really don't know how you would enforce this. I don't think anyone is going to want to show ID to enter the whizz palace.

2) Admittance to the restroom is based on your appearance.

Okay, but I mean, trans people exist. I'm not sure who decides which trans people are and are not passing as their gender.

The argument against seems to be focused on public safety. Like, if we allow trans women to use public restrooms, then any random man could say he was a trans woman and you'd have to let him in, and women wouldn't feel safe. 

That makes sense, except like I said, trans people exist, and a non-zero amount of them are not ""clockable"" as trans, which means that trans men who are indistinguishable from cis men would have to use the women's restroom, and I feel like plenty of people would have a problem with that, if for no other reason than the fact that it brings back the same problem.

The hypothetical lying rapist who was claiming to be a trans woman can now just claim to be a trans man, and now he's back in the women's restroom. Banning trans people from their bathroom of choice doesn't solve the problem at all.

Like, there are statistics on the likelihood of a trans person being the victim vs. the perpetrator of the assaults people are trying to prevent, but we don't even need to get into that to make the point.

I'm genuinely curious is there's some aspect of this I'm missing."	554	928	0.8
changemyview	t3_dtw2lj	https://www.reddit.com//r/changemyview/comments/dtw2lj/cmv_when_considering_if_life_is_meaningful_or/	2019-11-09 13:43:52	Dan_Today	CMV: When considering if life is meaningful or meaningless, it is useful to consider that comparisons to the size and temporal duration of the entire universe are relative and arbitrary and no more or less relevant than comparisons to human-scale sizes and time durations	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/dtw2lj/cmv_when_considering_if_life_is_meaningful_or/	"It is my view that life is meaningful. I’m talking about the meaning of words, objects, and events. For example, these words you are reading have meaning, objects like homes or special gifts have meaning, events like graduating from an academic program or getting a job have meaning. (Note: much of my view also applies to ***purpose***; I will address that more at the end, but I’m focusing on ***meaning*** to keep things relatively simple.)

I frequently see people putting forth a view that *life is meaningless*, which seems to be based on one or both of these arguments:

•Compared to the great size and temporal duration of the universe, our lives are extremely small

•All meaning is “purely subjective”

1.) Regarding the first point, it’s important for me to note that I think it’s anybody prerogative to compare their life to the great size and duration of the universe. But in my view there seems to be a degree of arbitrariness to that choice. For example, when considering the size of the Earth, we might say the Earth is very tiny compared to the size of the entire universe, but we might say that the Earth is massive when compared to the size of my apartment. In my view, the claim that the Earth is tiny is not exactly wrong per se, but there does seem to be a degree of arbitrariness when choosing to think about it that way. Another person could claim that the Earth is enormous, and they would be equally right.

Applying the above metaphor to meaning, we would start by acknowledging that there is meaning in the world (these words have meaning, for example). You could say these meanings are tiny to the point of being meaningless (when compared to the entire universe) or you could say that the meanings are substantial (when compared to the babblings of a baby or the moos of a cow). In my view, both interpretations are equally right.

***Here is a thought experiment that further illustrates my view on meaning as it relates to relative size and temporal duration:***

*Let’s say that over the next hundred billion years, humanity manages to colonize vast reaches of the universe. We establish dense populations not just on all livable planets, but we also create trillions of enormous space stations. Over these hundred billion years, we increase the percentage of the meaningful activity from the itsy bitsy fraction it is today to a more significant proportion---say we manage to fill 50% of the physical universe with meaningful activity. Would a human life (that a person may consider to be meaningless today) be considered to be meaningful in this hypothetical future because we collectively increased our “meaning footprint” relative to the grand size and temporal duration of the universe?*

My answer would be that a human life today is as meaningful as a human life would be in the future of the thought experiment.

*We could modify the thought experiment to posit the discovery of a highly powerful, intelligent, meaningful entity that has existed since nearly the beginning of the universe and will continue to exist until nearly the and that “fills up” a large percentage of the available space of the universe with meaning or meaningful activity. My view in this thought experiment would be that a human life BEFORE discovering such an entity would be as meaningful as a human life would be AFTER discover such an entity.*

***Another angle:***

When a person gets dumped or loses somebody in their life, it is common to experience the world from the perspective of the absence of that person. If a person’s close relative dies and somebody asks them how their holiday break was, they may answer “it was lousy because my father/mother/grandmother wasn’t there this year.” After some time passes, the absence may become less acute, and a person may start seeing things from the perspective of what they still actually DO have. I don’t think either perspective is more *correct* than the other, and, as I have mentioned, I believe it is anybody’s prerogative to see things however they want. But in the context of my life, it seems more fruitful to look at the question of meaning from the perspective of what meaning I DO have rather than from the perspective of how much meaning seems to be absent in comparison to the vast size and duration of the entire universe.

**2.) Regarding the view that meaning is purely subjective:**

*(Edit: My view is that meaning is NOT purely subjective.)*

In my view, subjectivity is a necessary ingredient for meaning, but subjectivity alone is not sufficient for meaning. Kind of like how butter is a necessary ingredient to make cookies, but it is not alone sufficient.

For example, the Rocky Mountains have meaning for a lot of people. ***The geological formation of the mountains is a necessary ingredient for their meaning.*** The meaning of the Rocky Mountains is not purely subjective just as a cookie is not purely butter. In my view, subjectivity is a necessary ingredient for meaning, but the formation of the mountains is also a necessary ingredient. In some sense, the entire history of the universe--at least as much of the universe as is implicated in the formation of the Rocky Mountains--figures into the meaning of the Rocky Mountains.

(Of course, as I discussed above, meaning is not a function of “relative size.” But I think it’s worth noting the relative size of the ingredients in this particular example to draw attention to the necessity of the objective physical universe when conceptualizing meaning. In my view, the claim that *meaning is purely subjective* is a weak claim because it does not take into account the necessity of the objective physical universe.)

***Another angle on this theme:***

In some limited or abstracted sense, it is not exactly wrong to say that meaning is purely subjective, but when it comes to *actual examples* of meaning, there is ALWAYS more than just an individual’s subjectivity that figures into a given instance of meaning.

As a metaphor, you could say that rain is water vapor that is held in the air that eventually condenses and falls to the earth in droplets. In a limited and abstracted sense, this is not wrong. But when you look at actual cases of rain, there is ALWAYS more to the story. The moisture in the air evaporated from a body of liquid water or transpired from some plants or boiled and steamed its way into the air. Perhaps prevailing winds moved the moist air around. Perhaps changes in air temperature affected how much moisture the air could hold. Perhaps mountains or other geological features forced the air to change elevations and mix with air of different temperatures. Perhaps the heating effects of the sun or the cooling effects of the absence of the sun influenced the air temperature. ***There’s always more to actual instances of rain than just the basic explanation of rain. Likewise, actual instances of meaning are ALWAYS predicated on more than just subjectivity.***

As before, it is anybody’s prerogative to think of meaning however they want. My view is a view I am cultivating for my own personal purposes. As such, thank you in advance for comments and challenges that you may have. I also want to share this here because I think some percentage of people who talk about life being meaningless are struggling, and, in some subs, I don’t often see counter-perspectives given or secular ways to consider life as meaningful.

*By the way, I have focused mostly on a specific type of meaning in this post. I appreciate that many folks define* ***meaning*** *in a way that is closer to* ***purpose***. *Much of what I have written in the post applies equally to purpose. For example, in my view it is clear that we have purposes in our lives. (Getting out of bed, eating food, brushing one’s teeth, bathing, etc are all done for a purpose). The discussion of scale and scope applies to purpose as much as it does to meaning. In my view, purpose is also not purely subjective. I would approach that discussion from the angle of the evolution of human physiology in particular environments as the non-subjective drivers of purpose, which also applies to meaning in a way that I did not address above.*"	5	24

1) Yes, there are problems men face too, like unequal consideration for child custody and difficulty being taken seriously when abused. Whether  you blame the ""patriarchy"" or ""feminism"" for those problems, we should all be able to acknowledge they exist and should be solved.

2) I don't care who has it worse. I think women do, but it **doesn't matter**: each individual issue should be fought against and corrected by all sane, ethical people.  To say that women have a lot more problems so men's issues aren't important is like saying that discrimination against blacks is the worst racism in the US so discrimination against any other minority is unimportant.

But the problem I have with MRA and MRActivists I've encountered, both on the internet and offline, is that they seem to focus far less on **actually solving problems** than airing their grievances and complaining about feminism.

That's not how civil equality is obtained.  It requires coalition, awareness, and organized effort.  MRAs seem stuck on the second part, and that's being charitable.

And before some MRA says they **can't** accomplish anything because feminists keep shouting them down and ""pulling fire alarms"" (which only happened at the University of Toronto, as far as I'm aware):

Women chained themselves to fences while fighting for their rights.

Women went on hunger strikes while fighting for their rights.

Women were arrested, firehosed, and beaten while fighting for their rights.

All in a society that blatantly, in the letter of the law, treated them as second class citizens. Same goes for black rights activists. Same goes for gay rights activists. 

So I don't find the argument that MRAs can't accomplish anything because they're being held down by ""The Woman"" particularly effective.

All that said, I do want to give the people who are involved in MRA the benefit of the doubt and assume good intentions: I just can't find myself respecting them or the movement as anywhere near on the same level as an actual civil rights group.

To change my view, help fill out the following comparison:

**Major Accomplishments by Various Feminist Movements**

* Equal Rights to Education
* Equal Rights to Vote
* Equal Rights to Work
* Protections From Workplace Discrimination
* Rights to Use Birth Control (still being contested in many states and forms)

**~~Major Accomplishments~~* Any Progress Toward Goals by Various Men's Rights Activism**

* ???
* ???
* ???
* ???
* ???

Thanks.

Edit:

I'll make it easier, since people keep bringing up the age of the movement: just show me progress toward the goals. Show me something they're trying to do to bring about change or help men, besides just talk about the issues.

Edit 2:

Okay, think I'm done here.  The best argument so far has been [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2ygdlk/cmv_im_a_man_who_finds_mra_more_irritating_than/cp9tyaf?context=3), and ""Just wait, MRA is still in its infancy, it'll bring about positive changes eventually"" seems to be the consensus among the sane responders. Everyone else is just doing the usual blaming of women and feminism for all of men's troubles and for why men haven't been able to improve other men's lives. Since I don't have the patience to read through any more posts insulting me for not acknowledging the problems men face (despite me doing so twice in the very first paragraphs of this post) I'll leave it at this: I'll respect MRAs when they do something to actually make my life as a man, or the lives of other men, better. Until then, the ones I meet seem to be doing more harm than good.

Thanks for all of you that gave an actual effort, and those of you that gave some food for thought regarding the shift in public perception that might come with a new generaton of MRAs.

I got a couple good arguments, but nobody convinced me.  Essentially, what I understood was that the argument that men dressing as a woman marks women, and not men, as inferior because patriarchal oppression is omnipresent across human history.  So essentially, restrictions on dressing as a woman doesn't prove that women are seen as inferior, but women are seen as inferior a priori, so any gender norm, whether it grants freedom or restriction, points to male domination.  And so, essentially, the argument REALLY IS: 

Men are bad people and oppressors of women.  That is why women are seen as inferior.  That is why the restriction on men dressing women exists.

But if you don't believe the premise, which I don't, there is no argument really, except ""because"".  When you believe patriarchal oppression is omnipresent.  That it is the source of all good and all evil in the world, then ""because"" is a good enough answer.  It's like a kind of belief in God that believes ""because God"" is a good enough explanation of everything from deer antlers to marriage law.  Here ""because men are bad; they created patriarchy"" is also a good enough explanation of everything from why voting restrictions are bad for women, but freedom in dress styles are also bad for women.  

The fact that this way of thinking encourages permanent victimhood is a separate thing to talk about.  

But I would like to focus on this argument.  That when people put forth a claim that society ""tells us that women are inferior"" (something I've never actually heard in real life) what they actually believe is that society is this way because men are oppressive as a gender trait, so the claim itself is an indication of the opposite.  The person must truly believe men are bad to claim that society says women are inferior.

I would like to hear a deeper perspective on this if it can change my view.  "	9	246

The main implication of the view expressed here is that in primaries with no guarantee of any commitment by the voter to the party (mainly blanket and nonpartisan blanket primaries), candidates should not get to freely choose their parties, as this compromises the party's identity. 

A few states such as California, Washington, and Alaska used to use a blanket primary system. In these, a voter can vote for anyone regardless of party, and for each party, the candidate (or candidates in the case of a block election) with the most votes is the nominee. There is zero association between a voter and the party's primary they may be voting in, and they need not commit to voting for one party or the other. In California Democratic Party v. Jones, this system was struck down as unconstitutional in a 7-2 majority for violating the 1st amendment's implied right to freedom of association.

However, these states have since adopted a nonpartisan blanket primary system in which an election is held where voters may vote for any candidate, and a set number at the top advance to the general election. However, these candidates are still listed as the party of their choice, and this is what I object to. This system was upheld in a 7-2 majority in Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party.

I'm not opposed to nonpartisan blanket primaries, but candidates should not be able to identify as whatever party they please. A party is associated with its nominees, and if neither they nor committed voters decide those nominees, then a party's image may be ruined by an unwanted candidate chosen by outsiders who may have been inconsistent in their party selections.

To change my view, it would probably be best to assess the rights of parties to choose their image. I understand there may be significant negative effects as candidates with a major party ID of any type have a huge advantage and parties may use their own discretion to try to shut a candidate that they can't reasonably distance themselves from (such as an incumbent who was clearly part of the party but was not always in line) to push extremism, but I think the overall principal must hold more weight."	1	23	0.5

For example, the claim that meat harms health is dependent upon many factors, one of which is the carelessness of the consumer about how much meat is in his/her diet. In fact, meat is more convenient as a protein source because it can provide all the essential amino acids and nutrients in one serving, while plant foods provide inadequate levels of nutrients in one serving. According to the T. Colin Campbell Center for Nutrition Studies, in an article written by T. Colin Campbell himself, “Animal based proteins, of course, are much more similar to our proteins, thus are used more readily and rapidly than plant proteins. That is, ‘substrate’ amino acids derived from animal based proteins are more readily available for our own protein synthesizing reactions which allows them to operate at full tilt. Plant proteins are somewhat compromised by their limitation of one or more amino acids.”


Environmentally speaking, vegetarian diets are not necessarily better for the environment than non-vegetarian, because I can argue that a vegetarian diet causes an increase in the use of weed-killing herbicides which are toxic to plants and fish. Again, the arguments for environmental causes are too broad: human practices that threaten the environment can not be used as an excuse to argue that killing animals for food, or planting food is harmful to the environment, it is the method with which these are done that is to blame and that can always be solved. 


I think that the moral argument against eating meat is false and unfounded, not to mention the fallacy of elevating animal life over plant life. Every animal will eventually die or be killed; it is natural to kill for food. What is not ethical, however, is torturing animals before they die, or giving them a slow death. Again, that can be solved by finding ways to kill them without feeling pain. 


Clearly, an unbalanced diet composed of only meat is harmful, and a vegetarian diet is less efficient in delivering the nutrients needed by the body. So a balanced diet of meat and vegetables is superior to a vegetarian diet. CMV

There's also the video where they threw some ted liquid on a painting in a museum.

How does this help fight climate change?

When the average Joe who works to feed his family can't go to work because of someone blocking the road, it's not going to make him think ""oh wow, climate change is really affecting us huh?"", it's just going to make him vote for politicians how are against climate change activism. Disrupting normal people only hurts the climate change movement.

I believe it would be a far better protest to go and protest in front of a government office, block the entrance there, spray paint it, whatever they want to do. It's the government's choice to ignore climate change, not the average Joe's. Go throw tomato juice on the municipality center, go block the mayor's road.

I think it's cowardly to attack random people who are just minding their own business. If you truly believe in your cause then attack the people responsible for climate change."	1	363	1.0

CMV.	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1xuqbe/i_believe_people_should_be_able_to_chose_an_area/	As a high school student interested in political science, I don't think it's valuable for me to learn math or science beyond what could be useful in day to day life (how to calculate %'s and the like). Because of this I propose that somewhere in a student's high school career (preferably partway through the 1st or at the beginning of the 2nd year) students should be able to pick an area of focus. This area of focus would not completely limit students, they would still have the freedom to take classes outside of their focus, but the vast majority or their classes would be related to their area of focus. This would allow students to learn more information pertinent to their area of study, and prepare them better for life outside of school. It would also keep students interested in the physical sciences from wasting time learning how to analyze literature, and students interested in social sciences  from wasting their time learning trig identities. 	10	27

Let me justify this:

I can experience suffering, and my brain is the tool that allows me to do this. It follows that others who have a similar brain to me will have similar conscious experiences, and so can also suffer - when you see another human in pain, the reason you feel it should stop is that you can imagine the subjective experience of their suffering. We assume that similarity in brain structure creates similarity in subjective experiences.

From this it follows that other beings who have similar brain mechanisms of feeling pain will also subjectively experience pain in a similar way to us. Neurologically, pain is managed by the [brain stem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstem), which is one of the most primitive parts of the brain. Most of the animals that we eat, such as chickens, cows, and pigs have a brain stem of very similar structure to our own. They also react to pain in the same way (avoiding the source of the pain, trying to make it stop). So we can see that if we can assume that other humans have similar subjective experiences to our own due to similarities in neurology, we can extend this to other animals: While their subjective experiences will be markedly different to our own, the process of feeling pain is largely the same. ***So our brains are similar enough to those of most meat animals to assume that they feel pain in a similar way to us***. 

While it may be the case that some of the dumber meat animals such as chickens lack the mental capacity for fear, or other emotions typically associated with suffering, the experience of pain is essentially the same. An individual chicken may suffer less than an individual human in the same conditions, but the *scale* of the meat industry is so huge that, to a large extent, the suffering it causes outweighs any human concern. Roughly [9 *billion*](http://farmusa.org/statistics11.html) chickens are slaughtered each year in the USA *alone*. There is typically zero concern for the welfare of these chickens. [Debeaking without anaesthetic, hormone-driven unnaturally fast growth, and an excessively cruel slaughtering process](http://kb.rspca.org.au/What-are-the-welfare-issues-relating-to-meat-chicken-production_85.html) make the living conditions of these chickens indisputably hellish - and we already *know* that they essentially feel pain in the same way as us. 

It's the sheer scale that matters - even if you think that a chicken can only suffer 0.1% (which I would argue is far too small) of what a human can go through, then you have the equivalent of 9 *million* humans in the USA dying in conditions that are probably worse than slavery *every year*.

Compare this with the slave trade in the USA. In 1860 there were [4 million slaves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1860_United_States_Census) in the USA. This wasn't the number of slaves dying every year - it was the number alive at any given point. So if we assume they had a life span of say, 35 years, you had about ~114,000 dying in the conditions of slavery - which is, according to the conservative estimate I gave above is *90 times less bad than the American chicken industry*. And that's *only* if you assume that meat chickens have an equal quality of life to slaves, which I highly doubt - slaves were never fed growth hormones and were not systematically slaughtered in exceptionally cruel ways. So you can see that with a fairly blunt but hardly unreasonable analysis, meat eating causes almost two orders of magnitude more suffering than slavery.

The only upside of meat is that it is tasty - tasty enough for its existence to improve people's quality of life by say, 10% (I think this is an overestimate, as I am a vegetarian and not particularly less happy than I was before). Consider an equivalent action that could improve people's life quality by 10% - such as giving everyone in the USA $50,000. Would *you* accept $50,000 if it meant reinstating slavery? I doubt it. You certainly wouldn't accept $50,000 for something that's nearly 100 times worse than slavery. Even if that number is way off the mark - even if we quartered it, or got an eighth of it - the suffering caused by the meat industry is *so huge* that it's simply not worth the payoff. I think that shows pretty plainly that meat is a morally disgusting act *at least* on the level of slavery, and should almost certainly be abolished.

Please note: I'm a firm utilitarian. Appeals to nature or rights are unlikely to change my mind on anything. Please talk about how eating meat makes the world a better place for those who live in it."	3	153

Now, I like to think of myself as an open-minded guy. But despite most recent terrorist attacks being carried out by people claiming to be Islamic, I seriously disagree with the assertion that Islam must be inherently violent. Here are my arguments:

1. People have committed acts of violence since we started being people (and probably before). Religion has throughout the centuries been used as a convenient justification for violence, whether or not the religion itself advocated it. Easy examples of religion being used to justify violence are the Crusades, the Reconquista, the conquests of Timur, violence against native Americans by colonial powers, the slave trade, and the early Ottoman conquests.

In my humble opinion, religion can justify anything if interpreted a certain way. Christianity isn't violent, and neither is Islam. But you could certainly interpret it that way.

2. The Middle East is unstable not because Islam is inherently violent, but because Western powers (namely the United Kingdom and France) meddled in a region and later encouraged democracy in a region that had known only autocracy. ""Wow, the Middle East is so violent! Guess Islam is violent!"" No. During the Great War, the British encouraged the Arabs in the Ottoman Empire to rise up. If they did, Britain promised, they would have independence. But after the war, the Arabs were basically shafted as the U.K. and France took over large chunks of the Middle East. This generated quite a bit of resentment. The Allies also tried to bully the newly formed Turkey, which (under the esteemed Mustafa Kemal) defeated a small Allied force and forced the Allies to the negotiating table.

Later, the U.K. and France granted their possessions independence (as Iraq, Syria, Jordan, Egypt, and others) but then decided that the Jews should also have a chunk of land in Palestine. This also generated considerable resentment and sparked a war, which the West-backed Israel won. And then tl;dr the U.K. also had the democratically elected prime minister of Iran deposed by the despotic and repressive Shah over oil interests. And then the U.S. invaded Iraq twice (one time too many).

Basically, blaming Islam for the violence in the Middle East is outright crazy. There would be violence in any region with such atrociously handled interventionism (see the Shining Path in Peru, Africa).

3. But Sharia is evil! And sexist! And cruel! Well, no. It's not. Sharia is the core of a person's belief in Islam, and asking Islamic people to give it up would be akin to asking a Jewish person to burn the Torah. Sharia is a way of life, with only a small part of it devoted to law. Sharia is based in the Quran, which like any religious text is open to interpretation. So while the Quran is the world of God, its interpretation (fihq) is subject to human error. There are interpretations of the Quran that call for violence, and others that condemn it.

In his ideal world, people wouldn't be *free* to use proprietary software.

As a side note, I find the FLOSS movement flawed in its idea of there being a viable alternative for every piece of proprietary software, and the idea of anyone having the right of tamper with the software is pointless since not everybody has the ability or the interest in doing so, most people just want software that works. e.g. As a musician, there isn't a real FLOSS alternative to Ableton Live, most audio production software is sub-par and clumsy.

People should live and let live.	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/4eraue/cmv_people_take_genderrelated_issues_too/	"I'm seeing all of the conflict that arises when people bring up gender, and it really confuses me. Generally, when abortion or some other controversial topic comes up, people sort of say, ""All right, let's not get into this."" With gender, it seems to be no-holds-barred. Like, it's alright to contest others' opinions when the topic is gender/sexuality. There's not that same civility that there is with other topics. With other things people more often are able to say, ""I disagree, but acquiesce-- this conversation; not my belief."" With gender, people seem permitted to denounce others' beliefs freely.

The situation:
I was in a group of people high schoolers-- writing to our various state representatives about the HB2 law. We had all chosen to. One trans boy said something a girl responded, or the girl said something, and the boy responded by denouncing the girl's belief. I said, ""Hey, you can't give her a belief. Just let it go. You're not gonna be able to change it right now."" And he goes, hostilely, ""No! I tried to kill myself because--"" And I raise my hands, palms up, and say, ""Listen, I agree with you. I think you're right. But I don't want to get into this, if that's alright."" And, apparently, it wasn't alright.

UPDATE:I apologized a moment ago, and he says, ""No, it was my fault."" I say, ""No, it was mutual."" So maybe he was slightly mitigating, but still-- I'm still wondering about this.

I know this view is totally flawed. I'm still trying to form beliefs-- or at least understand convictions-- about gender and HB2 and etc.

CMV	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1h5n7f/i_dont_think_stopping_abortions_after_20_months/	In light of the recent filibuster (which was a great accomplishment) I do not see why 20 weeks is a bad limit (the reduction of centers is bullshit.) The fetus just seems too much like a person at that stage, and not just a mass of cells. I'm not for banning abortions all together, I just think a 20 week limit isn't such a bad thing. I guess my core view is once it is viable it should not be allowed to happen. Please I invite you to change my view, this whole situation has left me feeling very conflicted.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_viability what I partially base my view on. **EDIT: Yes there is a mistake in the title.

We don't generally trust our politicians/law enforcement officers higher in the chain/authoritative figures because we don't trust their abilities to restrain their power and influence, as we are all humans and irrational beings.

So in order to have a government/authority we could trust, I've been thinking that anyone that wields power over a large group of people should accept that everything they do/say will be freely available to those your have power over.

This way, a) people who run for positions of power will do so with values that reflect their lives, as hypocrisy would be quickly discovered, b) people in power would not be able to perform any acts of corruption, as they would be called out immediatly and c) we would once and for all have honest, hardworking people who actually do care about society and are willing to sacrifice their personal lives for change.

CMV."	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1uyqq4/i_believe_it_would_be_legally_remiss_and/	"Lately I've seen a push to start using only the term ""child abuse/exploitation imagery"" instead of calling it CP. The reason is because people feel that calling it porn sexually legitimizes it, whereas there is nothing legitimate about a minor being sexually abused. However, I think that it would be dishonest to change this term without completely changing our notion of what the illegal imagery actually is. In the end, such a move could actually harm more than it helps by providing a loophole to produce sexual material.

The fact is, you cannot equate CP with child abuse because in many cases, the images are made with the will of the subject and no one is forcing them to do it. I am referring to ""selfies"", which is a continually growing trend of people taking self-shot images of themselves. I haven't been in high school for a while, but during the advent of the camera phone, I remember quite a few girls taking these and sending them to certain people. I can only assume this still goes on today, even more so now that they have ""SnapChat"" which will supposedly delete the image after the receiver views it. This seems harmless in theory, but according to the law this is CP if the sender is a minor, and therefore just as punishable as any other CP. So if the law was changed to forbid child abuse/exploitation imagery instead of child pornography, they would have to allow stuff like this. It's only logical, no one's being abused here - unless you want to consider the person who takes these images to be self-harming, in which case the only logical response is to punish people for taking images of themselves and treat them as abusers of children, which I doubt ANYONE would find acceptable.

The problem is, this sets up a burden on the legal system to prove abuse. So now, adults can coerce minors into creating content which is technically self-made, and it cannot be immediately assessed as illegal material without an investigation. And all the ""secret abuser"" needs to do is tell the minor to say the pictures were made under no duress. The result is that it becomes much harder to actually punish people, as the material that would be illegal under the current law would now be legal. Ultimately, this sets up a channel for people to produce CP in a way that is virtually unpunishable.

To me, the attempt to equate child pornography to child sex abuse imagery does not serve any real purpose. People who do this are simply uncomfortable with the fact that there are people out there who find minors attractive, without realizing that only a very small percentage of such people are actually abusers of children. So they try to artificially demonize all images as abuse, even though this isn't logical. The only way to logically introduce ""child sex abuse imagery"" into our legal vocabulary is to treat it as a subset of CP, but not equivalent."	8	16

We can see this with their massively declining brith rates, as people are too socially inept or too focused on work to engage in sex. We can also see this with the phenomena of ""hikikomori"", who are people in Japan that have completely given up on society and have willingly socially isolated themselves. Finally, we can see the commidification of the most intimate social relations in Japan via dating sims, the renting of boyfriend/girlfriends, and other parasocial relationships.

The US will see similar social isolation if current trends continue. Millennials are already [the loneliest](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/8/1/20750047/millennials-poll-loneliness) generation, with 30% of millennials reporting to be often or always lonely, and 22% reporting to have no friends at all. The figure for Boomers is 15% and 9% respectively. Most current polling indicates that Gen Z is even more lonely than the millennial generation. It is because of this increased social isolation that we have begun to see the commidification of personal relationships via services such as OnlyFans. OnlyFans has transformed the intimate bonds of love and friendship into a mere financial transaction, capitalizing on the deep loneliness felt by the current generation of Americans while doing nothing to solve it. The deep interpersonal bonds of the previous generations will be replaced by shallow parasocial bonds, which are insufficient to satisfy the deep social cravings of man."	9	73	0.64

Reason 1: His heart, many like to compare Mayfield to another heisman winning quarterback Johnny Manziel, without reading into their stories. Baker Mayfield was a college walk\-on at Texas Tech and had to work his entire career to be taken seriously. Mayfield will have to continue to work his entire career in order to justify his spot at number one, as opposed to Johnny Manziel who never faced adversity in his college career and got lazy eventually devolving bad habits such as alcoholism.

Reason 2: He will have time to learn: unlike other Cleveland quarterbacks Mayfield wont be required to lead the team in his first year. He will be able to learn the speed of the game behind Tyrod Taylor, a quarterback who has a very similar play style as him. All of the best quarterbacks have had time to learn, a few examples include: Tom Brady under Drew Bledsoe, Aaron Rodgers under Brett Farve, and Jimmy Garapolo under Tom Brady. Only time will tell about both Garapolo and Mayfield but they have history on their side.

Reason 3: He will have some help: Recent brown quarterbacks have been drafted and expected to pull wins out of no\-where, with no help from their receivers, offensive line, and defense their quarterbacks stood no chance. Now with targets like Josh Gordon, Jarvis Landry and Nick Chubb, Mayfield wont have to do all of the work by himself."	0	18

All of the details of this view aren't gender-specific, and thus I'll use gender neutral language. I'm all for gender equality, I'm not religious or socially conservative, and I don't attack people for their promiscuity. But also refuse to date any.

Personally, I disapprove of promiscuity as a whole, though I don't mind friends being promiscuous and wouldn't badger them on about it. It's their life, I'm not their parent or future spouse, they have free range as far as I care. I don't like it, but I don't like smoking either, and I follow the same logic - I don't ""smoke-shame"" them, as long as they don't blow smoke in my face I'm fine with it and I trust them to be adults that know the consequences already. If it gives them pleasure, good for them.

What I do mind is if someone I'm dating is or was very promiscuous, and it is a deal breaker to me. It reveals a big difference on their views of sex - to me it being something important and very intimate to solely share with someone you love and trust in an established relationship. 

It being ""in the past"" also doesn't cut it for me, as it's not a trait I see as being very redeemable. If anything, it comes off as dishonest, that they valued sex so little in the past but are apparently only private about it now. As to what past character flaws are relevant, I would prefer not to date a past cheater either.

Personally there's also a visceral reaction to knowing your partner has shared this very intimate aspect of themselves with so many people, making it cheapened in both of our eyes and not as important as it should be when it is shared with me. I also wouldn't feel comfortable sharing myself, as I'd be another name on a list with lots of other people of emotionally lesser importance. 


It's maybe a very ""Disney-esque"" and idealistic approach to dating, but I really don't think that me having it as a deal breaker is the terrible thing that it's being portrayed as. That I'm evil or weak for being uncomfortable with a partner's ""number"", so to say.

As a side note, I've also read some studies that claimed long term relationships with promiscuous people had less success rates, but I think the core of the view stands as is and it's not that relevant of a thing to discuss, because the success rate isn't what I'm concerned about. "	38	102

However I do not see a problem with it. The whales and dolphins are not killed for no reason, they are eaten by the people. So I don't get why so many people are up in arms over it, when they can sit there and buy meat from the Supermarket that has gone through a lot worse to end up on their plate. The whales here at least have lived a healthy truly free range life. Secondly everyone is complaining how inhumane it is, when in fact the whales are killed very humanely and die very quickly. I don't see why people are getting so distraught over this, yet can just eat supermarket meat that has been cooped up inside all of its life and then been electrocuted and had its neck slit or a lethal blow to the skull. A lot of times animals make it past this stage without actually being dead yet (which has been proved many times through investigations) yet people don't complain over this. I'm not talking about hardcore ARAs, just regular people like you and me. I don't see why people think these animals are so much more important just because the come out of the sea. CMV. 	23	40

This tradition is often mocked, because it was invented by one man in the 60s.  I do not think this fact should automatically invite contempt.

To begin with, what traditions aren't invented?  Every generation unconsciously makes a decision on what elements of tradition to continue and what to adapt to the times.  You can pretty much guarantee that the way our traditions were observed in the past looked very different than the way we observe them now.  This is especially true of mainstream Western traditions, which have been heavily shaped by commercial entities through tv and movies.

Traditions can serve a number of functional purposes in a society.  If there is a need to be filled, it is rational to adopt a tradition that meets this need.  I think that what Maulana Karenga tried to accomplish is noble.

EDIT: Ok, that should cover rule E.  Will be back tomorrow.

I have used the word Synthetic incorrectly in the title. Replace synthetic with non-organic matter. Sorry, that is my fault.

To make the discussion easier, I will separate my points into sections to allow for people to respond more efficiently. Please don't bring up anything related to religion, as I don't think that will have any sway whatsoever.


**Life must come from organic tissue**
As it holds now, almost all sentient life as we know has been formed from what we consider as organic tissue. On Earth, we have found no trace evidence of any kind that would suggest that life could spring from what we consider to be synthetic materials. I believe that it has also stated by many scientists that if we do find any form of life out there in the cosmos, it will most likely have developed under Darwinian circumstances. Synthetic substances seem to not meet the requirements for life to take place.

EDIT** Adding organic matter here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_matter


**Artificial life is made by intentional design and not natural selection** Artificial life, by definition, is creating synthetic life. Every form of life on Earth has gone through Natural Selection. Random genetic mutations within favorable parameters have allowed life to change and endure over time. A synthetic life is designed with a _purpose_ in mind. Even if it is emulating a human, it was designed to do so.

**Mimicry is not identical to actual**
If it quacks like a duck, is it a duck? If we have a scenario where a a synthetic life form passes the Turing Test. does that mean it is alive or does that simply mean it passed a test it was designed to? It may be able to fully copy a human but that does not mean it _is_ human. It's emotions and thoughts are still the product of an intentional design and not random circumstance. It's personality, likes, dislikes etc are not wholly unique. For these characteristics to be genuine, they must not come from someones intentional design but from a process that has worked simply because it has failed so many times before(evolution).

The enlightenment laid the foundation for the philosophical underpinnings of the modern world.
2. This brought the ""Death of God"" *Nietzsche used the phrase in a figurative sense, to express the idea that [the Enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Enlightenment) had ""killed"" the possibility of belief in [God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God) or any [gods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gods) having ever existed.*
3. This left a spiritual gap of meaning, which we replaced with capitalism, the ""American Dream"" (many cultural varieties exist) and science as a pseudo-religion from which we attempt to derive a ""truth"" in purpose for life, of which no rational purpose exists (or has yet been proven).
4. And so we divide the world population into \*those with a personal ideology\* and \*those with an external ideology.\*
5. And since each personal ideology will conflict with another's in same way shape or form.  That is to say the person who believes that gay people should be allowed to marry, will be in conflict with the person who says that simply being allowed to marry is not enough.  
6. We can assume that no group of those with a personal ideology can create a group large enough to reach supermajority, because of the aforementioned conflict and lack of monolithic belief systems endemic to personal ideologies.
7. Islam is on path to surpass Christianity worldwide as the value systems of the demographics of Christianity have diverged.
8. Meaning that Islam will likely continue to grow as Christianity as a religion loses significance. 
9. So Islam will then be the refuge for those who externally seek meaning.
10. Where history has shown that people typically seek external guidance in their search for meaning.
11. Resulting in Islam likely being the dominant ideology in the future barring some other ideology uniting those who seek personal ideologies vs a hyper splintered group of self professed non-categorizable self ideology (who nonetheless will still be able to be stratified and categorized, albeit into many, many groups approximating infinite permutations eg. Trans-exclusionary radical feminists vs radical feminists vs 4th wave feminists etc etc etc) 

Between 3-4 we can also speculate since we have not yet derived a truth in the meaning of life, that no ""truth"" for meaning exists.  Which is why no unity will ever occur in the personal ideological cultural shift."	0	72

No denying that. But the political structure is so archaic it seems completely unrealistic to consider it enviable. In fact the failures of Wakandan politics are the source of each of T'Challas problems.

It is a monarchy, where the only viable candidates are of nobel birth and the king is selected through trial by combat. This is barbaric.

Hereditary monarchy's are incredibly problematic because there is absolutely no guarantee that a great leader will have great children. We've all seen it: kind, successful, hard working parents with morons for kids. Handing someone opportunity based on birthright and bloodline is just asking for trouble.

Trial by combat is also a bad idea, and the film itself depicts the problem when the antagonist claims the throne and the whole country falls into step behind him simply because he was an eligible candidate and (apparently) killed the former leader. The king isn't chosen the merits of his past accomplishments, his opinions and policies, his leadership qualities, or any other judgments a person may take into consideration before giving them ANY kind of power, let alone the keys to an army that could wipe out the planet.

It doesn't even make sense to select military leaders this way, because there is a substantial difference between being a good solider, thinking tactically, thinking strategically and being a leader. Chuck Liddell might be able to beat up every officer at the Pentagon but that doesn't mean he could organize and execute any kind of military campaign, let alone be the king.

Beyond the selection issues, there is no evidence of legal recourse for dealing with an unsuitable king, and there are no apparent restrictions on his power. If a person of poor character takes the throne, which is inevitable with this kind of structure, the only possiblity for change is bloodshed. How is that advanced?

Wakanda can easily swing from Utopia to dystopia every single time a new leader takes the throne, that kind of instability is not good, nor should it be lauded as praiseworthy."	730	163

Even famous brutalist buildings [like these](http://www.dwell.com/design-101/article/6-famous-brutalist-buildings#1) tend to look really ugly to me.  A couple of reasons I think this is the case:

* Concrete, the primary medium of most brutalist architecture I've seen, seems to discolor quickly and buildings with this as an external facade tend to look ""dirty"" and run down.

* The excessive number of protrusions and overhangs look gaudy and attention seeking.  Really the whole thing seems designed to make a building stand out dramatically from other buildings and its environment, which I don't particularly care for.

What are the redeeming qualities (aesthetic or otherwise) of brutalism that I'm missing?  I'm not an architect or anything, so maybe there's some really important stuff I'm missing.

I think this is not only because there's a sense of anonymity but also because there's increasing ways to filter and photoshop  yourself to look like what you think is more ideal. 

Say a person sent an idealized version of themselves into society. You then meet them and they're the complete opposite of that robot. Which do you think would be more accurate to who they TRULY are? To me, it would be the cyborg as it would provide a shield from consequences. When you don't have consequences you're probably going to act in a more true manner.

Since this is there true self I believe they should be judged accordingly. That is to say someone who is an asshole online, is very likely an asshole in real life, so even if you were to meet them in person and they presented a nice demeanor you should still act according to them being an asshole.

The earth has been warming up for at least the last century. This coincides with the industrialization of society and the resulting increase in carbon-dioxide concentration in the atmosphere.

These two things I know, and most people, including the IPCC, say that the later is the cause of the first. I do not share this thought, and am of the opinion that the first is an independent natural event. I like to look at the (in my eyes stable) climate with respect to the time period since the Younger Dryas, and the temperature variations of the past centuries don't appear to be exceptional when compared to this. (Source: http://goo.gl/K0rFMd (I can't find any worldwide average temperature graph on this timescale. Although the medieval warm period, and little ice age do show up in worldwide temperature graphs of the past millennium.))

I don't understand the climate well enough to disprove that an increase in CO2 levels causes an increase in global temperature, not by a long shot. But I would like to see a report that does the opposite. Considering the impact of certain natural events like the draining of lake Agassiz, or the eruption of volcanic eruptions with VEI &gt; 7, I can't see how humans can influence the climate on a meaningful scale.

Now that the hype is gone and media has left the subject alone, I think an unbiased conversation on it is finally possible. The pictures of sad seal-cubs on melting icecaps and unlabeled hockey-stick graphs really hampered the discussion for years.

So reddit, show me why global warming is something big, and why we are the cause of it. 

edit:

I changed my view thanks to one link from /u/NuclearStudent, I am now of the opinion that human activity has raised global temperatures by about 0.6K. I am still sceptical about the size of global warming, since its within natural fluctuations, but I am no longer of the opinion that humans have minimal influence.

Others (France, UK) import much more from EU member states than they export.
* Trade imbalances within the EU drive unsustainable debt levels in deficit countries.
* Within the Eurozone, states cannot tackle trade deficits by devaluing their currency.
* Therefore, surplus and deficit countries should share the burdens of reducing trade imbalances by fiscal and structural reforms.
* Yet currently there is no incentive for surplus countries to do their share, for instance by raising wages or investing in domestic infrastructure.
* The EU’s extant “Macroeconomic Adjustment Procedure” has no teeth.
* The policy should be toughened to impose a fine on surplus countries equivalent to 3&amp;#37; of the value of the surplus.
* At current levels of surpluses this would result in a fine of roughly 4bn EUR per year on the Netherlands and 2bn on Germany.

This sentiment is often coupled with brand loyalty, which biases people in seeing these accusations as valid / invalid. 

I believe that ""copying"" is beneficial and inventible. 

1. Due to the technological limitations of the industry, there is often a most optimal design for maximizing form and function, meaning that even if there was no exchange of information, independent engineering teams would still come up with similar designs.

2. The merit of designs comes from execution, which encourages competition. The same guiding design principle can have subtle variations in optimizations and implementation, which is where the technological competence of the company's engineering team comes in, and where the value of a tech product should come from.

3. brand loyalty is an illogical consequence of this phenomenon. People should make purchase decisions based on features and design, regardless of whether the company implementing it is the original creator of such an idea.

In 1920, the USSR was the first country to legalize abortion. One of many socialist feminist laws it passed decades before the West. Despite the terrible return of the abortion ban from 1933-1955 women still had access to robust state sponsored programs for child rearing.

I always see people say the porn industry is abusive to women. Did anyone consider it attracts women who like just like it rough and want an endless stream of sex?

If money was their reasoning to do porn, they could be a prostitute, take escort jobs, brothels, amateur self-produced porn, stripper, and many other niches. They would make way more money, more discretion, and suffer less of the hard-core degrading stuff popular in professional porn.

Yet with all these other options, porn studios still get hundreds of girls signing up a day. They watch the videos of other girls getting choked out and manhandled by 10 buff well-endowed guys and want to be in her place. They sign up to live out ""the fantasy"" more than for the money. But of course, getting the fantasy sex you always wanted AND getting paid to do it......win-win-win"	0	31	0.23

It is important to delve into the anatomical perspective and prioritize the biology of our bodies when considering this matter. By sleeping on a firm mattress, we can maintain proper spinal alignment, evenly distribute body weight, and alleviate uncomfortable pressure points. This enables our muscles to relax fully, resulting in a refreshed and revitalized awakening.

However, I acknowledge that initially, soft mattresses may appear to be a comfortable choice. The plush surface may seem inviting, enticing us to sink into its embrace. Yet, I have come to realize that this sinking effect can have long-term consequences on spinal health, potentially leading to an unnatural curvature of the spine and causing back pain.

Now, some may argue that the prevalence of soft mattresses in many cultures and hotels signifies luxury and comfort. Advertisements also play a role in promoting soft mattresses, as they are easier to market compared to their firm counterparts. These factors have ingrained a societal norm that favors softness and coziness over firmness.

Despite these influences, I encourage you to consider this intriguing dichotomy. Let us break free from societal norms and consciously make choices that benefit our bodies. Investing in the right mattress is crucial, as we spend about one-third of our lives sleeping, and it can significantly impact our long-term physical health, safeguarding us against various ailments.

Please challenge my view and provide compelling arguments, as I genuinely believe in open-minded discussions and am willing to reconsider my perspective if presented with strong counterpoints."	1	0	1.0

I made the mistake of making such a jargon heavy OP that nobody who wasn't trans could be reasonably expected to understand it.

I think for the most part nobody who isn't trans really needs to know most of these terms. 

I really botched my explanation of it in the op, but basically I think there's no need for cis people to understand non-binary identities, just understanding that people have those identities and respect them.

I think more confusion comes from binary trans people, it's more confusing whether a trans woman or trans man was born male or female than what a non-binary person is.


There are cringey people of all groups and they are just used as an excuse by bigots rather than harming public opinion on such groups




Original OP: I'm a tucute genderspecial and I don't think we have any direct impact on trans acceptance. I'm 26 so I'm a good deal older than the typical genderspecial though.

We are often scapegoated for somehow pushing the trans movement back, but I don't think this really lines up with reality.

Most tumblr genders are cringe. This shouldn't be a political statement or a transphobic one. Most are made up by teenagers trying to figure out their own identities. Teenagers do tons of cringe things and this shouldn't have an impact on politics. I'd argue going after teenagers to make political points merely shows a side is looking for excuses rather than to make good arguments, there's just as much right wing neo nazi teen cringe too.

Almost all adult enbies I know, even ones who are 19 or so aren't very aggressive about their identities. However I'd argue people outside the communities tend to take such identities as being more hard facts than they really are. This includes highly aggressive Twitter social justice warriors who try to cancel people and woke big tech employees who add 50 genders to Facebook.

I believe as a general rule you shouldn't try to fight for a group you aren't a part of, but just fight for the inclusion of such people in decision making. We have a modern problem where activism for marginalized groups goes through a kind of telephone where legitimate and reasonable concerns (i.e. group members say a religious symbol being put on clothes for cultural appropriation) get turned into insane ones (i.e. people who don't have any contract with the culture say using any references to the culture's stories is cultural appropriation).

I think even with enbies being somewhat confusing to the general public the most confusing trans related terms are trans man and trans woman. Terms which I believe were created to validate people's identities rather than aid communication. I'd argue a decent number of people have instinctive negative reactions to these terms based on ontological confusion unrelated to their willingness to respect someone's pronouns.

By contrast the enby identity might be visually confusing to some people but it's not ontologically confusing. There's no argument about whether having a penis is a property of a woman or whatever. An uneducated closed minded person will just see a man or a woman who looks really gay and move on. Certainly some people will be bigoted but it's not as fundamentally threatening.

Enbies do challenge the tramsmedicalist narrative, but I think it's role in increasing acceptance is overstated and it might even be counterproductive and make people see trans people as to be avoided because they're mentally ill"	0	54	0.33

Harassment and objectification of women by men is rampant and unacceptable. #MeToo was calling that out, which was a good thing, but it has turned into something else.

A witch hunt is a mob driven moral panic that seeks to find and persecute persons perceived to be guilty of some sin which the mob is panicking about. The witch hunt necessarily involves the ""witch trial"", in which the mob rallies around the accused and inevitably finds them guilty, with little to no evidence other than that there was some accuser that is to be trusted. For instance, in the Salem witch trials, one accuser was all that was necessary to convince the mob of guilt and result in execution of the ""witch"". Some people were known to have taken out their political enemies this way.

In modern times, Men are being accused by the #MeToo movement, and social media is serving as the witch trial. The mob, in their moral panic, is executing men (their career and character) with little to no evidence, and sometimes with ample counter evidence that the man is of good character, all because the accuser is to be believed."	6	49

Mars has series of properties that make it virtually impossible to be colonized by humans. Some of those include:

* Extremely low temperatures
* Fifty-times higher levels of radiation than on Earth
* No fertile soil
* Almost no resources for producing electricity
* Space dust, which sticks virtually to anything and is electrically charged
* One-third of Earth's gravity
* No atmosphere

Aside from the points listed, astronauts colonizing Mars will also have to face social problems – there will only be handful of them, spending most of their time in a sealed shelter. This, however, applies to the worst places to live on Earth as well (deserts, the poles, mountain regions, underwater, etc.).

The reason for asking whether the least suitable place for human life on Earth is still more viable for living than the best place on Mars is simple – I don't think it's worth it. Even if the conditions on Earth change drastically, this planet will still remain a better choice for the future of mankind. If you know of a place with worse conditions for human life than Mars's on Earth, please, change my view."	231	149

A ""unalienable right"": there is simply no such thing. 

* Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, (or life, liberty and property,) have been declared ""unalienable"", but each of these can be denied by governments, and individuals.
* The right to life is considered the most basic right. But many countries, and all the original 13 colonies in the US , had death penalties.

While I believe that free will and self determination are better justifications for laws than ""divine rights"" or ""because God said so"", there is nothing logically that supposes unalienable, or natural, rights.

I completely disagree. 

I believe if someone is not in a business setting (two coworkers or a boss and an employee) or not acting in a professional capacity (one person is on the job and the other is not [visiting the doctor, teacher/professor, a waiter, the person helping you at Lowe’s]), it is not harassing them to see if they are interested in sex.

Say if you’re waiting at the gate for your plane and you ask another person at the gate if they are interested in joining the mile high club. If you’re at a bar and approach someone and you immediately ask if they want to come back home with you:

I am also not talking about going at it in a foul manner. Like before simply asking, making any sexually charged comments. 

But literally... if you just walk up to a stranger and say “excuse me, would you be interested in x(sexual behavior)?”

That action is not sexual harassment.
Now if the answer is no and then the person continues to proposition them, ask why, why, why and so on, yes that becomes harassment. 

But literally just asking if they would be interested in doing x, is not sexual harassment."	18	231	0.65

As such, I believe the government should guarantee an acceptable internet speed to all citizens, which should automatically increase every year to avoid stagnation.

Or even that his rough treatment was racially motivated. Don't get me wrong, I am not saying the way the police treated him was correct or proper conduct. However, to insinuate that his unfortunate death is due to racism and not at all because of George Floyd's own actions is ignorant and disingenuous. The man was a career criminal. He was high on meth, phentynol, and had also robbed a pregnant woman at gunpoint. When he was arrested, instead of obeying and complying like a normal person, he behaved like a man on drugs (which he was) and tried to fight against the officers and run away. None of this would have happened if he had simply accepted his arrest like a normal person. 

People are dying and businesses are being destroyed in these protests for what? To honor a scum bag by all accounts, who may not have deserved to die, but pretty much caused his own demise. Regardless of skin color, if you behave the way George did when under arrest, you will be treated with force. Race had little if anything to do with his arrest.

It infuriates me that no one even talks about the innocent men and women killed in these riots such as Officer David Dorn who was killed im the line of duty, yet they are immortalizing a career criminal in the media.

George Floyd's Death is being used as a political tool to push an agenda and perpetuate the belief that most/all white cops are racist, when in fact the VAST MAJORITY are good cops.

EDIT: I want to clarify that IMO George Floyd's death was UNJUSTIFIED and the Officer involved definitely behaved inappropriately. I am simply fed up with the portrayal that George's death was entirely racially motivated and not at all caused at least in part by his own criminality.

EDIT 2: I agree that attacking George Floyd's character and giving the perception that I believe his death was justified due to this was a mistake and have changed my mind about this. The reason I brought up his character (or rather lack thereof), is because it annoys me that the media is portraying him as a saint and ignores all the innocent deaths caused by the protests. These innocent deaths IMO deserve far more attention and remembrance than the likes of George Floyd's."	2	124	0.52

And shopping at Walmart because of low prices as a middle class citizen is not unethical.	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/7gkr7b/cmv_fundamentally_and_relatively_walmart_is_not/	"There are two parts to my CMV statement.  

Firstly, what I mean more specifically by the first sentence is I don't think Walmart is necessarily doing anything wrong.  Common complaints include being tough on suppliers to sell for super cheap, temporarily selling at a loss so they can sell at prices so low that it allows them to dominate the area, not paying their workers enough and dodging having to provide employee benefits.

In my opinion, Walmart is really just playing the game.  They're technically not breaking any rules.  Now whether there should be certain rules added (by the government) to prevent these things is a separate discussion, but then that reflects on the government, not Walmart itself.  Business is a game.  And for any game, if you really care about succeeding, you go to full lengths in attempting to maximally do so as much as the rules allow you to.  Walmart is not evil, just extremely clever.  They bargain for the lowest price possible from suppliers.  Who wouldn't do that?  

They have a lot of excess reserve of cash, so they can afford to be in negative revenue for temporary periods in some areas, so in exchange for suffering a slight loss temporarily, they will make their grounds much more favorable by driving out all the other businesses.  That's smart, not evil.  Business is a lot of competition.  These things are going to happen, especially if no rules exist to restrict them.  I'm willing to bet the majority of people would do the same thing if they were in that position and knew that this was a tactic that would favor their business.

While it's true that they may not pay their workers competitively, that's not really any different from many other corporations.  It's not like Walmart is the only company paying near or at minimum wage.  And not giving more hours to dodge giving benefits is something pretty much every company does these days.  Why do you think it's become so hard to get full-time in a retail job these days?  That's almost every company these days.  It doesn't mean it's okay, but I fail to see why Walmart is specifically demonized for it when it's not much different from many other corporations.  

Which brings me back to my point that I made at first: it's not even the fault of the corporations collectively.  The corporations are just maximizing their ways of being able to make profits as much as the laws allow them.  And most people in that position would do the same thing, because by nature, we're greedy.  But if anything, then that reflects poorly on the government or government system, not on the corporations.  If people want it to not be this way, then elected politicians need to add the necessary rules to mitigate these practices.  If there no yellow cards, red cards, or any sort of retaliation against players, then you would see a lot more of players doing things that we would deem as ""unfair"" in order to win, naturally.  The players wouldn't be at fault.  The players are only expected to conduct themselves in accordance with the rules that have already been established, nothing more.  It's the league's job to regulate that to fairness by establishing those necessary rules.  Similarly, it's the government's job to make sure corporations behave.

But like I said, also relatively, I don't see how Walmart is doing anything particularly wrong compared to other corporations.  It may be true that the source of Walmart's products are at their core, coming as a result of them being produced in areas with extremely poor worker rights.  But then again, the majority of corporations are selling stuff that was made in China as well.  And Walmart coming in and forcefully destroying all other small businesses in the area - again I don't see how that's evil.  The government has allowed them to do that.  And if customers value low prices over mom and pop stores, then so be it.  That's the result of people voting with their money and valuing low prices over the presence of small business.  And as a college student who doesn't want to spend more money than I have to, I'm in that boat as well personally.  Why should I pay more than I have to just to not shop at Walmart?

Which brings me to my next point.  Some people have become so self-righteous that they believe the mere act of shopping at Walmart is unethical.  I'm not an SJW and a lot of the time, I think people call things classist when they aren't, but this is extremely classist.  A lot of people are struggling themselves to make ends meet.  Most people don't have an abundance of money, so it's perfectly understandable to not want to spend anymore than one has to on things like groceries, supplies, etc.  And this ties in with the point I made earlier about how If Walmart is crushing mom and pop stores, then it's because it's offering what people want more effectively.  In current times, where the middle class is doing quite poorly compared to times past partly due to wage stagnation, more college graduates working dead-end jobs, growing wealth inequality, and more people living paycheck to paycheck; being able to save some cash is going to matter a lot more to a lot of people than retaining mom and pop stores will.  But even if that's the case, considering that humans are greedy at the core, does one really expect that most people won't value saving money first and foremost?  

So no - just because I shop at Walmart in order to leave more money for me to spend on other things, even if you think the low prices I'm enjoying is due to Walmart's unethical practices and that they as a corporation are at fault for that, does not make me unethical.  And shopping at Walmart even if you're rich is not inherently unethical.  You can't blame Walmart, as a corporation for its perceived evils for reasons I describe earlier, and therefore, you certainly can't blame the consumers for perpetuating them.  Especially when many consumers themselves are living paycheck to paycheck or aren't as well off as before.  "	6	12

He is trying to change his position for the next 4 years of not being president.	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jz2o3u/cmv_trump_knows_he_is_not_going_to_win_any_legal/	"Possible reasons Trump is really extending these lawsuits so long and refusing to concede (in nor particular order)...

1. He is trying to make up the debt he accrued during his campaign. Yes this may sound counterproductive, since legal battles cost so much, but actually he is making a lot of money on this whole process. They have an entire website dedicated to donations for fraud investigation and Trump supporters are pouring in funds to this site. The kicker is that if you read the fine print, most of the money actually goes towards campaign funding, not fraud investigation. Also in fine print, the site is catching people off guard by having them agree to a reoccurring charge of $500 when they are assuming it was a one time donation. The longer he can draw out the fraud claims, the longer he can drain his followers of their money. 

2. Allegedly, the NY attorney general has 67 legal cases against trump that she was sitting on while he was president. She is supposedly going to unseal them when Biden is sworn in. Provided this is true, it gives Trump incentive to fight for another term to avoid this another 4 years while he finds a way out of it. This is what many people attribute to his original run at president. Whether you believe that or not, it definitely looks like a reason not want to leave office. 

3. By claiming fraud, he is able to make it look like he didn’t really lose, giving him a chance to run again in 2024. This theory only works separate from the second theory. Basically, if he can make his followers believe it was all fraudulent then they will come out to vote in droves next election to “preserve democracy and re-elect the rightful president.”

4. If Trump runs again next election, he can be as shady as he wants because he can say it’s to fix the fraud that happened last time. This fight opens the door for him to cheat the system and employ who knows what and then claim it was for the better of our election process. Manipulation at its finest. 

5. By blaming media and the left wing for everything, he is hoping to alienate them so republicans have a clear shot to power for many years to come. If people think the left is committing fraud and getting away with it, people will flock to the right... at least that’s his thinking. This can also help them win the senate this year. Again... his thinking. 

Every claim they have made has been emotionally given on tv for people to see, but then they take a step back in court. They either show no evidence, or they shift their actual stance in court and it’s not about fraud, but instead constitutionality. It’s all an act for the masses so they can get them emotionally upset and on their side. They have no plan of winning in court because they know it’s impossible, so they make it public to push their other agendas. It’s working to an extent too! Many republicans are falling for it and it’s really embarrassing for our country. I hope people open their eyes soon, because Trump will drag us down with him."	9	43	0.64

This is a view that has been growing on me lately, and I don't see a good counterargument. The general concensus has been that women are more oppressed, and while this may be true in the developing world, I think the opposite is true in the developed. Before I begin, I'd like to give the definition of oppression so that there's no confusion surrounding it. As per [dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/oppression), Oppression is the exercise of authority or power in a burdensome, cruel, or unjust manner. Now, continuing to my argument.

# Oppression through current laws

This is the most disturbing to me, and so I think it makes sense to elaborate on this first. The current definition of rape in the US (and in many countries alike) excludes acts where a man is forced to penetrate. This is often labelled as Sexual Violence and for many years has helped to distort statistics, and create the assumption that men are only raped in prison, when the reality of the situation is far worse, and completely unnoticed. For those unaware, the current definition of rape is: ""The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim."". While yes, a woman can rape a man by this definition, the likelyhood of such an event tends to be rare. In the UK, women can't even be charged with rape. When you look at the number of men forced to penetrate, it actually lines up very closely with female victims of rape, as per [a 2011 CDC Study on Sexual Violence ans Victimisation](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6308a1.htm). For those who don't want to look through the study, to summarise, it was found that an estimated 1.6% of women reported being raped in the previous 12 months, while an estimated 1.7% of men were forced to penetrate in the previous 12 months. Despite these incredibly similar numbers, I've yet to see any sort of advocacy for a change of laws from feminists, who purport to be for equality. 

Abortion laws give women the right to choose whether or not they want to have a child but give the father no say. I am pro-choice. I think parents should have the decision, but what I think stands out is that the father has absolutely no say on it. If the father wants the child, but the mother doesn't, the father has to deal with it, and ""move on"". If the father doesn't want the child, and the mother does, tough luck, the father is forced to pay child support. The argument is that ""It's the woman's body"", which is fair, but the issue arises when the father is forced to pay child support for a baby he wanted no part in. 

# Oppression through the courts

The most obvious examples of this are through family courts, and sentencing laws. Many are well-aware of this, so I may skip over this, and address it in the comments, should questions on it arise.

# False Accusations and Double Standards that have arisen

The motto lately has been to ""Believe the victim"", and this has lead to many innocent lives being ruined before having even reached courts. The issue I have with this motto is that it supports the assumption of guilty until proven innocent. I understand that rape is a traumatic event, but a far better motto would've been ""Support the victim"", although by now, it's far too late to change this, and stands to ruin the lives of many innocent men. I'm all for seeing justice when it comes to those guilty of rape, but the idea of believe the victim leads to the societal assumption that the man is guilty, and due to the simplicity of it, it only takes someone that lacks a conscience to point and say ""He raped me"" to have yourself vilified by those that surround you. Even if you find this controversial, and think ""Believe the victim"" is an OK phrase to use, it follows with a huge double standard. Sienna Mae, a tiktok user with a very large following was recently accused of sexually assaulting her boyfriend/ex-boyfriend. For those unaware, tiktok is very strongly in support of ""Believe the victim"". However, Sienna recieved a lot of support, with many people saying that they believe her. Even after a video came out of her looking to be sexually assaulting her partner, there was still support for her. I'm sure there are many other examples, but it definitely infuriated me to see that people were quick to change their viewpoint from ""Believe the victim"" to ""We need to hear the full story"" when it was a female perpetrator.

I could go on. These are the main examples of oppression, and 1 look at suicide rates by gender, graduating rates by gender, homelessness rates by gender, and many other gendered statistics to strengthen this point, and I'll gladly do so, should somebody want me to. I'd love to see some counterarguments to the points I've made here, although admittedly, I don't see any at first glance."	0	232	0.41

And so obviously people think that this is a ""guaranteed job oppourtunity""


But I don't think this is how it'll pan out.
Programming only requires a simple computer you can buy for $30 in India.
So I am 100% sure that the big companies will outsource these jobs to India/China.
It'll simply cost way too much to pay full wage in US/Europe when you can have just as hard working people do it for 1/10 of the price and there is literaly no bi-costs since it's all software. No shipping or material needed."	20	29

Next I am 96% sure I saw a UFO January 10th this year and was by no means someone who believed in random ass UFO sightings, so as to not make it the focal point of debate I'll leave out the details of said occurence unless asked. Lastly, the Phoenix incident is quite bewildering, at least to my curious mind, and the explanation offered was horrendous, which in my opinion is an obvious tell.

Edit: pasted from one of my responses but I feel it elaborates in areas I may have missed:

If I understand the Fermi paradox correctly, then the odds of aliens existing AND us not encountering them by now is so unlikely that there's a paradox for it. It seems to me that it is in fact probable that we are not the only life in this universe, and if that is the case, and I understand the Fermi paradox correctly, then it's actually extremely improbable that they haven't visited us. On top of that, there are quite a few reasons for a type 2 civilization that is working towards becoming a type 3 civilization would leave planets with intelligent life alive and also under inspection. 


And I'm not trying to be an argumentative dick, but let's pretend they're barely a type 1 civilization, with the same curiosity as us humans, which wouldn't look like gods to us. Maybe their technology is only a few centuries superior to ours. Is it so hard to imagine us waiting another 50 years to send the Voyagers into space, only equipped with thousands of disposable drones that are dropped at potentially inhabitable planets to and relay the information acquired back to the Voyager? It doesn't even seem like a stretch to me that other civilizations did exactly what we did just a little more well equipped."	0	122	0.29

The same thing happened to families of victims of the Aurora shootings.  ^[[2](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/da-colo-theater-shooting-victims-harassed-article-1.1257841)]

There are plenty of other examples, from 9/11 to the Holocaust.

While I can't imagine how hurtful this must be to the families and think they should be sheltered from such harassment, I find it hard to find what they do hateful.  It's not like Westboro Church that was going out to intentionally cause pain.  Instead, it seems like they sincerely believe that they are trying to expose a hoax to save everyone else from being fooled.  

Just like I respect the fact that an evangelist even though I find his attempts to ""save my soul"" to be pointless and annoying, I sort of respect the fact that they are doing what they think is the right thing.  And since, in their minds, these events never happened, these aren't real victims who they are harassing.

I also find it hard to condemn rather than pity people who can look at the facts and still come to their conclusions, which to my mind, are completely irrational.

However, because of the harm they do, I would like to feel freer to side only with the victims, so please change my view.

**For purposes of this discussion, please assume that  Sandy Hook, Aurora, 9/11 and the Holocaust actually occurred as described.  If you wish to debate those, please start your own thread.**

Sorry in advance).

There are only a few thousands people planning to cryopreserve their body in the *entire world*. How can that be? Most people want to live and although our present day technology doesn't allow us to live anymore than a hundred years or so, future technology might (and will in my opinion) greatly increase our lifespan, possibly allowing us to live centuries. And once you can live for centuries, you can live forever (more or less) since during those centuries, research will keep going and even accelerate, increasing the lifespan by centuries, and so on. It's like an escape velocity. It might even start by the end of this century. We might find some technology increasing lifespan by a few decades, time during which lifespan will increase by a century and so on! In the future, people might be all biologically immortal! For those people who just died, there were maybe literally a few decades between death and immortality. They were among the last people to ever die from old age or disease after hundreds of thousand of years. The chances of survival after a burial or a cremation are exactly zero while the chances to wake up one day after having been cryogenically frozen are greater than zero. Let's assume it's 1% (and actually it's likely more than that). 1% is still better than 0% if you want to live. What do you have to lose? If you don't have enough money or if you want to keep it for your family, it's completely logical but let's assume you have so much money that you don't have to worry about it. What would you have to lose? (Edit : I mean, once you're dead) There are millions of people around the world who do have enough money to do it so why is there so few people cryogenically frozen? It just doesn't make sense to me. I must miss something."	0	53	0.5

* Allowing people to take the test as many times as they want, which gives an advantage to kids who can pay more tests, because the more you take the test, the more likely you are to do well.
* Selling extremely overpriced ""official"" prep materials which cater, again, to those who have the money. 

If the government were to run the test, the incentive to actually present a fair assessment of each student for colleges would overpower the incentive to make money, and the system would thusly be a lot more fair for economically disadvantaged students, who already are fighting an uphill battle in the college process.

Using the scientific method, there will never be any proof of a diety, or any proof against a deity. Any atheist who says he only believes in science is lying to himself, because it takes a leap of faith to say for certain that there is no god, and you must take that leap without the help of science. To be an atheist means that you know that there is no god. Knowing something so ""subjective"" so strongly implies a leap of faith that would not fit with a man of science.

All across developed countries, people are constantly placed in situations in which the brain has not been designed (so to speak) to fit the increasing demands, distractions and flow of information in the modern world. This has had a large effect on the mental health of citizens. For example, seemingly ""normal"" people can be eventually driven, by what is essentially nothing, to doing some illegal act that they would typically consider to be immoral. This is because the brain's powerful subconscious and it's ability to self-justify. This is typically not a problem, however as social networking becomes more and more popular, the spread of information increases dramatically. Who can you go to when a crazy little idea pops into your head? How can you guarantee that it will stay a secret? You can't, so that crazy little idea festers in your brain. It sounds like a better and better idea each morning when you wake up, until it feels as if it is the only solution to your problem. Just something small would've helped, some anchor to reality, someone to say ""No, that's crazy. Here's a better idea, it's harder, but you're not gonna break any moral boundaries"", best example being pedophiles. It is not their fault if they are attracted to children, no one wants to be attracted to children; however pedophilia is so frowned upon in society, sexual lust mixed with an unchecked increasingly reckless self-justification is the perfect recipe for otherwise normal people to turn into unempathetic child rapists. Just a simple anchor to reality, someone who you can feel safe talking about your thoughts and desires to, absolutely no consequence, can stop people from the cycle of self-justification. But this simple ability to find someone who will stay confidential, is incredibly expensive. Just an hour of talking maybe once a month can save some people.

Just for the simple direct improvement to society, mental healthcare should carry a pricetag far below what it is now.

changemyview	t3_16jc8rc	https://www.reddit.com//r/changemyview/comments/16jc8rc/cmv_you_need_an_income_of_at_least_250k_per_annum/	2023-09-15 12:38:18	Odd_Green_3775	CMV: You need an income of (At least) £250k per annum to live a traditionally middle class lifestyle in London now.	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16jc8rc/cmv_you_need_an_income_of_at_least_250k_per_annum/	"I’m sure for all the Americans reading this, it’s the same in your major cities.

For a person with a typical family, I’d say you could even make a case that you’d need to double that figure to £500k required per annum. 

I met a taxi driver in London the other day who said he’s been working im the same job for basically his whole life, and that his family home was now worth over £1M. He was never “rich” but just bought the house when he was young, and it increased in value.  

It got me thinking about what it meant to be middle class 50 or so years ago. And how that translates into the world today.

£250k puts you comfortably in the top 1% of earners in the United Kingdom. 

Let’s see what £250k buys you today - 

Firstly, after tax your income reduces to £140k immediately. That’s not even counting student loan repayments you have to make. Let’s assume for this example you have no student loan repayments to make. 

You might be able to afford a mortgage on a property worth £1.15M.

Let’s be generous and assume you managed to save for a few years to put down a roughly 15% deposit + pay the stamp duty taxes and pay for any initial fixes the property requires.  In total that would cost you about one years before tax salary in total. If you penny pinch you might save that amount in 5 years. This is assuming you’ve been making £250k for 5 full years already.

For £1.15M, if you’re lucky, you might be able to get an “OK” 4 bedroom house, in an “OK” area.l of London. Lets say somewhere like Brixton (Google it if you want, it’s nothing special). FYI - good luck finding very highly paid jobs in the UK outside of London, they are extremely hard to come by.

Your mortgage repayments + utility bills & council tax etc. will total around £5000 per month. Maybe more now with higher interest rates. 

You pay £500 per month for decent food (most mass produced food will kill you now) and eating out say once or twice per week. 

You pay £500 per month in transport costs. Tube train to commute, a few taxi trips here and there. The occasional train trip to visit relatives in other parts of the country.

You pay £500 per month for a hire purchase deal on an “average” car. A Seat Leon for example. 

You put £2000 per month into your pension pot (You’re advised to put around 12.5% of your salary into it). 

You spend £6,000 per year on two bog standard package holidays per year. So £500 per month roughly. 

Other random costs like clothing, shoes which aren’t poorly made, gym membership, tv license, subscriptions etc. might cost you a further £500 to £1000 per month, realistically. 

And then one off expenses spread over time (like your boiler breaking, or buying a new sofa) would be say £500 per month. 

So all in all, you’re looking at about £1500 left over each month to think about using for dating, buying nice watches, having children with your significant other, getting married, or getting that motorbike/sail boat you always dreamed of. And that’s IF you do everything right. Meaning you haven’t spunked it all on alcohol, weed or gambling. 

If you think I’ve overestimated any expenses here, you probably haven’t lived in London. But I’m happy to be proven wrong."	1	310	1.0

Some might say that it doesn't matter how long we survive, since we will eventually die out anyways.
I reject this notion. We should do the action that brings us the highest percentage chance of succeeding.
If we're extinct, we have a 0% chance of surviving, so therefore survival is better than extinction at every point.

If we want to survive for as long as possible, expanding into space is the only viable alternative. Earth 
will eventually suffer an extinction event that is too big for life to survive, and if we haven't expanded into
space, we will go extinct. If we're spread out in space, a local incident is unlikely to wipe out the specie as a whole.

So expansion into space is the only viable option if we want to survive for as long as possible.

I accepted Jesus as Lord of my life at the age of 13, around the time I started to have attractions towards females and males. I still have some shame about being bisexual because of my familial upbringing and my religion. I read Leviticus 18:22 and it really triggered me. The Bible called me an ""abomination"" for being into having sex with women and men. Faith in God has helped me persevere through times of mental illness and side effects of psychiatric medication. Today I hardly pray, I rarely read my Bible, I rarely think about God, but I still believe in Him as the Creator of reality and existence as well as the forgiver of sins.

I still have negative thoughts about my sexuality to this day and even thought the culture is more accepting of LGBTQ+ people, I still struggle with self-hate for being bisexual and I worry if women want to date me for being bisexual. Lastly, I cannot find a church near me that is accepting of the LGBTQ+ community. All preach ""love the sinner, but hate the sin"" kind of crap. I do not wish to leave my religion even though I am not very devout in it. Without faith in God, I might not be alive today."	1	321	1.0

Honestly, what is the harm exactly in a trans individual not disclosing their original gender identity? I will give two different scenarios to illustrate when this could potentially be on the table. The first, is that of the “online dating” issue. As we know, tinder has no trans option for individuals, and while it is good that transgendered people do at times put that they are trans on their profile, I do not believe that they should have to. With that out the way, let’s continue. To continue with the example of Tinder, with matches made by swiping right, I fail to see how being trans is a present issue. Surely, if someone were to swipe right, that would indicate that they are, or possess the capability to be attracted to that person, physically, emotionally, or both. So, given that you can only message someone if both of you have matched, then why would the trans person's previous state of being a physical man or woman be a topic of worth? Usually people don’t question that someone was once a child, and in a closer vein given personal change that isn’t biological, I don’t imagine it’s often incredibly apparent that someone has gotten a dye job (to a normal color, of course), or attained some plastic surgery of some sort. If people aren’t angered by these people “lying” to them by having a different hair color, having different features, or even being skinnier than they were as a child, then why is it a big issue if someone’s partner was formerly the opposite gender, if the said someone is clearly attracted to their current state? The case involving in person, offline relationship starting is even easier-if say, a man, sees what he thinks to be a beautiful woman, starts a conversation with her and they completely hit it off, begin dating, and eventually get married, at what point is she lying to him? Real life comes with no excuse for “good angles” and “better lighting” or “terrible camera”-it’s in person, and unless we’re counting make up as an excuse (in which case I imagine many biological women would be sorely disappointed) then there should conceivably be no problem. This person believes that they are a woman, as does their partner, and they are happy together. There doesn’t seem to be a conceivable reason why their past as a man, or their biological sex chromosomes have any reasonable part in the relationship, especially when sex is so often assumed from gender. The only time I could see it becoming an issue is if the idea of children was brought in, but I can’t say I know a single person who would leave the love of their life because they couldn’t have children.

In a way, it's even similar to race. If someone could be so tanned, or on the other side so light skinned, that their partner had assumed they were of a different race, or at least a different mix of races (as we know, if one isn’t familiar with a specific ethnic group they certainly can look familiar to others in a different ethnic group-another anecdote, my friend’s grandfather was white, and yet her skin is definitely on the darker end of shading. I never expected that she could be mixed, off hand.). So then, is it also wrong as well for this person to never correct their partner’s idea of their racial makeup?

On a final note, in what way is responding with violence to any admission of original gender, biological sex, or even ethnic make up ever justified? How could sleeping with someone while they don’t know these things ever be called rape?

Most social media platforms serve as echo chambers either through implicit algorithms designed specifically around a user or through explicitly segregated communities like subreddits

2. Social media is easy to manipulate. One troll can have a huge impact, and organizations or governments take this to the next level with shills and bots.

3. Upvoting systems naturally favor extremist and clickbait views. Rational positions not only grab less attention, but do not inspire support. Extreme positions tend to get upvoted on YouTube, TikTok, etc. due to having a stronger emotional impact on the targeted group. 

4. Extremists are the loudest online. Centrist positions critical of both sides gets attacked by extremists on both sides. 

5. Social media distorts reality of users. The real world isn’t close to what each social media platform wants us to think. For example, Bernie didn’t sweep in 2020 like reddit was so assured of.

They are people and deserve equal treatment under the law. 

But...

I've been hearing of people who have undergone gender reassignment surgery suing states to allow them to change their birth certificates to accurately reflect their new gender. Such a move concerns me because birth certificates are scientific records of a medical event. The sex of the baby is recorded based upon physical attributes. Gender reassignment surgery does not change history. A woman who has undergone gender reassignment surgery was still a male when she was born.

I recognize that gender is complex, both physiologically and culturally, but a medical event is not complex. When the baby came out, they had either two or three legs (please avoid conversation about children born with both genitalia - while I understand that this issue serves as evidence of the physiological complexity of gender, it makes the conversation more complex than it needs to be). 

There must be a compromise - perhaps an ""Amended Birth Certificate"" for use in instances when the individual wishes to keep their gender of birth secret filed with the original birth certificate to maintain the accuracy of medical records. 

tl;dr Why is it so important for some people to change the sex on their birth certificate?

changemyview	t3_9d1t9o	https://www.reddit.com//r/changemyview/comments/9d1t9o/cmv_documented_instances_of_police_killing_an/	2018-09-05 01:38:36	MrEctomy	CMV: Documented instances of police killing an unarmed suspect are rare, and not worthy of widespread outrage or protest.	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/9d1t9o/cmv_documented_instances_of_police_killing_an/	"So personally I feel like this issue of police killing unarmed suspects is one of the most misrepresented and most data-averse issues in the country today. With the news of Colin Kaepernick and Nike's new ad, I feel like this is a good time to revisit this issue.

As I understand it, Colin's protest was primarily about the murders of black men and minorities at the hands of police. While many seem to take a side on this issue as far as respecting the flag or allowing freedom of expression, my concern is squarely with the propagation of a data-averse narrative, and how unhealthy that is for the psyche of the public in the United States.

So, there are about 765,000 active duty police officers in the United States. According to Washington Post (source below), in 2017 there were 987 officer involved shootings (a cop killing a suspect). That's pretty bad, right?

Well, of those, 68 of them were unarmed suspects. And I'll even throw in ""toy weapon"" in this number, although if the toy gun didn't have an orange tip I wouldn't fault the officer for shooting. And I'll even throw in ""unknown"", because those could potentially be unjustified. I hope you see that I'm trying to be very forgiving in my estimates.

So, a very liberal estimate of the number of potentially unjustified shootings of suspects by police in the united states in 2017 is 168.

Presumably that is one incident for each officer, so that means we had 168 police officers in the united states who potentially shot and killed a suspect unjustifiably.

So...what percentage of 765,000 is 168?

.02%

So that means roughly .02% of police officers in the US have shot and killed a suspect, potentially unjustifiably. Does that seem like a major problem to you?

But really, the main takeaway for what I'm trying to convey is that people need to be realistic and keep in mind that a vast majority of police involved shootings are justified. It's just that the media loves to rile people up and people want the world to fit the narrative that they prefer. Once you dig into the facts and start researching, the picture becomes clear, but I don't think most people want clarity. I think they want a cause.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police-shootings-2017/

Some counter-arguments I would expect:

1) It's not just the number of killings, it's the fact that they should be punished harshly when it happens.

I 100% agree. I agree that they should be punished appropriately if found to be in malice or gross incompetence, but that's hard to prove. And even for some documented cases of an unjustified instance of a police officer killing a suspect, the circumstances are not clear. Even for cases with video involved, it's at least feasible that the officer was being truthful about thinking the suspect was going to pull a gun. Many police involved shootings take place in areas with high violent crime, after all, where criminals are likely to have a gun.

Whether or not you believe police should be criminally punished even if their actions could be construed as a tragic mistake is another issue.

2) Police should be trained not to shoot except in extreme circumstances. (Possible comparison to the U.K., other countries with low police involved shootings)

The United States is unique in the world in that we literally have more guns than people in the United States. If you look up the amount of guns per capita by country on wikipedia, you'll find that each country has a very low amount of guns per 100 people: only the top 30 countries with the most guns actually have more than 20 guns per 100 people. America has 101 guns per 100 people. The runner-up is Serbia, with 58.

Keep in mind that the United States has a population of roughly 325 million and you'll understand why the police need guns. Of the 987 police involved shootings in 2017, 529 of them involved a suspect who had a gun (156 had a knife, 85 were using a vehicle in a potentially lethal manner).

My point is, we are drowning in guns in the United States, and we have enough areas with extremely high rates of crime, especially violent crime, that the police need guns, since many of the suspects will have guns as well. It is, sadly, necessary.

3) There's a ""culture of racism"" in the police force/systemic racism is to blame for these shootings.

Well I hope I've established beyond a reasonable doubt that these shootings are extremely rare, so if there is some kind of culture of racism in the police force where they actually want to kill minorities, they're not doing a very good job of it. If you want to talk about the police being racist bullies in general, that's a separate conversation. I'm talking specifically about police involved shootings.

4) Minorities are being targeted by police in general, that needs to stop (something about how they get shot and killed the most, disproportionate to their population)

Well this is a difficult issue for someone to prove, because you have to prove that the police are unfairly targeting minorities, and not just that a majority of the calls they're responding in a certain area happen to involve minorities. Unfortunately, areas with high crime, especially violent crime, tend to also be areas with high minority populations. If you want to take issue with that, that's a whole separate discussion.

5) You can't trust data from law enforcement agencies, they're biased and evil.

So then what data can we use? Do you have a better source, or at least a reason to legitimately doubt what data law enforcement agencies release to the public?

6) Any amount of unjustified shootings by police is unacceptable!

I agree that ideally the amount would be 0, but we're talking about 750,000 people working in a country of 325,000,000. They're not robots. Mistakes will happen. Maybe even maliciousness - but the data seems to show that it doesn't happen very often at all. If we say that one out of 5 police involved shootings are malicious, that would only end up being a dozen, I think - which I would deem ""acceptable"" from a statistical point of view.

What will change my view

What will change my view is evidence that there are perhaps a great number of undocumented instances of police killing a suspect, or that the instances we do have show that police seem brash or remorseless as a result of these acts. I would also be swayed if there were data showing that even in areas with small minority populations, the police seemed to disproportionately target minorities (although this isn't my central point, it would make me view things a little differently in general).

But mostly, I'm just looking for reasons to doubt the data I've gathered."	15	120

The sleeper cars are often built from scratch so to speak from very cheap cars.

There have been two times where there have been significant car wrecks during the races because powerful cars lost traction and spun out. One of the wrecks, an electric Datsun lost traction, spun out and crashed into a Mazda RX2, both rare cars. The other wreck a Foxbody Mustang spun out and nearly clipped several other cars before coming to a stop at the edge of the airport strip they were racing on.

If the drag races took place on a quarter mile drag strip that allowed some minor prep work to the track, the conditions would be safer and the chance of cars spinning out and wrecking could be reduced."	9	14	0.69

CMV	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1h8mr5/killing_animals_is_barbaric_cmv/	"The argument ""if the animals don't feel pain when they are getting killed, then its okay"" I don't agree with at all. If you killed a human in it's sleep then it wouldn't feel pain nor know that it was killed. That doesn't make it okay to do. Because the person you killed has a whole life in front of him/her and so on so fourth. Don't animals also have that?

Animals are in many ways like people with a bad case of downs syndrome. Understand me, this might sound offensive but really. Some people with down's are barely self conscious and same with some animals like pigs. Both have some form of feelings. fx. pain and pleasure - so on so fourth. But we don't find it okay to kill people with downs, so why do we feel it's okay to  kill pigs?

CMV	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1qcy8g/i_believe_that_9_times_out_of_10_violence_is_the/	Most of my life, basically middle and high school, i dealt with bullying. And for the longest time i felt all these anti-bullying campaigns were effective means to combat bullying. However, when i came to college, my view on this started to change. I always wondered why we didnt allow our children to learn violence, while a dangerous thing if abused, can be used in a positive way so to speak. If i felt that if i beat up my bullies and would not face consequences because they instigated the bullying, i would have done so years ago. Instead, i felt like i was in a catch-22 situation. If i beat up my bullies, id be in trouble and theyd go almost scott-free. If i didnt tell them, id either have to leave it be and continue to suffer at their hands or let an adult deal with it, removing my sense of control of the situation. I mean, when i looked at things historically, violence has been somewhat of a positive thing. Alexander the Great, while a ruthless warlord, was responsible for bringing Hellenistic culture to the eastern. He was responsible for a cultural genesis only possible through his military conquests. And i know, people ALWAYS use MLK and Gandhi as a counter-point. Bullshit! Gandhi's non-violence was only effective for two reasons. The first was that England was drained after WW2 and did not have the means to effectively suppress/control a country that was basically on the opposite side of the world. I mean, they could barely reinforce their troops in the colonies during America's revolution, a fact that turned out to be a major factor in our victory. And two, they didnt feel it was a viable option to have to waste resources on India, which was colonized mostly for its cotton, when america had a steady supply that was readily available to them. As for MLK, yes he did non-violently fight African-american rights and succeeded. But black people today still suffer from racism and bigotry. Black people compromise a good portion of the prison population, black children in schools are given almost second-hand educations when they deserve so much more. The future MLK fought for all of us, for equality for all people, is still beyond us in this country. To me, it just seems like violence is a necessary evil. We are a naturally violent race. We have impulses of violence in our brains hardwired. No matter how much we grow as a species, there will always be that place in our brains that wants us to be violent, why fight it when it seems so many problems can be solved by its use?	0	71

I am an 18 year old and still a senior in high school. It is already hard enough for me to get a job besides McDonald’s, and raising the minimum wage is gonna pretty much gonna eliminate that too. I understand that for adult employees who have to struggle their way through the adult world without a degree a $15 minimum wage would make it “livable”, but this would change so many things in such a bad way. Of course employers would be much more reluctant to hire anyone unless they’re doing $15 an hour worth of work, they are likely going to lay off employees, and this is only going to give them more of a reason to replace humans jobs with automation when the time comes. If there are teenagers desperate for a job like me who would gladly work for around $8 an hour and an employee who would gladly hire me for $8 an hour, now I can’t even work there.

I had a post about this a while back [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/7qvc3a/cmv_congress_should_change_congressional/) and did have one small view change which I think is largely able to be overcome by using the standard ""two vote"" MMP system.

[A video briefly explaining MMP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Uk44aykGg4) (from the New Zealand electoral commission) if you're not familiar.

The main reason to do this would be as an anti-gerrymandering measure, since MMP is basically impossible to gerrymander.  But it would also give much more possible power to third parties since they could likely get some Congressional seats if they got large vote shares without having to get a plurality to get any seats."	29	45

That's because countless people I trust and respect have talked about OJ's guilt as if it were a sure thing. The circumstantial evidence is overwhelming, and there appears to be very solid physical evidence as well. However, after taking a closer look, there is plenty of reason to acquit. 

For one thing, nearly all of the physical evidence is highly questionable. The single most damning piece of evidence, the bloody glove found on OJ's property, was found by Det. Mark Fuhrman, the ONLY PERSON to be convicted of a crime in association with this case. Not only did he perjure himself on the witness stand (by denying that he had used the word ""nigger""), he took the fifth when asked point-blank whether he had planted any evidence. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Fuhrman#Role_in_O.J._Simpson_murder_trial) 

The other crucial piece of evidence, OJ's bloody socks, were shown to have been contaminated with EDTA, a substance used to preserve blood for lab tests - meaning that the blood on the sock had been collected previously, then planted on the sock. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson_murder_case#Evidence_presented_to_the_jury) 

The only other strong piece of physical evidence are the shoe prints left at the murder scene that apparently go with some very rare expensive shoes that O.J. may have owned in 1993, but hasn't been shown to have worn since then. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson_murder_case#Evidence_presented_to_the_jury)

All other evidence is circumstantial or hearsay. Probably the most compelling piece of circumstantial evidence was the White Bronco chase. OJ had about ten grand in cash, a passport and some disguises. This reeks of guilt, but doesn't ""prove"" anything.

My theory? The planted evidence combined with OJ's erratic behavior leading up to his arrest led the American public to make up its mind as to his guilt quickly and decisively. This case was one of the most highly publicized crimes in the history of the world before it even went to trial, leading to intense pressure on the LAPD and prosecutor's office for a conviction. They may have realized after the arrest that the legitimate evidence was not substantial enough to convict, and as a result bolstered the case against him with fabricated evidence. And for anyone who doubts that a conspiracy this vast could have been carried out... you clearly don't know the history of the LAPD in the 1980's and 90's.

Now tell me... why am I wrong?

Downvotes are not an argument and they won't change my view.


From my understanding of reddit's (and a significant portion of the general public) opinion of Pai. he is believed to be *not only* the second coming of Satan, but also Trump's pick for the express purpose of undoing Obama's legacy. All Democrats hate Pai and all Republicans love Pai.

From the [FCC's website](https://www.fcc.gov/about/leadership/ajit-pai): ""He had previously served as Commissioner at the FCC, appointed by then-President Barack Obama and confirmed unanimously by the United States Senate in May 2012.""

Why would Obama appoint someone who's sole purpose in life is to act against him? Why would Democrats vote unanimously for that someone? Why have they suddenly changed their tune on him?

Could it be that he is an intelligent individual?

Chairman Pai graduated with honors from Harvard University in 1994 and from the University of Chicago Law School in 1997, where he was an editor of the University of Chicago Law Review and won the Thomas R. Mulroy Prize. In 2010, Pai was one of 55 individuals nationwide chosen for the 2011 Marshall Memorial Fellowship, a leadership development initiative of the German Marshall Fund of the United States.

Could it be that he is an experienced individual?

Federal Communications Commission. Deputy General Counsel, Associate General Counsel, and Special Advisor to the General Counsel, 2007 – 2011

U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, Chief Counsel, Chairman Sam Brownback, Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Property Rights, 2005-2007

U.S. Department of Justice. Senior Counsel, Office of Legal Policy, 2004 – 2005

U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, Deputy Chief Counsel, Chairman Jeff Sessions, Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Court, 2003-2004

Verizon Communications Inc. Associate General Counsel, 2001 – 2003

U.S. Department of Justice. Trial Attorney (Attorney General’s Honors Program), Antitrust Division, Telecommunications Task Force, 1998 – 2001

Hon. Martin L.C. Feldman, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. Law Clerk, 1997 – 1998

(who only worked at Verizon (largely a *mobile* service provider, not a traditional ISP) for only two years 14 years ago)

No, clearly Obama appointed him just so Pai could ""undo his legacy"" years later.

I'm going to cite a comment from T_D now. Do not assume anything about me. Do not assume anything about my argument. I did not vote for Donald Trump. See this comment as exactly what it is: a comment that references some of the most egregious offenses committed by ISPs over the last 12 years.

This was despite guaranteeing they wouldn't do it as part of a winning bid on a airwaves auction. They were fines 1.25 million over this.

 - resolved without 2015 law

2012 AT&amp;T tried to [block access to FaceTime](https://www.freepress.net/press-release/99480/att-blocking-iphones-facetime-app-would-harm-consumers-and-break-net-neutrality) unless customers paid more money.

- resolved without 2015 law

2013 Verizon stated that [the only thing stopping them from favoring some content providers over other providers were the Net Neutrality rules in place.](https://www.savetheinternet.com/blog/2013/09/18/verizons-plan-break-internet)

- resolved without 2015 law

2017 [Time Warner Cable refused to upgrade their lines](https://www.polygon.com/2017/2/9/14548880/time-warner-lawsuit-new-york-league-of-legends-netflix) in order to get more money out of Riot Games (creators of League of Legends) and Netflix.

 - 2015 law is ineffective 

This shows a clear trend: Consumers are protected just fine even without 2015's NN law.

Additionally, I could cite all of the years that the internet has existed prior to 2015 as evidence that the 2015 law is unnecessary (not that I am against it).

People say ""look at Portugal!"". I did. From what I can gather, **one** *mobile* provider offered different, supplementary plans that benefitted certain types of use (e.g a streaming package, a gaming package) by charging less for those types of use. The internet was not ""split up"", there were no ""slow lanes"", and it was just **one** *mobile* provider. 9 out of 10 internet connections in Portugal are faster than the US average (19mp/s) [source](https://www.anacom.pt/render.jsp?contentId=1366743) If a lack of net neutrality stifles development by encouraging collusion, why is Portugal's internet better than that of the USA?

Conclusion: Democrats have flipped on Ajit Pai because now he is seen as a ""Republican Verizon shill"", and the Democrat stance on Net Neutrality is alarmist at best.

[The majority of Americans](http://www.newsweek.com/most-americans-think-snowden-did-right-thing-poll-says-253163) think he did the right thing, with even bigger percentages in the rest of the world ([Russia](http://rt.com/politics/rissia-snowden-usa-poll-945/), [Great Britain](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/10/29/edward-snowden-uk-survey_n_4173876.html), [Europe] (http://www.infosec.co.uk/media-centre/news/European-Industry-Survey-2014/), [Hong Kong](http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne+News/Asia/Story/A1Story20130616-430137.html)).
In other words, I think it would be true to say that the majority of the world think Snowden did the right thing.

Snowden doesn't want the people to accept what the government does to them, and many clear thinking people all around the world do not, so why should he not make the next move?

The argument usually is, that should the mentally I’ll person wait a little bit, they will find meaning in life. Those stats are in the single digits. They may regret the suicide attempt at best, but they very rarely find meaning long term.

It is therefore unreasonable to award representation to states rather than people.	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jo6aal/cmv_us_states_generally_do_not_correspond_to/	"This is related to arguments over the electoral college, but the view here isn't directly about that.  Proponents of the electoral college (or the Senate) tend to assert that states need representation (and particularly that less populous states need representation to avoid being overpowered by more populous states).  From the point of view of democracy this is weird -- people, not artificial entities, ought to have representation.  And why should states be given representation but not cities, counties, or any other artificial grouping? Why not award representation to the alumni of particular high schools?

So far as I can tell, the reason to give representation to states is the idea that they represent meaningful communities.  That is, if people in Iowa have meaningfully different interests and needs than people in South Dakota, then it starts to make sense to ensure that Iowa has some kind of representation.  The Swiss canton system, for example, is logical because the cantons correspond to meaningful communities that differ in terms of language and so on.  French speaking Geneva is meaningfully different than German speaking Zurich and needs some kind of protection.

U.S. states once were meaningful communities but with limited exceptions (Alaska and Hawaii), they aren't any more.  There are clearly different communities within the United States and groups of people with different interests: rural vs. urban, racial groups, religious groups, etc.  But none of that corresponds much to your state.  There are more people living in rural areas [in New York](https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/states/new-york#:~:text=New%20York%20covers%2047%2C214%20square,New%20York%2C%20Buffalo%20and%20Rochester) state than there are in [South Dakota](https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/states/south-dakota#:~:text=South%20Dakota%20covers%2075%2C885%20square,Dakota%20(USDA-ERS)),  [North Dakota](https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/states/north-dakota), and [Wyoming](https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/states/wyoming) *combined.*  All of those people presumably share certain rural interests but that doesn't line up with their states.

Americans are mobile.  [Three million](https://www.movebuddha.com/blog/moving-industry-statistics/#sources) Americans move between states every year.  [5.2 million Americans](https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/2013/acs/acs-20.pdf) live in one state and work in another.  Twelve metropolitan areas, including several of the largest (New York, Washington, Philadelphia, Boston) cross state lines.  Metropolitan areas are generally geographically meaningful communities: you have a group of people working and living in the same area and sharing similar concerns and interests on topics like infrastructure and transportation.  State borders, on the other hand, are arbitrarily drawn (at least in the West) and there's no meaningful difference between otherwise similar people who happen to be in different states.

That is, there are many places with a natural connection to one another and some kind of meaningful shared interests.  Metropolitan areas are the most obvious, but there are also connections of the many kinds: say communities along the Mississippi River (shared concerns about flood control, environmental damage to the river, trade along the river) or communities along the Mexican border (border control, environmental phenomena, etc.) or communities that are in areas prone to hurricanes or whatever.  But none of that lines up with *state* lines.  There's a great deal to connect someone in New York City to someone in Newark, New Jersey but basically nothing connection someone in NYC to someone in Plattsburgh.  There's nothing other than a straight line on a map to separate North and South Dakota.

To anticipate an argument: yes, some states (mostly in the East) have an important shared history, but the fact that Virginia was a meaningful community in the 1780s doesn't mean much for today.

TL;DR: States have only a limited amount in common, unlike say, metropolitan areas, so it makes no sense to give them independent political standing."	15	21	0.65

I know from my own experience that not having, I had to make it work. I graduated college and had to pay off my loans. I had to save and make it work. There was nothing to fall back on. Compared to some others in my extended family and family friends. I can see how cushy that ability to fall back made people. They didn't work hard and expected things to be ok. 

So when I talk to girlfriends about this most very much want to help the kids as much as possible. But I don't believe that. I think when you do you ruin their potential. Skills they will have for the rest of their lives and those which make them better survivors.

So, how much money are we talking here? Well, it depends. For a single employee, the average total yearly cost is \~$7,200, and 82% of the premium is paid for by the employer. For a family, the average total cost is roughly $21,000 and the employer pays 70%.

I don't know about you, but it seems to me that health insurance is unaffordable for the average family without an employer covering the majority of the cost.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Companies don't have to pay any insurance costs if the employee doesn't opt-in to paying their share. My company has been able to employ me for thousands of dollars less each year because I was covered by my spouse's insurance. They also got to employ me for less than an employee with a family or an employee who opted for a more expensive plan.

Companies can also save themselves A LOT of money by increasing the cost of insurance, often with the sole goal of getting employees to ""voluntarily"" drop the ""benefit"" entirely. Companies can make insurance unaffordable, for example, by increasing share employees have to pay or switching to plans with higher co-pays and deductibles. Employees that do not ""opt-in"" to insurance don't receive a credit for not using employer insurance to go buy a more affordable plan on the open market. This is effectively giving the employee a massive pay decrease.

And if you get your insurance through your partner's company? Well, if you're married without kids, that's $5,900 a year your employer doesn't have to pay you. If you have a family? $14,700. Imagine how much better of a situation you'd be in financially if you were just given that money as part of your normal wages.

&amp;#x200B;

2. It's already well established that that price obfuscation is a huge issue. With non-emergency issues, it's near impossible to shop for the best provider or pharmacy or hospital when costs seem to be set arbitrarily and are purposefully hiked up so insurance companies can make it look like they saved you a bunch of money.

If you were responsible for paying the full price on insurance, you would be a LOT more motivated to put pressure on insurance companies and Congress to figure out how to lower costs.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Since it ties the health insurance benefit to choosing one of the employer's plans, and employees have no way of claiming that money to go shop for a better plan on the market, then that decreases any incentive to make insurance work better \*for you\* because you are not the customer, your employer is. If Walmart exclusively uses Cigna for their PPO plans, Cigna has essentially claimed a monopoly on one of the largest employers in the country. Cigna isn't worried about how Walmart employees like their services. All they have to do is worry about making the Walmart \*executives\* happy.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no problem with employers working with insurance companies to offer more affordable plans than the market can provide as a benefit to their employees, but make employees pay the full cost and in return increase everyone's pay regardless of whether what plan they choose. That is money they've earned, not a benefit they should have to ""opt-in"" to receive.

And if Congress or whoever is really concerned people will use that money to pay for TVs rather than healthcare, then copy the 401k model -- if you put the money into something like an HSA where the money is earmarked for medical expenses, it also isn't taxable.

Regardless of whether you think we should stick to insurance-based (a la Germany) or single-payer (a la Canada), overhauling employer-based insurance would be a major step toward a better healthcare system. CMV!"	15	2	0.9

I also realize we can get into trouble with interpretations of ""rigged.""  So what do I mean?

I mean that the DNC did not pursue actions to favor specifically Hillary over specifically Bernie to any degree that affected the outcome of the primary.

What I don't mean.

The DNC did not have rules in place that benefit an establishment candidate over another. You can not feel that actions and rules of the DNC were stupid.

My issue with the idea that the election is rigged is that this paints a picture of the DNC working specifically to promote one candidate over the other. In reality, the rules were known beforehand and Bernie and his supporters dropped the ball on following them.

For example, many people complain about the deadline to register as a Democrat. While the complaints that it is unreasonable can certainly be valid, the rules weren't suddenly changed to hurt Sanders, which is the picture painted when it is called rigged.

For that matter, closed versus open primaries. While there are valid arguments that primaries should be open or semi open, you can not deny that there are good arguments for leaving a primary closed in order to let people who have declared themselves Democrats to vote on which Democrat they want, and especially to not let Republicans have a say. I actually stand on the side of semi-closed primaries as best, but I think it is silly to call it rigged.

Voter supression. The primaries are run by the states and the places with the most voter supression are states run by Republicans. Anyone who was angry at the DNC about long lines in a place like Arizona outs themselves as having no clue what they are talking about.

Hillary won nearly 3.8 million more votes than Sanders did, with a total count of 27.8 million; so over 10% of the total. More importantly, she cemented the bulk of her lead on Super Tuesday, when her lead became so great that every primary from that point on Sanders had to win what, 60% of the vote at least just to stay *even*, and every primary he didn't win by that much he needed to win future ones even more decisively. Can you honestly tell me that the DNC rigged it so that Bernie lost by these amounts?

A few more notes on arguments I have heard so far that don't I press me.

Emails pertaining to discussions by DNC members that show bias, such as the question about Sanders' religious beliefs. I think we run into a painfully obvious problem here that he wasn't asked about it. You can certainly argue that the DNC members showing any bias even in private was unprofessional, but people having discussion in private emails does not equate to rigging.

I have also seen people bringing up the DNC acting as though Hillary had already won in May....except she basically had. Frankly the race was over after Super Tuesday without a miracle, and by May that miracle was clearly not coming. At this point if the DNC wanted the best chance at winning the General, they should have pushed far harder than they did to get rid of Bernie. Of course that would have played even more into the image of rigging, and so they let him continue to attack the DNC itself, and let his supporters have a platform to make accusations of rigging.

So, what would it take to change my mind? Frankly evidence that early on the DNC took concrete steps that can be shown to have actually happened to push Hillary over Bernie. Frankly anything done after Super Tuesday would have to be momumental.

Thanks

It goes back to somebody who imprinted on them, like their parents, or whoever first introduced them to their idea of love. Humans just like what they’re used to, or what reminds them of what they think love is. 

I think it’s why people get with abusive partners, and that the stereotype where women prefer bad boys over nice guys is partially true (except I think it applies to a lot of men too, the requirement being that they were neglected early on, not gender). Partners are never chosen based on what is good for them.  

I’m honestly worried I’ll only ever be able to be attracted to and trust abusive people because that is what I am familiar with. 


Are there people with bad pasts who are genuinely happy with a partner who treats them nicely? Maybe, but I believe they still have a tendency to be attracted to toxic people, and probably don’t feel as drawn to their partner as somebody who treats them in a way they are familiar with. I feel like it’s forced because they are mature enough to know it’s best to stay with a person who is nice, but deep down they’re unsatisfied, and would more deeply love a person who treats them the way their parents did.

changemyview	t3_7xptuo	https://www.reddit.com//r/changemyview/comments/7xptuo/cmv_the_us_has_a_rape_culture_just_not_in_the/	2018-02-15 11:44:27	gr4vediggr	CMV: the US has a rape culture, just not in the direction we're made to believe.	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/7xptuo/cmv_the_us_has_a_rape_culture_just_not_in_the/	"General discourse, especially with the #metoo movement, seems to believe we live in a culture where rape is accepted, condoned, normalized or at best ignored. I'd agree with that, just not about women but about men. 

Google definition used for rape culture which seems to be balanced and fair: 
&gt; a society or environment whose prevailing social attitudes have the effect of normalizing or trivializing sexual assault and abuse.

My reason for believing this is two-fold. Firstly this [CDC Report](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_report2010-a.pdf). Secondly the fact that the mere accusation of sexual assault and misconduct can destroy someone's future, but only in the direction of women accusing men. 

To elaborate on the first point. The CDC report mentions the following lifetime rape statistics for men and women.

- Women: Lifetime rape/attempted rape 18.3%, 12 month: 1.1%. 
- Men: Lifetime rape/attempted rape 1.4%. 12 month: too few data. 
- Ratio: 18.3/1.4 = 13.7. 

Seems not too bad right? Then we look at the definition they used for rape which is the classical defintion of being penetrated. Therefore the CDC has included a second catagory which described being forced to penetrate. This is not included in the rape statistics, something I cannot fault them because the definition is different, but it is left out whenever someone quotes it. With these numbers, using a conservative overlap of 50% of the rapes that men experience (thus someone that said he was forced to penetrate might also have said he was penetrated, to avoid double counts). 

- Women: Lifetime rape/attempted rape: 18.3% (21,840,000), 12 month 1.1% (1,270,000)
- Men: Lifetime rape/attempted+forced to penetrate: 5.5% (6,241,500) , 12 month: 1.1%. (1,267,000 )
- Ratio = 3.3. Meaning women are still raped 3x as often as men under these definitions. 

Now first, it is known that this particular study might overreport the number of rapes, especially when compared to other studies about rape by a factor of [10x](http://time.com/3393442/cdc-rape-numbers/), but it doesn't matter because that counts for both men and women. This has been mentioned to me in another CMV post. This study also does not include a good estimate for prison rape--as it mentions itself. Also, I do not dispute the fact that women are raped more often than men. 

Now, the second point is the fact that women that have suffered any form of sexual assault have platforms to help them, and general societal support. I agree that these are necessary--though I have my doubts that someone's reputation can be destroyed merely based on a public accusation and that we actively promote women to make these accusations public (see #metoo). Even if false accusations are rare, we should still assume innocence until proven guilty. Similar discourse does not exist from the opposite sex. This kind of proves that women being raped is *not* condoned, normalized or trivialized by society. 

What about the men? We don't hear a squeak about male rape, which very few people would believe it's only 3.3x less frequent than women rape. Similarly, many people don't know that men have comparable rates of abuse by an intimate partner in general (35.6% vs 28.5%, women and men respectively), though this point is tangential to rape culture. Even the textbook definition of rape is stacked against men, as previously mentioned. 

When looking at the above definition of rape culture, we can understand that there is no culture surround rape for women. In fact, victims are asked to come forward, believed and are taken serious. In media and social media. Opposite, with the numbers being this close, it seemed that male rape sex has a stigma surrounding it and it is trivialised by society as 'not a problem worth discussing'. Exceptions that make the rule were the accusations of priests and Kevin Spacey, which according to the data are only a blip on the radar compared to 'being forced to penetrate' which is a much larger percentage. 

Also, some clarifications: 

- yes, women are raped more often than men
- yes, any rape is one too many
- yes, we should solve this problem for both sexes

Finally, you can change my view by one of the following:

1. Convince me that there exists a rape culture around both sexes. Ergo: convince me of the rape culture for women. 
2. Convince me that the rape culture surrounding men is also false. Ergo: there is no rape culture at all. 
3. Convince me that the definition I used is faulty and another definition is better (and that definition proves either one of the above points). Ergo: my premise is wrong, and a different premise leads to a different conclusion. 

For me, the easiest way would be to convince there is no rape culture. *Which I hope to be true, in fact.* 

I also accept data from other countries, but the US has a very easily accessible data set and though, generally speaking, all crime rates are inflated in the US w.r.t. the rest of the western world, I wonder if the same is true for other developed, western countries. 

*Edit: it seems many focus on the MeToo part of this post, and that may be my own fault for putting emphasis on this. However, I believe that even before metoo this was generally the case. Metoo has helped, and maybe more women decide to come forward (hopefully to the police first! and social media as a last resort). But even before metoo, there was societal effort to help women in all kinds abusive situations, including sexual abuse. While hardly any effort was made towards the other sex and this was largely ignored. Even formal definitions of rape favour one type in many countries (and even a bit longer ago, it was explicitly defined as a man forcing himself on a woman). MeToo isn't my central argument!*

*Edit 2: I didn't mean to imply it was a zero-sum game. It just seemed that the particular definition found that the rape culture (culture being the key word) was only true for one of the sexes. Meanwhile, I have been convinced that a more extensive definition of rape culture might includes aspects that are more true for women than for men.*

'In practice' are key words here. I'm not interested in communism as an ideology beyond acknowledging that I prefer it to fascism. When I say communist, I mean countries and regimes that aspired to communism and saw themselves as communist. I acknowledge that no country ever actually achieved communism as Marx envisioned. 

**Part 1: Fascism is generally a more clear and present danger.**

I base this on the following observations: 

Fascist states generally come about via elections and/or military coup rather than full scale revolution. They, therefore tend to come about in MORE peaceful times than communist regimes because more widespread disruption is required for the latter. Nazi germany, for example compared to the soviet union. Therefore, there is a wider 'sweet spot' for fascist regimes taking hold than communist ones. 

Secondly, Fascist regimes are more compatible with a typical capitalist society than communism and specifically more compatible with the powerful people in those societies. Think corporations in nazi germany and the church in spain. Therefore, the people with the most to lose are more likely to follow the carrot of fascism, especially if they are scared of the stick of communism. 

Thirdly, and honestly the one I'm least sure of, fascism is a more appealing idea to most people if you take away the word fascism and its connotations. People think in terms of 'us and them' and the 'other'. People are receptive to ideas of their people being a special people and having a special destiny. They like 'strong' leaders. I'm not saying that everyone is down with genocide but it usually doesn't start with genocide. In other words, the soil is more fertile when it comes to fascism. 

**Part 2: Communism is worse than fascism in practice** 

This is a more long term argument. I don't think communism is worse because they have a larger kill count. That's mostly a result of just how long those regimes survived than anything. I think they are both equally bad when actually happening. 

My main reason why communism is worse, is that it is much easier to become a democratic country again post fascism than it is to become one post communism. 

Communism pulls down the pillars of society and then fails to replace them with anything likewise. Then if communism fails, those pillars arent there to recreate a democratic society. Fascism tends to subvert and repress some of those pillars but they are still there at the end. 

I'm very interested in the replies. These are views I've held for a long time but never articulated so clearly."	0	129	0.44

If you look like a girl and I call you a girl or use her or something I shouldn’t be scolded because you identify as something else. I could easily say I identify as king and anyone who doesn’t call me king or my royal highness is sexist or something. Why aren’t you happy with being either a girl or a boy? It just creates confusion. This also could be a misunderstanding on my part. I personally can only imagine 4 genders and 2 sexes.

CMV.	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1tw4n2/i_think_that_most_atheists_are_actually_religious/	"The title is slightly methaphoric and link-baity, sorry for that.

Religion is basically a theory that's based on a set of completely groundless assumptions, axioms or dogmas. It's irrational to act as if these assumptions were true. But most atheists actually believe in one ideology built upon groundless assumptions – ethics.

Let me give you an example. Let's say I'm a psychopath (I'm not in real life). Is there any rational reason not to secretly torture rabbits just for fun? Or, is there any rational reason not to steal money from blind beggers when no one is around?

I guess most people would come up with an argument like ""Yes, harming others is wrong."" The problem is, that this is a completely unfounded assumption. It's almost a religious, dogmatic argument.

It's important to make a distinction between two cases here:

1. ""I will not steal from the blind begger, bacause I'll feel guilty afterwards"".
2. ""I will not steal, because harming others is wrong.""

The first is a completely rational view. It makes sense to avoid acts that make you unhappy. The second one is what I'm actually talking about. I think that most atheists *believe* in dogmatic statements such as ""there's a rational reason not to harm others even if it doesn't make you feel bad"".

The age difference is minimal (zero to two years), and so is the typical difference in maturity level. Of course there are particular cases or circumstances when it would be unethical, but not in general.

TBH I thought this was uncontroversial, but I occasionally come across people in social-justice subreddits and spaces who believe that *any* act of sex between an adult and a child is unethical, regardless of the ages involved."	8	42

To be very frank, I feel very guilty about cheating. Throughout the years, I've been living at home, working jobs, trying to get done with this degree so that I could leave already.

Well, needless to say, most of my classmates are in the same boat as me. And for several years, I thought I was the only kid struggling...until I discovered that half the class was in on a cheating ring.

The professors are apparently very aware that cheating is quite rampant in our program. With a certain peice of information, I could expose us all and have us reap our just desserts. 

This would kill my shot at grad school and sink everyone else; but it would assuage my guilt and finally let me breathe easier.

You might argue that what I'm contemplating is selfish, but what about this isn't? Literally 20/25 are cheating in my course. When I say it's rampant, it's very rampant, and when I say it's hush-hush, it's very hush-hush.

To be honest, I shouldn't ever have joined this program at seventeen. I didn't know what I wanted then. Now I do. And to be more honest, half the people in this program don't belong here. More than half.

We basically do only 3 things when we’re naked, change clothes, shower, and have sex, which one do we do most often? Definitely not changing, twice a day, let’s say 2 minutes each is 4 minutes, so basically nothing, I’m not sure exactly how much people have sex but I’m guessing every 1-3 days, and I’m guessing the average is 10-15 minutes, and I’m guessing the average shower length is around that as well, we shower every day aswell, so yes technically sex isn’t the most common thing we do while naked, but still, it isn’t too far behind, and showers can be sexualized, many people have sex in the shower (although not a majority) and lots and lots of people think that bodies covered in water is hot.

So, basically when you’re naked, it’s mostly sexual, so then how is a nude not sexual? I just don’t get it, I want to be more respectful, but I just don’t understand it wouldn’t be sexualized.

Even with hours of talking and research shared to prove racist ideals and practices, they might agree but because they cannot relate personally, it’s not important to them. Putting yourself in the other persons shoe fails in this regard. 

I’ve spent hours with people explaining how systemic racism still exists in the US and is a major problem but it all falls onto deaf ears. From statistics to journals, statistics, it seems like people would rather generalize others and blame them instead of accepting responsibility for a system they contributed to that works against blacks and other POC. For instance, food deserts. That still plays a major role in the health of those in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods. Instead of actually working with policies to change things and improve, folks are blamed for eating badly and fast food when the reality is they have no access to healthy options and fresh food. Also, as many struggle to make ends meet, how can anyone assume they would be schlepping to Whole Foods to buy organic goods that their paychecks cannot cover. 

And that’s why the US is still where it is today in dealing with racism.

I get the idea. To make the dominant class take themselves less seriously and make the oppressed class take themselves more seriously, until the playing field is even. 

So when Katy Perry basically forces a guy to kiss her, it’s okay because men are to take themselves less seriously. But if a man forces a girl to kiss him, it’s not okay because women are already taken too lightly. 

I get the idea I really do. But lately it seems as though women won’t stop until men are basically jokes and women are deities. 

Same goes for Blacks and Whites. Has there ever been, or is there currently any social class based issue that isn’t about reverse dominance in the name of evening the playing field?

Seems to me like social classes are just insecurities being raised to art forms until there is something else to band together and complain about. 

Edit - Someone brought my attention to the actual numbers and they basically make the idea of reverse-dominance moot. So topic closed folks. I’ve changed my view.  (Don’t know if I’m doing this right.)

Assad’s a tyrant and has zero understanding of human rights. But SAF also holds 2/3rds of Syrian territory. At this stage, nothing short of several more years of prolonging the conflict will topple him, so it’s best if all parties just accept that his hold over Damascus is unwavering. 

SDF has fought valiantly against ISIS over the years, and Syrian Kurds deserve autonomy, but they can’t hold off Turkey on their own. Trump doesn’t want to help them anymore, so an agreement with Assad is their only hope for survival. They control one fourth of Syrian territory. Together with SAF, that’s over 90% of all Syrian territory. If SDF and SAF ally with each other, they have the best chance of fending off a Turkish invasion. With Turkey out of the picture, the remaining rebel presence will be so low it’ll be more of an insurgency than a war, and reconstruction can finally begin. Here’s the potential downsides to an SDF-SAF peace deal: 

1) Assad will almost assuredly want revenge against SDF for taking up arms against his regime and might not abide by the peace deal. 

2) Rojava’s bargaining power will be reduced and they won’t be able to negotiate the kind of autonomy they want to protect Kurdish interests and keep their revolutionary political experiment going. 

3) SDF would’ve betrayed the US by aligning with Assad (even though the US did it first) so there is no hope that NATO and it’s allies will enforce a post-war no-fly zone to protect Rojava against Assad (in case he decides to start a genocide) like they did with Iraqi Kurdistan in the 90s. 

Nonetheless, I think it seems to be the most viable and the least deadly of all options. Assad isn’t going anywhere, and Syrian Kurds have a lot more to lose under Turkish occupation/prolonged war than under an imperfect and fragile autonomy under Assad’s regime in peacetime."	6	1

Let's break down the numbers. Suppose a modest UBI payment of $1,000 per month per adult citizen. In a country like the United States, with approximately 209 million adults, this would total to over $2.5 trillion annually.

To fund this, governments would need to significantly increase taxes. This heightened tax burden would disproportionately affect the economically productive segments of society, potentially discouraging investment and entrepreneurship. Isn't it counterproductive to penalize productivity for a program that might disincentivize work?

Injecting such vast sums of money into the economy could also lead to inflation. When everyone has more money, prices rise. If the value of money decreases, doesn't this nullify the very purpose of providing additional financial aid?

A UBI could lead to a decline in labor force participation. Why? Because it removes the primary incentive for work: financial necessity.

If people are guaranteed an income without the need to work, a portion of the population will inevitably choose not to engage in employment. This decline in workforce participation could lead to a decrease in overall productivity, an essential driver of economic growth.

UBI could potentially create a dependency culture, where individuals rely on government handouts rather than seeking employment or creating economic value. Isn't a society where a significant portion of the population is unproductive and dependent fundamentally weaker?

The psychological implications of a UBI are profound and concerning.

Continuous, unconditional financial support could erode intrinsic motivation. The challenges and rewards of meaningful work are key drivers of personal growth and satisfaction. If these are removed, wouldn't society risk fostering a population less driven to achieve and innovate?

Employment isn't just about income; it's also about social interaction, contributing to society, and a sense of purpose. UBI might inadvertently reduce these non-monetary benefits of work, leading to issues with self-esteem and social cohesion.

Isn't it wiser to invest in education, skill development, and job creation, thus empowering individuals to contribute to society, rather than making them reliant on state handouts?"	1	80	0.37

I don't want to frustrate anybody with my title but I am at this point of my life where I need to gather a few reference letters. I am university student who wants to pursue graduate studies. However, at this level, you don't really know your teachers like you used to in high school. I am a strong believer that the reference letter ""system"" is old and needs to be replaced. I think that asking a reference letter from a complete stranger (a professor) is insincere both from the student and the professor's perspective. In others word, even if the professor and I get to know each other, there's no way this person can really know who I am.

I know the argument which is get to know your professors or get involved at school to be noticed. I think that getting involved in order to get that piece of paper is selfish. It's like working somewhere for the social benefits. (best analogy I could find) To sum up, I think that post-secondary education is a time of your life where you should focus on your studies  instead of spending time on trying to build a ""fake?"" reputation.

My point is not that we should abolish the reference letter ""system"". I just think that it's not the right way to evaluate if someone is really hard working.

As a Syrian, I am probably heavily monitored by the NSA, and I don't mind whatsoever.

I don't see why Americans make this such a big deal. I promise you no one's sitting at the NSA office right now reading your texts to your friend about getting high later and planning to arrest you. They're looking for things that will help your safety and well-being and it's for the good of us all.

Here's Trump's first 100 days in office, summarized:

-Appointed Scott Pruitt, a climate change denier who receives money from the fossil fuel industry and attacks clean air and water rules, as the head of the Environmental Protection Agency.

-Halted Obama-era plans (Lautenberg Act) to limit toxic chemicals and create a safety net for Americans.

-Proposed to slash the EPA's (which is now a joke already) federal budget by 1/3rd.

-Gutted rules (alongside Pruitt) prohibiting arsenic and mercury gas in the air and carbon emissions safety standards.

-Taken aim at the Clean Power Plan and offshore drilling restrictions.

-Wants to sell off National Park land (Yosemite, Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, Grand Tetons, etc) for presumptive oil drilling and mining. (This one pisses me off the most)

This is just the tip of the (melting) iceberg of what Trump has done. The GOP used to be simply apathetic about the environment; it's now outwardly hostile. Thus I feel that no other entity, foreign or domestic, is a greater threat to the general public's health and America's natural beauty. Can any conservatives out there CMV?

Chief among them is the importance of credit. One of the first things that employers and landlords check is a prospective employee’s and/or tenant’s credit. Students are completely consumed in regurgitating information from textbooks and wondering where the next party is that they don’t realize that credit is going to be one of the most significant aspects of their life. They may not even know what credit is. This is something that effects their employment and a roof over their heads. Failure to acknowledge this before its too late can make their entire college experience moot. They will end up spending them majority of the next 5, 10, even 20 years trying to dig themselves out of debt. They won’t be able to save money because the interest rates on their car loans and mortgages (if they’re lucky/responsible enough to have one) are so high that their monthly payments are so high that they don’t have room to save for retirement or even go on vacation.

For example, I saw a post yesterday of a police officer tackling a man who was chasing a bicyclist during the tour de wherever it was.  Redditors generally were in approval of this, even though it wasn't clear how he posted any danger to the cyclist or the video bikes behind him.  It would have been easy enough to catch him in a way that didn't endanger him or anyone else, but the police officer used all of his strength to tackle him.  This is not an uncommon response to streakers - and some get [even worse treatment ](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwicxrCEqrnWAhVq54MKHX8bDnUQtwIIKDAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D7aHlxv4LP3o&amp;usg=AFQjCNGiluvPqh2fC1Mouo6bM8bJThKzUA0).

This level of violence is completely unreasonable to me because they pose no harm to anyone, and even if they would act in such a way to change a sporting outcome, violence that could result in serious injury or death to them would still not be reasonable (choke holds, or tackles by or against people who do not training of how to do so can both lead to death).

Fines can de-incentivize anyone from streaking, and there should be enough people to eventually surround the streaker such that a tackle is not necessary to end the streaking."	14	67

After all this time, I've come to two conclusions that underpin my current opinion:

1. Israel as a state primarily of and for Jews isn't going anywhere unless quite literally forced to, which is not happening.
2. The opinions of who the bad guy is in this entire thing seem to come down to the ""level of zoom"" one takes of the conflict. People who see it as isolated to Israel vs Palestine seem to mostly be pro-Palestine. People who see it as Israel fighting for its safety in a wider (somewhat unfriendly to openly hostile) geographic area tend to be pro-Israel.
3. Pro-Palestine people seem to believe that Palestine would flourish if it weren't for Israel keeping Palestine subjugated in an apartheid-style state.

Hence, my proposed solution:

1. Israel stops its attacks on Gaza. Hamas releases all the hostages.
2. The UN puts together an international ""police force"" consisting of countries that support Palestine and places them in both Gaza and the West Bank. This police force has two jobs - to keep Palestine from attacking Israel or Israeli settlers already in the West Bank and to keep Israel from interfering with Palestine in any way.
3. Israel's naval blockade gets restricted to only confiscating arms. Apart from that, Gaza can start freely participating in naval trade.
4. Until local self-sufficiency is achieved, Israel must provide Gaza with water. Everything else (except arms) can be provided by anyone/everyone else without interference from Israel. Whether Israel allows that trade to flow across its territory or not is Israel's decision.

The rationale here is simple. If the main reason why Palestine cannot prosper and grow peaceful is that Israel is truly keeping a boot on Palestine's neck, that boot is immediately removed.

There's a caveat, however. If attacks on Israel continue at an annual rate or with damage that's higher than the average of the preceding x years, Israel has the right to solve the situation however it sees fit. 

I'm absolutely open to changing my opinion on whether this could work as a way to bring peace to both and prosperity to Palestinians as well. 

There are, however, 2 arguments that won't change my mind:

> It's not fair that Palestine has to accept the two tiny specks of land in what's a de facto two state solution that's much worse than any of the previous ones.

Well, perhaps it's not fair, but neither life nor history are fair. There's a ton of countries on the planet with territorial claims that won't ever get fulfilled. Hungary would ""ideally"" triple in size according to their irredentists. China claims a ton of land and sea all over the place. And this doesn't even begin to describe the claims Native Americans could make.

The current situation is such as it is and having people stop dying and helping Palestine become prosperous is more important than land claims.

> If Palestine grows more prosperous, that would mean they'll become more dangerous to Israel as well.

Could that happen? Yes. But, first, it's the job of the ""UN Police Force"" to make sure it doesn't and second, since Palestine would have international safety guarantees conditional on pacifism from, hopefully, the US as well, any arming of Palestine beyond building its own legit police force could be considered a casus belli by Israel, which would void the entire deal and then Israel could respond however they'd like.

There, that's my position. I'm curious to hear why it might not work."	4	15	0.67

The media is portraying this to be a terrible thing but I think for a president it shows good traits. I don't think we can expect someone to be familiar with all of the world events, most politicians would have dodged the question or made up a vague answer. In my opinion the president should ask if he's not 100% sure. I want a president who is willing to learn and hear others opinions. He wanted clarification before he makes an opinion, that seems more responsible to me. I see how it could make him seem uneducated but if he's not why should he be afraid to ask? I want to hear the flip side to this so please CMV!

Edit: sorry for the slow responses in at work I will definitely get to more later tonight, but I have seen more points, such as he could have partisan people giving him the information.

When you're teaching something, you have to know what you're actually teaching, in depth, to be able to give someone the knowledge. As someone who educates the juniors in my team at work, I find that I can't really explain something until I fully understand it, and I can't fully understand it without hands on experience. 

I'm infinitely more knowledgeable, working now, than I was fresh out of college, when really, I knew just some theory. I imagine going into teaching at that point, and I can't help but feel I would've been a very uninspiring teacher, because I think kids really pay attention when they understand stuff, but lose interest when they don't, and feel like they never will ""with this fucking teacher"". Most teachers have no/minimal experience with their subject, so how can they be of any use? 

Math is a good example of a subject that really needs to be taught from ground up, and with historical context. It's also important to show kids the actual real life application of math. Yea, most math teachers just tell you some formulas. No wonder math is stereotypical ""the worst"" and ""I hate it"", because it probably requires one of the highest degrees of preparation before being taught, beyond just theory.

Anyway you get the gist.

&#x200B;

*Clapback 1: ""But knowing and being an expert doesn't translate into being a good teacher that can convey information""*

I don't think there's a universally recognized good way to make people good teachers. If you think that's what the pedagogical module is for...lmao. It's mostly just a waste of time ""you pass, get out of here"". Granted, I didn't finish it, but I still attempted it. 

People can train their teaching ability but I feel like some people are more interested about it than others, some people have better social skills, and that matters too. There are many factors. I feel like the ability of being able to teach well is spread throughout the population. Just because you're a teacher doesn't mean you can teach. Just because you work at a corporation doesn't mean you can't. 

So who would you rather have teaching you? A good teacher with real life skills? Or a good teacher without real life skills? Keep in mind, most teachers aren't good teachers, and don't have real life skills. And people wonder why education is so bad.

*Clapback 2: ""You mentioned math, but for some other subjects what you said makes less sense. What about foreign languages?""*

What about them? If you work as a translator (of books, live), or editor, etc. you will probably know more regardless, and get in contact with the culture as well, which is important. Still WAY better than learning a language and going straight into teaching after college.

I don't think that there's a subject where teaching isn't greatly improved by hands-on experience for years and decades.

*Clapback 3: ""Ok, so then who is gonna teach the children?? Someone has to, dismissed.""*

Someone like me who isn't considering teaching, because it pays so bad (and other reasons: in my country at least you also have to deal with politically placed school directors for instance). It pays bad, because it's so easy to become one and the quality filter is non existent (yea, someone had to say it). But I would gladly teach for a couple of months, as a break from what I do. And I'm sure A LOT of people would. 

There could be a system where people sign up for a class for just a semester. Or other systems, who knows. Discuss.

&#x200B;

Anyway, post your other clapbacks below."	1	72	0.27

Recent goings on in the US have brought to forth a lot of issues with Christianity, namely its roles regarding bodily autonomy and treatment of gender and sexual minorities. Someone I follow on Twitter said that abortion bans and restrictions violate Jewish law because Jewish law puts the life of the mother, not the child, as paramount. Things like this have me thinking that Judaism, probably the least cruel of global religions, has issues inverse to the religions that grew out of it.

When you think of Jewish leaders, who comes to mind? Sane, liberal, modern voices or reactionary wackjobs? Unlike other religions, it's the former with the latter self-segregating, far from the spotlight unlike Christianity and Islam.

Christianity and Islam attack homosexuals, Judaism welcomes them and Tel Aviv is a major LGBT tourism destination.

Christianity and Islam subjugate women, most sects of Judaism see them as equals and even those that do not see them as a sacred figure.

The bad Israel does often ends up swept under the rug, the same is not true of nations of an Islamic majority.

Judaism sticks to its guns. Not even genocide could lead them to seek converts. This while Christianity and Islam seem a bit tainted and watered down.

As Christianity seems to look worse and worse, especially in the US,  and Islam is perpetually misunderstood, Judaism's issues are peanuts in contrast and are the inverse of its peers. CMV."	0	27

Fat people are the target of discrimination and bullying due to their weight, which is undeniably wrong. But *promoting* fatness is not the way to support fat people. 
I understand that defining health is a complex issue and it's not as easy saying ""that person has some extra lbs, therefore they aren't healthy"" but the fat acceptance movement's sheltering of obesity normalizes poor health. Obesity is a serious problem and the fat acceptance movement allows us to bypass facing the obesity epidemic as a society. There are major systematic changes that we, as a society, need to address in order to have a healthier populous, and accepting that obesity is okay or promoting it is a barrier to the hard work of changing the way our culture treats food, diet, and exercise. 
People deserve respect, but part of that respect should include real discussions about weight and finding better ways to support people.

Edit: To illustrate a few examples of the trends I've seen and point out the difference between the intent of the movement and the byproduct(s) of it- (I'm on mobilize so I apologize for formatting)

There are a number of fativits who write about how being fat is good, I've interpreted that as promoting fatness/obesity.
Examples:
 [I'm FAt. It's OK](http://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-22468/im-fat-its-ok-heres-why-we-all-need-to-get-a-little-more-comfy-with-the-f-wo.html)

[Photo Series Proves Fat is Beautiful](http://www.glamour.com/gallery/adipositivity-project-photos)

[Glorifying Obesity](http://www.fatgirlflow.com/glorifying-obesity/)

You can find [Fat is Fabulous](https://www.tumblr.com/search/fat%20is%20fabulous) posts all over Tumblr and other social media sites. 


I think the difference here is the original intent of the movement. I see that the intent of the movement is to end discrimination against fat people, but I think many individuals use that as a scapegoat to normalize obesity. Cathy Young wrote a succinct article that reflects my thoughts that may be a better descriptor - [Pro Fat An Unhealthy Status Quo](https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2013/12/30/fat-acceptance-hazardous-health/1ojfoW46R2elWpHLarA19M/story.html)

EDIT 2: POST CMV -
A number of people have illustrated the difference between the fat acceptance movement and the fat *people* acceptance movement, which is the key differentiator for me. Yes, there are radicals (as in any movement) who take the message further to say that obesity (the illness) is healthy, which is not true. But as I understand, the moderates of the fat acceptance movement simply aim to normalize the existence of obese people in an effort to make their lives less hellacious. There are a lot of people who are hung up on the normalizing aspect of this thread and who have pointed out that of course the movement aims to normalize obesity. I posted this thread with a common understanding that obesity, the illness, is bad, and should not be upheld, glorified, promoted, etc... That said, I understand there are differentiating interpretations on the word ""normalizing"". I see the point that normalizing doesn't always equate to condoning, as in, we should normalize mental health issues, but that does not mean we glorify mental health problems. Thus, I think my real issue here has been associating the movement and it's intent with radicals. I would, therefore, appreciate links to resources that are upstanding representations of moderate thinkers of the fat acceptance movement. Thanks to everyone for your input, thought provoking conversation and for changing my view! "	1728	335

Her video ""anaconda"" shows her overflowing with sexuality, but all of the lyrics and imagery is about female sexuality for the sole purpose of pleasing a man. Her role as as someone in the ""body-positivity"" movement is skewed because she shames skinny female bodies, AND she her confidence in her own body is artificial. Her body confidence comes from a place of insincerity because she has had multiple surgeries so that her body looks a certain way. She is not confident in her body, she had to have it changed. This is a negative message to be telling young girls, and the opposite of what feminism and body acceptance is all about. I know the video did not come out recently, but I *still* hear Nicki Minaj synonymous with Feminism and women's rights, so I think this is still a relevant topic.

President Obama made some statement along the lines of (keep in mind I'm paraphrasing)""A woman should not have to pay more for health insurance simply because she's a woman.""

Now while I don't disagree with this statement, I do believe it reveals a double standard in society. All other factors being equal, men can pay on average $358 more on car insurance. I understand that statistically men get into more accidents than women. But statistically women also have higher health care costs due to pregnancies, periods, and other issues. So why does the logic only apply to one group?

Furthermore, if hypothetically you were to charge any group of individuals other than men a higher rate of insurance due to statistics, all kinds of human rights activists would be jumping down your throat screaming discrimination. If hypothecially, statistics showed that black people got into accidents more so than whites; insurance companies proceeded to charge blacks more based on that, they would get universally shamed and branded as racist. Same goes for hispanics, women, or any other demographic. So why are men the only demographic that is appropriate to discriminate against based on statistics.

EDIT: A key interesting point I believe has emerged which sets up some interesting dynamics for this debate. The main argument against my view seems to be that health insurance is mandatory while car insurance is not. But I will copy and paste an interesting point made by /u/redbrassdart

I have to disagree that it isn't a necessity, as someone who lives 5 miles from the nearest convenience store and 35 miles from the nearest town where one could find employment. In fact, I have deliberately chosen car payments over health insurance in the past. It is more of a necessity to me.

In a sense, car insurance is a neccesity in order to have any shot at a decent life in the states. If we were debating about Europe or a country with good public transportation that'd be different. And many people have still gone without health insurance. It's not mandatory to the extent that you can go to jail for not having it.

EDIT: A common argument I've seen is that women getting pregnant is somehow not a choice but men driving recklessly is. Here is a good response from/u/dejour

EDIT: First off, I'm amazed and surprised at how fast this thread blew up. I'd like to thank all who participated in this productive debate. As for my opinion, it at first changed because of the most common objection I've seen here: healthcare is mandatory and a neccesity while car insurance us optional. However I have since changed my mind again due to a strong counter-argument which has surfaced towards that, which is, why is discrimination justified just because it's related to something optional? Here is a good analogy provided by another redditor:

Would it be discrimination if Mcdonalds conducted a study that came up with the conclusion that Latinos on average used more napkins and ketchup than other races, and therefore warranted higher prices on their meals? Eating at Mcdonalds isn't a right, it's a ""privalege"" (using the term loosely here). I don't think your argument holds water in this situation.

Another post which ultimately swayed my view back:

For one thing, maybe men drive faster because of more testosterone or other hormones. In which case, the accident difference between men and women is partially physiological.
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1212280/Men-long-ringer-fingers-likely-fast-drivers.html
Secondly, women might use more health care partially because they choose to visit the doctor more frequently.
http://consumer.healthday.com/public-health-information-30/centers-for-disease-control-news-120/women-see-doctors-more-than-men-400589.html
""Women go to the doctor more than men, about 33 percent more, and that's after we've excluded visits to medical care for pregnancy. And they are going to the doctors for things that are not acute conditions, such as preventive care or annual visits. They are twice as likely to go to the doctor for non-illness care than men,""
""The most commonly prescribed drugs were non-narcotic analgesics like Tylenol,""
And women are going to the doctor much more often for acute care, much more than men for such things as colds, the flu, the upper respiratory illnesses,""
So I think that both types of insurance use are an interaction of physiology and choice."	1403	513

And you should only have to go to school if you and your parents want you too.	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/mllwcm/cmv_compulsory_education_should_be_abolished_in/	"Let me just say I'm an actual real life teacher and not a student.

I've come to the conclusion that unless you're in a really really good place, and which I have zero experience, the average person and their parents are just not fit for school anyway. In my honest opinion, most people don't have the attention span, the drive, or The Willpower to get through some of the easiest subjects and classes that they may ever taken their entire life.

There has been a false narrative that it is the teacher's job to be engaging, and then suddenly all of these students or maybe just a majority, will start listening and paying attention and wanting to learn. Well if there's one thing being a real teacher has taught me and not just some kid at home, or some parents at home with no real experience, is that that's just not true. Most students are not going to learn on purpose, because they just don't want to.

So if you guys are confused as to the state of the education system in the United States right now let me go ahead and spell it out for you. Most kids have no clue what's going on, and quite frankly they're not learning anything. Most kids are being passed indiscriminately regardless of the fact that I could easily tell you out of all of the kids I have taught in just this one year - easily 3/4 of them are just not ready to be in the grade that there in. Not just that but they are for rent asleep behind. I am consistently getting 9th graders who don't even know what the seven continents are. I am consistently getting 9th graders who think North America is a country. I am consistently getting 9th graders who literally can't write, can't read better than maybe a second grader could read, and just don't know what the hell is going on. And you can blame the teachers all you want, but I have looked at the classes and it's just not 9 out of 10 times.

Listen, some teachers do suck. But for the most part we're doing what we need to do and if you are even a normal person, trying at the most minimal of levels, you should be able to learn adequately regardless of your learning style or any other problem that you might have. So it goes far deeper than that and I think that's the problem, regular people don't want to admit that it's them they have to blame somebody else and teachers are an easy target because everybody's been to school and everybody bitches about it, so all the parents think they're being the cool parent and relating to hating the teachers except all they're doing is causing more problems.

Let me also make it clear that most students that are currently being given IEPs, which is an individual learning plan essentially, where they have no mental illness, nothing that's holding them back, no ADHD, nothing they were just so behind because they keep shuffling them through and nobody cares if they learn anything. Because they're lazy and no teacher can get to them from the beginning. That we end up with so many students who get a free pass literally by the sped department. At my school I have been told already to just delete every bad grade that my students with IEPs have, again 80% of them have no actual reason to have an IEP, and then it inflates their grade from an F or a d to an A or a b. And they are they aren't even close to deserving that. Not even kind of close. They couldn't even tell me anything on a map. Because they genuinely know they don't have to try.

With my education, and my experience in education, I have come to the conclusion that it would probably be better for everybody if we took a generation and said listen if you don't want to go to school after let's say Middle School don't. Because guess what after a generation or so they're going to learn how important school is again and start going right? But at this rate all you're doing is making all the teachers quit and everybody depressed because guess what guys, news flash if you didn't know, teaching is not teaching anymore, it's just babysitting, the most behaviorally inept people that you will ever meet.

And it's always your fault.

But as a former smoker, current vaper, vaping is much less harmful than smoking. This applies only to nicotine vaping products that contain no oils or vitamin E (which is used in thc/cbd vape products to allow absorption of the thc/cbd which are fat soluable). 

It exposes you to much fewer of the harmful components of smoking and the effects of switching are easy to see: after a couple of weeks of only vaping, your lungs are much more clear, you can run without getting short of breath, and your blood pressure is much better. 

None of this is to say that vaping is harmless, but for many who smoke it is a much better alternative. Many who smoke will not simply quit, or they would have. This provides a stepping stone for some and a better alternative for others.

Some will refer to the USSR, China, Vietnam, and such countries as communist, others would argue that they aren't communist as they don't meet the standards.

What has become abundantly clear to me is that these two sides both see communism as a different thing.

1. Your average person who has not done any research on Marxism or communism might call it this: **""When the government controls everything, when there are gulags, when you can't own things, when everyone is absolutely equal except for the leaders who are rich""**
2. Someone who is a communist, or at least understands basic Marxism would go with the original definition of **""A stateless and monetarily classless society in which the community as a whole owns the means of production""**

As a result of this, when people critique communism, there is a good chance that what they are talking about is something that no communist would support or admit as communism.

So almost all discussions about communism can get no where as a supporter of communism may often spend most of his time just informing the other person that what they believe is communism is not actually what they support or what Marx or Engels defined.

&amp;#x200B;

And this is why there is so much confusion surrounding the topic of communism

Positive rights to assistance, say to basic goods like healthcare or education, or being rescued from harm, do not exist. I find this claim unpersuasive and never see it argued for. Moreover, I think it leads to a contradiction, so I am going to argue that there is a right to assistance by way of arguing that the contrary view is absurd. In sum:

&gt;P1. There are no rights to assistance.  
&gt;  
&gt;P2. However, there are rights not to be harmed.  
&gt;  
&gt;P3. Rights should not only be *respected*, but *protected*, for instance, by intervening when rights are violated, and by establishing social institutions and arrangements that promote and protect those rights.**\***  
&gt;  
&gt;P4. Protecting rights is a form of assistance.  
&gt;  
&gt;P5. Therefore, P1 and P3 cannot both be true.  
&gt;  
&gt;P6. Therefore, P1 leads to absurdity and is false.  
&gt;  
&gt;P7. If P1 is false, there are rights to assistance.  
&gt;  
&gt;C8. There are rights to assistance.

How far that right extends is another set of debates, for a different set of threads. At minimum, this argument establishes that there is a right to assistance when rights not to be harmed are threatened. These forms of assistance may require effort, service, and the paying of taxes. You might still think there are no rights to education or healthcare, or other goods and services, *but if so, you cannot argue for this by way of arguing that there are no rights to assistance, because my argument shows that claim to be false.*

**\*Edit: P3 is generating a lot of controversy in the replies, so here is an argument for it:**

&gt;i. Rights are entitlements.  
&gt;  
&gt;ii. When someone is deprived of an entitlement, an unjust state of affairs exists.  
&gt;  
&gt;iii. Unjust states of affairs should be prevented.  
&gt;  
&gt;iv. Preventing an unjust state of affairs is a form of protection.  
&gt;  
&gt;vi. Conclusion: there is an obligation not merely to respect but to protect rights (P3).

For example there is not first person shooter movie genre, there is no platforming movie genre. 

Video game genres are defined by their gameplay in contrast to other mediums which are defined by their style or theme. For example Mario, Limbo, Celeste and Super Meat boy are all 2d platforms but vary greatly in their style and themes and their style/themes aren't even considered genres or sub-genres of any kind (with the possible exception of Limbo but I'll get to that). This rule that genre is the gameplay holds true with one exception, horror games. 

For whatever reason horror is considered a genre despite being an aesthetic, a style or theme that has nothing to do with gameplay and it's application is entirely arbitrary, for example dark souls has a horror aesthetic equal or greater to ""horror"" games yet it itself is not labeled as such. As far as I can tell the application of the ""horror"" genre is entirely inconsistent and arbitrary and often just self-imposed by developers who seem to want to make movies instead. 

For example five nights are freedy's, Dying light, left 4 dead and FEAR are all considered to be in the horror genre yet have literally nothing in common gameplay wise. 

The use of horror as a genre in video games is entirely uncalled for and should be stopped change my mind."	0	122	0.5

I’m going to start with the Celts else I’ll be here till the pre-Celtic cows come home. 

The Romans invaded the Celts and, over time, Roman culture was merged with our own - [what have the Romans ever done for us](https://youtu.be/Qc7HmhrgTuQ)? Celtic culture didn’t “die” in this change*, in fact, the style of localised settlements lived on arguably up to the industrial era - and that was a full on invasion: if that can’t destroy culture, you’re telling me that the 200,000 immigrants to the U.K. each year will? After the Romans left there a mass migration of Angles and Saxons from Germany (hence: “Anglo-Saxon”), which again, just served to differentiate our way of life and culture even more from other groups and forge “Englishness” even more. Following this, you have the invasions of Vikings, which gave us traditions such as the days of the week (e.g today is “Thursday” or “Thor’s day”). Then the Normans (themselves descendants of Vikings) who gave us... well pretty much everything: a monarch, castles, feudalism etc. Then we gained a ton from continual wars with the french and just the casual passing of time, until the empire which - whilst also barbaric and savage to other countries - had a huge effect on English culture, such as widespread accessibility of the much beloved tea. 

All in all, it seems to me an awful lot like it is collisions *between* people that create and preserve culture, not isolationism. For another example, my favourite music is jazz which is mostly a product of African American heritage (including slavery and all that entails) being combined with the popular music in America the time. In turn, jazz was then combined with American popular music, resulting in things such as Elvis Presley’s (unfortunately often largely illegal) uses of “Black music”."	4	12	0.63

This is not to say that a Black person MUST react violently, but that, if they do, it is not completely unjustified. 

My reasoning is that, for many Black people, hearing the N-word from a non-black person (especially a white person) is something akin to psychological trauma. It does more than enrage Black people, it also brings up the old racial scars from history as well as the present. The reason violent retaliation should be decriminalized, however, is because of the nature of this specific word. It's ""nature"" is that it is a word that is so specific to and hurtful to Black people in America that there is no equivalent word, insult, phrase, or slur that a Black person could use to retaliate against it. This leaves many Black Americans in a position of frustration that is unjustified and inescapable. 

Therefore, this rule would not only provide an outlet for a Black person's frustration, but also deter non-black use of the word, two things I consider to be good things. 

As long as the incident does not lead to permanent injury or death, there would be no long term consequences to the violence. Also, because of this ""cap"" on the severity of violence, it discourages Black Americans to even use this new right, as they would risk permanent injury or a murder charge. 

I am open to critiques of this opinion, as it conflicts with many of my other beliefs. But something about it feels right. So, if you can, change my view. 

EDIT:

This is the updated version of this opinion.

The following shall be a defense to assault:

A person shall face no criminal or civil liability if they commit an assault provided the assault:

1.) Was provoked by the use of a racial epithet

2.) The defendant reasonably believed the epithet was intentionally directed at them or maliciously used.

3.) The assault does not cause lasting or serious bodily harm or death.


Edit#2:

Instead of being a formal law, I think this should be a social norm. Similar to an instance of a ""bar fight"" when two intoxicated individuals are (in many instances) given the benefit of the doubt and, instead of being arrested, are sent home. This is not always the case and, sometimes, people are arrested. Basically, the leniency for barfights should also be applied to this instance.

For these reasons, I believe we should stop calling young people pretty and instead focus on the abilities of their body and mind. This is my first post by the way, so please be kind and considerate when you respond, thanks! 

Quick intro: My name is Naomi and I'm a cisgender woman. This opinion is largely based off of experiences I have had in my life and my journey towards defining my worth (which is still underway).


When we think of beautiful women, we quite often think of thin, pale, cisgender girls who fit a very specific mold. All that the concept of beauty does is add yet another layer of challenge to being a working woman in this age. 

""Show some skin, but don't be a skank. Look wise, but don't have any wrinkles. Be flirty, but not a slut."" 

These are all things a woman might hear in her journey towards ""beauty"", or, let's call it what it really is, gender inequality. 

On TV, there might be two hosts talking through the day's news. The first is an older man - 50 or so - wearing a crisp suit with a short stubble lining his flawed face. He's called intelligent, wise, and analytical. The second is a younger woman - 30, maybe? - in a tight red dress with a cardigan over her shoulders, with blonde curls laying near her collarbone and makeup enhancing her sun damaged skin. She's called an ugly whore from whom we have nothing to learn. 

I think it also feeds into many other issues women (and people of all genders) face that have to do with body image. Eating disorders, body dysmorphia, bad body image; all these issues might be helped if we dismantle the system many people get stuck in (I'm not as well educated on this point as I am on some of the others, so if I'm wrong about this please tell me).


The current (at time of posting) reasons against this that I'm aware of are:

1. It would be very difficult to execute this idea and might harm instead of benefit.

2. Men also have body image issues so if we remove the word beauty, we must also remove the word handsome, hot, stunning or any other synonyms.

3. It seems like a dystopian concept to remove usages of a word based on one issue. If it's beauty this time, what's next?

4. It could increase obesity rates if we have no lines between plus sized confidence and encouraging unhealthy behaviour. By not focusing on the state of our bodies, we may make being overweight more common? I'm not sure about this one.


I would call myself a feminist which includes transgender women, so please do not say anything hurtful towards that group. I acknowledge that abolishing ""pretty-ness"" is a difficult task, but in my mind it makes logical sense and taking steps towards it is a good idea. I'd love to hear some arguments against my point by the way, so please respond in the comments below! I read every one."	0	38	0.43

I agree that fascism is bad and that black lives matter, and I agree that the police need reform and other policies espoused by these left wing groups, but I do not agree, specifically, with their support for and fixation on (especially specific kinds of) violence as a means to achieve these ends (especially given peaceful methods are more effective).

I believe there are four key factors that lead to the effect described in the title. 

1. Among the general populace, violent acts such as rioting, looting, assault, and so on are either generally unpopular or are polarizing, largely on party lines. 
2. Left-wingers engaging in violence (or opportunists committing violence with the blessing of left-wingers) have shown themselves to be more than willing to mutilate their conception of ""fascism"" to include anyone they don't like, including supposedly false or dishonest ""leftists"" (that's me), neoliberals, and anyone to the right of neoliberals (""libs get the bullet, too"", and the average republican is ""close enough"" to fascism, they have said). Thus, it is plausible that a majority of the population could be considered a legitimate target for ""antifascist"" action.
3. Those victimized or otherwise clashing with these groups will, at best, have no change of opinion and will, more likely, become more aligned against left-wing groups or ideas (exacerbated by the second factor)
4. The above, in addition to internal and external hostility in left-wing communities make them difficult to enter and remain within, leaving individuals vulnerable to radicalization without a viable left-wing alternative to the right-wing pipeline. This factor could be understood to refer to the ""violence"" of doxxing, harassment, purity testing, and other malicious behaviors common to left-wing communities.

The combined effect of the above factors creates a situation in which moderates are turned off from left-wing ideas, victims of ""antifascist"" action are radicalized against left-wing ideas, and many who would still seek to join left-wing communities despite this are turned away.

Admittedly, this post is predominantly informed by my personal experience. In a way, I am asking for reasons to keep trying to associate with the left side of the aisle.

What will change my mind (at least partially):

* demonstration that violence against an individual for their beliefs aligns them closer to the aggressor's ideology
* demonstration that the left-wing pipeline is developed and inclusive (of moderates, converts, and the ""ideologically impure"") enough to rival the right-wing pipeline
* demonstration that groups like antifa and BLM become more popular among non-leftists after supporting violence
* demonstrating that the kinds of violence these groups support in the context that the violence has occurred is legitimately an imperative and effective response to an immediate and dire situation. This can be understood to be equivalent to a self-defense justification i.e. ""if I do not loot this random man's store I will die"".

What will not change my mind:

* making any argument that appeals to the size or organizational structure (or the lack, thereof) of antifa or BLM. I am already aware that these groups are relatively small and disorganized. Neither of these factors are pertinent.
* calling me a fascist or otherwise right-wing. This would serve only to confirm my view.
* insisting that right-wing groups support violence, too. This is not pertinent, and I would argue that right-wing violence isn't likely to win anyone over, except in cases where the violence is an ""imperative and effective response to an immediate and dire situation"", a la Kyle Rittenhouse."	0	83	0.47

I just feel like no matter what event people give me, I can point to it and say that the wealthy aren't going to have miserable lives because they can just move to different locations, they can throw money at anything to make it better, etc. 

To CMV, prove that there is an event that is reasonably likely to happen that will cause the wealthy to have miserable lives. If climate change is the worst event that people can give me and I easily refuted it, then are there really any events left?

EDIT: I have changed my view. The main argument that changed my view was in regards to economics, I guess if there is an economic downturn then that could hurt the wealthy since they're already more susceptible to depression. It must be terrible to live in a mansion and then have to downsize to a small house. I also read that some people killed themselves during the great recession. I guess I overlooked the fact that the economy is connected in many different ways and New York or London being under water could eventually have an impact on the amount of money that the wealthy get.

Some games to set as an example:

Monkey Island

Grim Fandango

Kathy Rain

Deponia

Downfall/Cat Lady/Lorelai

Nancy Drew series

Dropsy

Day of The Tentacle

Unavowed

Beneath a Steel Sky

Thimbleweed Park

Etc.


I don't mean to gatekeep what a game is but when I think of a game I usually think of something with replay value (Skyrim, Fallout, FTL, Binding of Isaac, Valheim, Dead Cells, TF2, Dishonored), and if not replay value at least something you can play for a long time (mainly general examples of long-ish play time, not a lack of replayability: Dark Souls, Red Dead Redemption 1 / 2, Hollow Knight, Dead Island, Far Cry series, Stardew Valley)


When it comes to game length it always seems like adventure games are such short experiences that it almost feels prohibitive for the cost. I'm sure there are experiences you could have with really short games that make it worth paying the price of much larger and fully fleshed out games, but at the same time I feel like there is somewhere a line is drawn between the amount of potency certain experiences can have and the fiscal practicality of that experience. Even when it comes down to it why play a point and click when you can play a short but (likely) much more interesting first person game which doesn't confine you to specific screens that likely affords you much more freedom to solve problems or do things (Example: Outer Wilds). Point and click adventure games just feel claustrophobic and like the antithesis of adventure.


Lastly, it feels like most, if not all, point and click adventure games are just digital pop up books and should have just been turned into actual books instead of interactive images and audio clips. If this was the route they went I feel like they would be much more in their element and interesting. When I think of point and click adventure games I think of something a really young kid plays in the school/library computer lab or similar setting to distract themselves with the main replayability value being based in the fact they don't have anything else to play or they like speedrunning through it.


I am really sorry if I come off poorly or as a gatekeeper in stating my opinions, but this has always been a thought in the back of my mind for some reason and I've always had an aversion towards these kinds of games even though they have their communities that stand by them. I don't know what they get out of these games or what I'm potentially missing that is supposed to make them more appealing than I am ascribing to it. If any clarification is needed or I did not articulate myself well enough any questions are appreciated."	0	37	0.38

Lately I’ve been seeing articles with titles like “Why White People Don’t Understand the N-word” etc. 

Of the people I know who are African American, they’ve put a double standard on the word that from my point of view, seems to perpetuate racism from their own side. Not all African Americans do this, but because of the African Americans who do draw that hard line saying, “we can joke with that word and what not, but white people can’t,” it seems like they’re breeding racism in their own way. They keep racism alive by turning it into an “us” (African Americans) versus “them” (Whites). If we’re really trying to come together as communities, shouldn’t all words have the same context within our agreed language of English regardless of the gender/race speaking the word? I understand It’s all about “context”, but I don’t think physical attributes like skin color qualifies alone as context - especially if the white person is trying to be friendly just as they are. Additionally, it’s thrown in lots of media that white people do watch, so we associate that word now as a positive thing meaning friend. The white people who say it trying to imitate the models they admire who are African Americans like Kendrick Lamar, Dr. Dre or whoever else it might be, are scoffed at and gotten-on-to purely because of the race saying the word... isn’t that in itself racism? Are African Americans not being racist by purposefully taking things out of context and putting it into a context of their choice because of someone’s skin color? 

So my question is, aren’t African Americans perpetuating racism on their end by “their” culture not allowing other cultures to use “their” word when it should be “our” culture as Americans. Meaning, it should either be everyone’s word or no one’s word - the double standard, from my current point of view, incites racism, a one-sided “us” and “them” mentality.





—&gt;P.S. If your argument is all historically based with slaves, then please come up with something additionally different. Everyone’s heard that defense a million times and it’s literally over 200 years old. I’ll take a shot in the dark, but I think most African Americans today were not enslaved personally soooo... Have a more creative and thought out response more relevant to the daily lifestyle of African Americans today. ALSO, no need to be crass against anyone, I promise I’m just trying to understand. I’m very fair and what I believe is okay for one gender/race should be okay for all gender/races... I’m rambling now "	0	49

I'm a gay guy in my 30s. I understand there are plenty of people that feel certain in their sexuality from a young age, I'm not one of them. I feel that being gay was very much a choice for me. So with that said...

The view that I'm presenting, one which is pretty unpopular (hence my wanting it challenged), is this:

It's  very common for folks in the gay community (and, indeed, the wider community) to hold rigidly the view that homosexuality is something one is born with. I believe this view

* Undermines the position of people that feel their sexuality was a choice for them;
* Perpetuates the notion that, if being gay were a choice, it would be an invalid one;
* Provokes tribalist behaviour by splitting the gay community into ""real"" and ""fake"" groups
* Denies the effect of cultural, sociological and economic factors in reinforcing sexuality archetypes
* Is reductive, in that it
   * Fails to acknowledge the complexity and diversity of the human condition;
   * Denies the fluidity of sexual attraction and desire over time;
   * Denies the notion that sexuality can exist on a spectrum.
* Does not (currently) seem to be supported by genetics research ([https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6456/eaat7693](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6456/eaat7693)).

I  understand that I am coming from a position of privilege; I've not really experienced any persecution on the basis of my sexuality, for which I'm very grateful.

But it seems enough to me that people can live how they want to live and love who they want to love. It feels hopelessly old-fashioned to have to justify it though whatever means.

Thanks for reading, I'm very keen to hear your thoughts on this. :)

*Edit: Thanks for those that have replied so far, I appreciate your input. I just wanted to clarify; by claiming that I feel my sexuality was a choice (whether I'm 'right' or 'wrong' in feeling this), I'm not at all suggesting that sexuality as a whole is a choice for everyone. My view, encapsulated in the title and detailed in the post, is this:* ***To suggest that sexuality is*** ***universally*** ***genetic or biological is*** ***reductive*** ***and old fashioned***. *I've listed in my post why I feel this, in as rational a way as I'm able. A lot of folks are attempting to Change My View of my own sexuality, which is not what I'm requesting. If you want to engage, I would ask, please, that you address the dot points in my post; that's the meat of my argument. If it helps, just ignore my comment about choice, it wasn't intended to be divisive, only descriptive of my own experience to give some context.*"	26	113	0.65

That's six *separate* lineages all settling on armored shells, molting, regeneration, pincers, etc.

You could say that crabs are like living tanks, except tanks have guns. If crabs were ever to obtain a biological ranged feature, they would be poised to become the ultimate life form. Consider a crab that could forcibly eject something akin to a stingray stinger. Or many smaller spines. Or perhaps an ink spray / vemon spray.  


Normally, crabs are defeated in three ways:  


1) A specialized predator obtains a hold on the crab and defeats it's armor. Such as a starfish or snail. A ranged defense can engage these foes before they get close enough to hold on.  


2) A large predator such as a ray or shark just bodies the crab and eats it. Large predators are easy to hit. Engaging the predator before it gets it eating distance would really help.   


3) A small mobile predator out maneuvers the crab. Similar to the large predator, a ranged defense at least gives an ability to threaten the maneuverable predator.

&amp;#x200B;

There would need to be corresponding improvements to eyesight and such to support development of ranged abilities. Just to nip the easiest counterpoint in the bud."	1053	170	0.93

Now what I mean is look at the food it’s sprayed with many pesticides like glyphosate that are harmful to humans. Or water for example in every plastic water bottle it has BPA or Biphensol-A which is a chemical known to lower men’s testosterone. And those are just a few examples. Now these corporations get away with doing this because many food regulation company’s or systems like the FDA have been bought out by these corporations.

College is ""brainwashing"" for corporate positions (or those that pay well). It is a scam to funnel people for companies, not help people actually learn or achieve what they desire. 

On a personal note, I will never graduate with a degree because all the work involved is this standard cookie cutter model. It promotes apathy and regression. It is the heart of evil when people cannot think rationally due to constricted time limitations.

Before college, I had so many ideas and things I wanted to try. But then I was branded. I was ""this degree"" or ""that degree."" I was not a person with choices, instead I needed to make careful choices for a new ""future"" of economic opportunity within ""faceless large company."" This meant removing my values and desires, and submitting to a higher paying power to cope with any insecurities.

I only have two classes left in my degree, but at this point, I do not see myself returning to the college environment.

I ask you, change my view and belief on college. How can college help atypical workers? Because to me, and as it stands, my view is that college is corporate funneling infrastructure. It helps promote a standard working culture instead of gaining skills. Everyone is used to pad a resume and critical thinking is more of an after-thought.

Please change my view, thank you.

Corporations have often ignored the law, and even when they are caught, face smaller fines than the profits made from breaking the law.

And very rarely has a CEO, CFO or COO done jail time when ""the corporation"" has broken the law. Bernie Madoff is the only example I can think of...

CMV	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1h79ua/i_believe_the_united_states_should_split_up_into/	"I'm an American and for the longest time solidly believed in not only the conservation of the union, but the addition to it (granting statehood to territories). However, the last eight years have shown me how ineffective a large bureaucracy is and the detriment it causes to the individual states.

Let me clarify my stance by reaffirming that I do believe in a strong federal government. I also believe that the federal gov't needs to be fair in its dealings with the states and as the country grows, its becoming increasingly difficult for that to happen.

I think that by allowing states to form more local unions (New England, Mid-Atlantic, the South, The Rust Belt, The Sun Belt, Texas, California, The Pac-NW, The Rockies, The Great Plains) and to give those unions complete federal powers, it would be more beneficial to the states.

The de-localization of our government as led to increasing dissent between the states and the federal government over policy and procedure, and that is unhealthy in a union such as the US.

To me this seems to solve the great divide. It reaffirms the federal goverments position and necessity, while giving the states their power back. There could even be a super-union of these unions if they deem necessary (national defense comes to mind, we exist in NATO and the UN without handing over sovereignty, why can't it work this way with the states).

So, please, I invite you to change my view on this. Convince me the union is worth saving."	11	25

However, there isn't a drop of historical evidence to suggest this is even remotely the case. In fact, history seems to suggest just the *opposite*: the founders were terrified of the outcome of a popular insurrection, and wrote quite a bit about what could be expected if regular folks were successful (primarily, the landed gentry feared that they would strip them of their land and wealth, redistributing it more equitably; Federalist 6 goes into quite a bit of detail on this). 

The Second Amendment explicitly ties the right to bear arms to the protection of the State, and nothing else: not freedom, not democracy, not our inalienable rights, not a reestablishment of what we think the Bill of Rights should be about. It was designed, unambiguously, **for the protection of the State**. 

The Founding Fathers had no problem killing citizens when they rebelled against the State in the name of freedom or greater enfranchisement, and this is especially obvious to anyone who pays attention to the order of events in American history. The Founding Father's put down a revolution just a year before the Constitution was ratified, during which time both Samuel Adams and George Washington expressed the belief that anyone who rebelled against the State should be executed. Couple this with a rather dim view of the wider populace held by the elite at the time, one is left to wonder who was supposed to be leading the future revolt. Clearly, the gentry didn't trust the common people enough to do it, and at the same time, they were doing everything they could to further entrench their power-- so why undermine a system that at the very least guarantees them a comfortable position?

The answer is they never intended for the Second Amendment to be used as many people interpret it today.

My understanding is that prisons are designed to reform individuals so that when they come out of prisons they can become functional members of society. By locking people away forever (without the chance of ever coming out) what's the point of keeping them alive? It's not like they're ever going to rejoin society anyways so it doesn't make any sense to keep them imprisoned until they die.

So whats the point of keeping people alive if they're never going to come out of prison? Obviously there's the possibility that they could've been falsely accused, but how large is that group anyways? It seems to me that keeping people in prison forever makes no sense.

My argument is that this state of affairs is not as negative as many of the accounts I have heard of it would imply. 

The premise is inherently subjective--please stop me here if people on the whole are in fact celebrating or at least not bemoaning the fact that we live in a ""post-truth"" world. Additionally, the premise is also incorrect if we do not in fact live in a world characterized as above. 

In support of my argument, I posit that information in a ""pre-truth"" world is worse than the current state of affairs. This is because a given conclusion, fact, or other statement would be produced by a strongly centralized process--a singular trusted source. These processes are fallible, and produce information linearly: essentially, information takes one path at a time. By way of example, I think of how structures in power in the US set back the study of psychedelic substances for decades. Due to their classification as scheduled substances, laboratories found it very difficult to obtain samples, and clinical trials were out of the question. However, it is now coming to light that many of these drugs can in fact be used to great benefit. Work is still ongoing, but we are learning much that can augment quality of life or reduce suffering. The decision to withhold further investigation thus caused great harm in retrospect. There are, I'm sure, a plethora of other examples but they all follow the general form: a conclusion wrongly made by the powers that be and thus never subject to further discussion and investigation was not corrected until the powers that be were no longer. 

I anticipate an argument against this view being that without centralized stamps of approval for the ""truthiness"" of a claim, we have no reason to believe something that may be objective fact, especially if it runs counter to our beliefs, values, or incentives. A climate change denier, for example, may say simply ""well I remain convinced that global warming is a sham, no matter who says what, and will this continue to live my life according to this idea."" Or one can simply look at anti-vaxxers or anti-maskers for examples of where taking the truth into one's own hands does great harm to populations at large (perhaps I'm begging the question with all these examples so far depending on the audience, please bear with me). Democratization of information does not necessarily lead to a reduction in harm or suffering. 

However, I argue that on the whole, it indeed will reduce harm or at least lead over time to a greater understanding of objective reality. It will, however, look like greater discord and unrest as more people are involved in the conversation. I don't have historical examples here, as the ""post-truthiness"" of the conversation is to my limited knowledge unprecedented. But I do have simply hope and faith in humanity, as well as smaller-scale examples like science as an institution, that speak positively of the overall loss of ""truthiness"" to any given statement."	0	40	0.29

In laboratory experiments we manipulate the behavior of animals by presenting them with specific stimuli. And yet, when we are manipulated by stimuli in our environment, our minds present this to us as a choice we are making. According to a well-known study which measured human brain activity, ""The recordable cerebral activity (readiness-potential, RP) that precedes a freely voluntary, fully endogenous motor act was directly compared with the reportable time (W) for appearance of the subjective experience of 'wanting' or intending to act. The onset of cerebral activity clearly preceded by at least several hundred milliseconds the reported time of conscious intention to act."" [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6640273/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6640273/)

In this Universe, there are events which are fully predictable if you have enough data (such as where Mars will be next Tuesday) and events which seem to unfold according to probability (such as how subatomic particles behave). I think we perceive humans as having free will because we don't have enough data to fully predict their behavior, and because human behavior also can be influenced by probabilistic events, severely complicating the calculation. In my opinion, it is highly likely that human behavior is a mixture of predictable causality and random chance, and that none of our actions are due to what we call free will.

To change my view, you would have to demonstrate that people are capable of taking actions which are not the result of either a chain of causality stretching back to the big bang, random chance, or a mixture of the two."	1	90	1.0

The temperatures have been wrong (too hot/too cold), the air pressure has been wrong, the atmosphere has had too many toxins in it, and natural disasters (volcanoes, meteors, earth quakes, tsunamis, etc.) have been wiping out species trying to survive since beginning of time.
   * Humans are among the 1% of survivors who got ""lucky"" and survived, which doesn't even mean anything considering that a volcano can erupt at any time and wipe everyone out unexpectedly. We are really only here for a short amount of time.
* Galaxies: there have been millions of galaxies in the universe and most have failed; stars collapsed, solar systems failed, etc. It seems as if the ""formation of a successful planet &amp; life"" is like winning the lottery. Even if it happens, it soon fails or gets wiped out.
* Human societies: endless wars, famine, starvation, political disagreements; marriages are failing at over 50% rates; relationships are collapsing left and right..  It feels like love is futile, friendships are disappointing, death is inevitable. Economies are collapsing (due to lack of agreement between people).

As far as relationships in my life; half of my relatives are already dead (I am only 27 years old). Every romantic relationship I've had in life failed. Most relationships I've seen around me have failed. If I have a successful relationship, it only lasted a short amount of time. This seems similar to life on earth as a whole - species may live for a short amount of time but will eventually go extinct for some reason or another.

So on a global scale - what is the point of this? nothing here will ever even matter."	16	48	0.7

If your kid is like 14 or 15, at that age where they are beginning to form their views and opinions, and it happens that they see the world different than you and have political views that are 180 degrees different and would vote in a different way than you, how would this make you feel as a parent, and would you feel like you had a responsibility to change their minds?

In my view, if they are 14-18, this is when they are developing critical thinking, and they should be starting to understand the world and socioeconomic ideas at least on a basic level

IF by using critical thinking and their own way of logic and reasoning and they end up with a different view, I think that is ok. 

I think its quite damaging to tell ur kid, especially when they are 14-18 which is a volatile time ""your subjective view is wrong because it doesnt match mine"", you are eliminating their ability to think for themselves and making them dependent on you. instead of making their own decisions later in life, their default will be ""what would mom and dad do""?

I just feel that him trying to promote anti-domestic violence actually weakens any awareness on the topic. It feels like the underlying message is: Don't beat up a woman because it will ruin your life. That shouldn't be the message. It should be: DON'T EVER DO IT BECAUSE VIOLENCE IS WRONG, PERIOD.

Consumption of products and services is long-lasting. Maturation is slow and somewhat enjoyable.

But, when we think we can achieve anything, we put in the required effort to reach that new height, we learn to study more effectively and efficiently. We become capable of achievement in a much shorter space of time. Progress is steep at first, but soon we reach our full potential, and things flatten out. We soon get bored of consuming the same products, maturation is quick and we peak early. 

So my argument is that thinking ""we can't do anything"" is BETTER for individuals and a society as a whole. If we get too smart too quick we fail to see obstacles and our motivation to overcome adversity dissipates because there is NO adversity. And the lack of resistance is completely unmotivating. When everything is easy, no work is compelling or fulfilling because it does not challenge us.

These are individuals that will never speak or truly comprehend anything. They can't use the bathroom by themselves and often can't walk. Often, it takes 2 individuals just to make sure they are looked after. 

The immense amount of resources one of these individuals takes is outstanding, especially since they will never contribute to society. 

In the same way that I think that abortion is moral from a utilitarian point of view, I think that euthanasia of these individuals is also utilitarian. 

A common argument for individuals of prochoice is that ""If you're a poor woman and you get pregnant, you likely can't afford a child. If you're a young woman and you get pregnant, you likely can't afford them either, even if your lifestyle is middle or even upper-middle class. Carrying that baby to term has the potential to ruin your life. Maybe you were a college student, on track to being the next Nobel prize winner, and then you got pregnant..."" [taken from a CMV a few days ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1lo7ib/i_believe_abortion_is_evil_cmv/cc19989).

The same can be said for parents of children who are severely handicapped.

Now, I'm not saying it's good (e.g. moral) to do this. In a perfect world, we'd have the resources/infrastructure for all parents/society to deal with it. But unfortunately, we don't.

Secondly, I know some people might argue for a slippery slope. First, the slippery slope is by definition a fallacy, but secondly, just because a line is hard to draw, doesn't mean it shouldn't be. In fact, I could define severely handicapped as an individual who would never be able to communicate/comprehend past a normal 2-year old level. 

Edit:  the comments seem to be arguing it from a legal perspective. I'm arguing a moral perspective.  In other words, I'm saying it's overall moral to allow for the killing of severly handicapped individuals.

These traditional models are definitely not infallible or above critique/reform. Importantly, however, they did nurture virtues of self-sacrifice and self-abasement to causes and communities that are greater than oneself. This has largely been supplanted by an unhealthy culture of excessive self-examination in the pursuit of happiness.

Our social malcontent, which is itself the product of our institutionalized hyper-consumerism and over concern with the self, compels us to seek help from an industry that further encourages us to achieve self-actualization by looking inward. What most of us really should be doing is looking outward: finding meaning in each other, living for one another, and committing ourselves to higher ideals as we commonly did in pre-industrial society. The scale to which modern Westerners rely on psychoanalysis, medication, and self-help to teach us how to be happy and satisfied with our lives really fails to put the onus on the system-wide failures that pervade our society. In this way we've tacitly accepted that our discontent, our distress, and our anxieties are individual burdens, personal failures that require personalized solutions. It feels really predatory and IMO creates a feedback loop that deepens our cultural narcissism.

For clarification, I don't think mental health is pseudoscience, nor do I think psychoanalysis, psychiatric meds, CBT, or DBT are useless. I've experienced the system as a patient, and after some reading and reflection the above is what currently makes most sense to me. I'm very open to having my mind changed and learning what everyone else has to say about this!"	12	9	0.81

Pigs and chickens are very smart, and have a certain amount of emotional intelligence. Here's part of an article from Mercy for Animals:

""From anticipating future events to recalling the trajectory of a hidden object, chickens are incredibly smart. They even possess self-control, holding out for a better food reward, and can assess their own position in the pecking order—both characteristics of self-awareness.""

All of our nations fought bloody wars against European imperialists to establish the common ideals of liberty, equality, and democracy. The war cries of the brave Americans who sacrificed their lives to end British tyranny were echoed by the brave American Libertadores who fought against Spanish tyranny in the May Revolution. The blood spilled by those who established the Empire of Brazil is the same as blood spilled by those revolutionaries who fought for Simon Bolivar. The common threads of our various histories bind us together as one.

Of course we also share in more unsavory aspects of our common history. There is no American nation that is entirely free from the sins of Slavery and Indigenous maltreatment. However, I believe it would best if we corrected these injustices together, in a united effort, rather than try to solve them individually. Even this dark stain in our collective histories binds us together.

**Values**: Our values are the same, thus there is no reason for us not to unite. We all sacrificed our lives and economy in the name of freedom, for to us there is no price you can put on freedom. In the words of Benjamin Franklin, ""Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety."" These same words were echoed by Simon Bolivar when he proclaimed, ""Fellow citizens! I blush to say this: Independence is the only benefit we have acquired, to the detriment of all the rest.""  Our values are also unique to us, no other group of nations adheres so closely to the ideals of freedom of religion, or speech, and to liberty from government as our people do. Even in Europe, for instance, they violate these basic freedoms via draconian bans on religious clothing and free speech, representing fundamental differences in the values of Europeans and Americans.

**Geography**: Flanked by the Pacific and Atlantic, our free people sit on a lonely island, isolated from the rest of the world. We have no neighbors to aid us, nor enemies that surround us, we only have each other. It is only natural that this island form a consolidated identity and an independent republic, free from external influence.

**Other arguments**: Other reasons for union include: a greater ability to defend ourselves from a common threat via a strong united army, economic benefits associated with free trade, greater leverage as a common market, and it would prevent hostilities from erupting between our states, particularly if such actions should serve to benefit some foreign power (eg. [Germany played Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Border_War_(1910%E2%80%931919)) against the US via the border war). it could also prevent some populist demagogue from taking over the whole nation, as they would have an easier time convincing a small group of people to elect them, than a large group of people with varied interests.

I know many will argue that we cannot be united due to different languages. To those I ask, did Simon Bolivar not speak Spanish as his colonial overlords did? Did Dom Pedro I not speak the same language as his Portuguese oppressors? Did Washington wage war against Britain over a difference in language?

Our nations were not formed on the basis of language, for if this were the case, our nations would not have sought independence from the European powers that ruled us. We are not defined by language, but rather a common set of values and ideals. The language of an American is not Spanish, Portuguese, or English, but rather freedom and equality.

I also understand that Union at the current moment is unfeasible, as the economic conditions of our nations are too diverse. Ultimately union must occur in a gradual fashion.

Also some may wonder why I didn't include Canada, this is because the basis of their nation is loyalty to Europe. They did not fight to liberate themselves from colonial oppression."	0	21	0.36

Our teacher has explicitly stated that in order for a source to be valid, it must come from a professional critic or an individual of recognized academic prestige.

I agree with this insofar as that a fact-based opinion is less likely to be misinformed if it is given by someone knowledgeable in the subject.

However, when it comes to interpretations of the text and other matters of speculation, I think it is silly to disregard an opinion on the basis that it does not come from an academic source.

I've been rolling around ideas like those put forth by Shadi Hamid in *Islamic Exceptionalism* (surprise!) and I've been convinced by him.

I'm going to focus on comparisons to Christianity not only cause that's what I'm most familiar with but because it is one of the religions Islam has always had a lot of contact  with.

The basic point is that Westerners continually appeal to some shared nature with Christianity and Judaism and therefore claim that Muslims will also follow the road that they eventually did in reform but *Islam*-and I'm specifically talking about the doctrines here- is a different faith from those religions. We don't necessarily need to attack the geopolitical claims (cause I tend to find that people often conflate claims about doctrines with ""Muslims"" or ""Muslim countries"") but we should note those differences and what that can lead to. 

The obvious one is the cliche about founding figures. Jesus was simply not in a position -or was  unwilling- to craft the sort of state or body of laws and behavior Mohammed did (note: This doesn't mean that ecclesiastical law or law for Christians never came about). In fact, a lot of Jesus' project has been argued to be apocalyptic, which is, in a way, a retreat from trying to fix the world all today. Mohammed was luckier in this regard. He was a legitimate state-builder and therefore did set up codes of law and behavior. Unfortunately (from my perspective) these were made holy and therefore have a tendency to transcend their time, which creates tension with secularism.

But their morality was different too (and it's tied to the above). Mohammed's use of scripture ossified certain ideas like the acceptance of beating women or sex slavery or righteous warfare against infidels. Jesus didn't. Jesus spent far less time on Earthly war (in his first lifetime anyway) and any mention of iffy sexual relations (like the stories about Mohammed and Aisha and her alarmingly young consummation, or taking the wife of his adopted son) is pretty thin in the canonical texts. 

Another one is the nature of the texts. The Qur'an is a far more unified document than Christianity's (or even Judaism's) and the claims about it are at a minimum as strong as the strongest claims about Christianity but perhaps even stronger. There is almost no controversy on the following fact: the Qur'an is the *speech* of God, in total. In Christianity the New Testament is the witness of the deeds of the Son of God filtered through various men. It may be inspired and may be inerrant (in that it doesn't mislead) but it is not, mostly, all the direct speech of God handed down by the deity itself. 

The Hadith is generally looser BUT they are accepted as sources. Quranists are basically heretics and in the extreme minority, similar to non-trinitarian Christians. The Qur'an itself exhorts people to follow Mohammed's example so while individual Hadith about his troublesome behavior can be put aside the way a lot of apologists blithely brush off the Hadith collectively is...not well representative. 

Point being, when you collect all these facts, even if you believe that a lot of the context helps make sense of Mohammed's actions historically the corpus of Islam is different and creates its own different set of pressures and problems, especially for reform. There is a naive idea amongst Christians that all religions, or at least all Abrahamic religions, are the same but Islam is exceptional. It ossifies the behavior of Mohammed and theological ideas about law that are difficult to push out."	7	55

Forget all his weird off screen, self-induced BS. The guy is a fantastic actor and has played some of the most memorable roles in some of the most memorable films of my life. His weird off screen life shouldn't overshadow his excellent acting accomplishments/abilities. Tear me up peeps! I'm usually wrong about pretty much everything.

From Color of Money, MI1, Minority Report, Top Gun, Magnolia, A Few Good Men, Jerry McGuire, Interview with the Vampire, Vanilla Sky, Valkyrie, Edge of Tomorrow, Oblivion, Rain Man, etc, there's gotta be a winner in there.

I understand that he's had several flops, but those flops, IMO, should not be considered. Each role should be judged individually based on its merit alone. Yes, several of his roles have been extremely cringe-worthy.

Maybe his timing has been horrible and another actor outdid him in each top performance. Several variable I may not be seeing from my personal perspective.

Some hold the strong view that violence is the only answer against the alt-right, and disagreeing is shaming the WWII veterans. But violence isn't the answer. Yes, American troops fought and died over the skies of Europe, in the hills of Italy, in the waters of the Atlantic, the beaches of Normandy and the fields of Europe to fight the Nazis, and they did so on American soil to fight the Confederates, but we live in modern times. That was war, and we are not at war. 

Violence only begets violence, and as despicable, horrid, and disgusting the Alt-Right is, we should not **greet** them with violence and open hostilities. If we do, then we are no better than these racists and bigots. It will only serve to legitimize their actions, and give the Left a bad image in the eyes of the moderate public. We would be seen as monsters; violent hate-filled people who are no better than the Nazis. The public's reaction to the tragic death of Heather Heyer shows that when they use violence on us, they lose support. Our cause is stronger. How would it look if the headlines said that an Alt-right supporter at Charlottesville was killed instead?
We would be seen as the violent crowd, killing those who disagreed with us. The cause of the Alt-Right would grow stronger, because as horrible as their views are, they didn't kill someone at a protest. Take a look at the Civil Rights movement in the 50s and 60s. Malcolm X promoted violent resistance, but who do we remember more fondly, Malcolm X, or MLK Jr.? Violent attacks only weaken our cause. Look at the Birmingham campaign in 1963. Violence against the protesters only served to strengthen the Civil Rights Movement, added on by the non-violence of the protesters gave them the support of the public.

However, I'm not saying that we should completely refrain from violence. Violence is only acceptable as self-defense. While I did say that violence begets violence, people also have the right to defend themselves. If a Neo-Nazi were injured after attacking counter-protesters, then the blame falls on the Neo-Nazi. The counter-protesters were merely defending themselves. If a Neo-Nazi was killed after attacking a counter-protester who was acting in self-defense, then the fault falls not on the person who defended themselves, but the instigator of the attack (although I am aware the the media and opposition can and would most likely twist it). However, if that same counter-protester goes on to attack another Neo-Nazi, then it is the counter-protester who are in the wrong.

To summarize: violence should, at all cost, be avoided. Protests and counter-protests should remain defensive and peaceful, no matter how horrid the other side's views are. Tragedies like Heyer's death only serve to strengthen our cause and weaken theirs, but if a situation calls for violence in self-defense, then so be it. As long as it is purely in self-defense, then violence is permitted. So long as the attacker persists, violence in retaliation is fair game until the attacker ceases.

Edit: **Time period I am referring to is from 1954 onwards to the modern day, in stable strong powers such as the UK, US, Canada, Korea, Germany, Sweden, etc.**

My hope this election is that the third party turn out will be significant enough to show that it is possible for them to have a legitimate following, contrary to it only being the typical two parties dueling it out. If I did not live in Florida, my vote would be clear because most other states have voted the same party the last 100 years.

I am a guy who has never really had dating or sexual success. I’m 22 and a virgin and I’ve pretty much given up completely on dating. I’m really only able to talk about this from the male perspective. This is not at all an attempt to shit on women for not wanting to date me.

So dating advice in general is very difficult to give. This is because dating is mostly based on luck. Mainly just being born lucky with good genetics. I think that in dating being physically attractive is a huge level of power a person can hold. It’s better than being funny, or having a good personality because it can replace that. After all Unfortunately for us ugly folks, being physically attractive makes you appear more [funny](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886912005028), more [intelligent, and like you have a better personality.](https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/0033-2909.110.1.109).

So I know what people will say, Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but in many aspects the overwhelming majority of society agree something’s are more attractive than others. I mean there’s a reason why Michael B. Jordan is seen as a sex symbol and objectively attractive man compared to someone like Steve Buscemi. Some things are objective and most of those things aren’t controllable. Height, skin color, hair (balding or not), athleticism etc.

This means that the people who do hit those qualifiers for physically attractive will then be seen as much smarter and funnier than less attractive men whether it’s true or not. These men will disregard their looks when giving dating advice and give advice on what they think worked for them when in reality it was their looks.

I think women tend to do something similar but in reverse. When women give dating advice to men, they are giving advice that they wish the one specific guy they have their eyes set on would do, not what they think men should do to be successful with women. So they give advice that ends up being unhelpful.

Or something I’ve experienced is that my female acquaintances tell me to do things that work for women but not for men. Ex: “just go to the bar and wait for a woman to come speak to you” which is very nice of her to offer some advice but clearly that not advice that would work for men who aren’t like 10/10 6’4 Henry Cavill mfers.

I also think there’s an inability to relate. Something I’ve notice here on Reddit is when I say, “I’ve never had a girl like me” and the response is that I’ve definitely had a girl like me but never noticed. I think this comes simply from a place of ignorance. Of course normal and attractive guys have that one story of some girl liking them and them not realizing it until years later. Ugly guys don’t really have that as we tend to be more socially isolated. Simply put women do not talk to us and typically never have. I don’t have any close female friends. Just women I know because of my male friends.

It’s just impossible to give advice that’s meaningful. I know people try and I appreciate the effort but due to the nature of the way ugly people exist, we’re just not really able to be helped. For me, because I’m truly ugly and not an average guy that has “low self esteem” I think the option that’s best for me is to give up. If it’s never going to happen why put in the effort to continue to depress myself."	24	296	0.66

CMV	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ue5ji/if_you_were_to_oppose_gay_rights_which_i_do_not/	"Although I do not oppose gay rights, include marriage equality, I can see why those who do do so. They think homosexuality is a deviant behavior that either should not be allowed or at worst not be normalized by the public at large. However, where these groups like the National Organization for Marriage stumble is that they use incorrect analogies that hurt their agenda.

Beastiality is improper because it involves a practice which one party cannot consent and is considered extremely deviant behavior. Polygamy is improper because it only concerns the issue of marriage equality, not the broader gay rights acceptance movement and almost no one in modern Western society practices it openly.

Nudism, while not perfect, is a better analogy because it involves a practice that while rare is not unheard of and many people can envision themselves being one of them if only because they do it every time they undress.

Most people are very uncomfortable around others who were nude if they were not.  Therefore, nudism today is largely confined to secluded beaches and camps. For those who practice nudism the topic itself is very hard to discuss with those who don't do it this leads to parent telling their children to kept quiet with other kids, even their friends.

While many nudists aren't looking for society to celebrate their lifestyle, they want nudism to be less stigmatized and verboten among the public. This is what gays wanted at the beginning of the gay rights movement and it expanded from there.

Therefore, acceptance of nudism is a more appropriate analogy to gay rights."	4	16

Thus, the parenthesis sign is the critical element of the ASCII emotion, as it is the indicator of emotion.  Almost all languages use the left-to-right writing convention, so it is logical for the parenthesis to come first, as it is the most critical component.  

Also, a fallacious smiley face could be syntactically confusing if placed at the end of a sentence because it fuses with whatever punctuation that the sentence contains.:)  The superior orientation does not share this downside.(:

Most humans are right handed, so they would naturally tilt their heads to the right.  If looking at a mirror image of oneself and tilting their head to the right, the smiley would naturally be oriented in the (: fashion.  I know that some of you will invariably argue for the photographic version instead of the mirror image version, but most people look at themselves in the mirror more often than in photos.

On the keyboard itself, it is much more natural to go from a higher key to a lower key rather than the other way around.  So it is actually more convenient to type (: as well.

CMV	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1rjhxc/i_believe_that_bitcoin_will_be_a_spectacular/	"With BitCoin's value growing rapidly, it has garnered a lot of attention in the media. This attention has sparked interest, causing more people to buy into BitCoin. Consequently, its value continues to rise at a rapid rate.

I do not own any BitCoins, but if I did, I would never buy anything with it. Why would I use BitCoins to purchase something, knowing that the value of my BitCoins will probably rise in a week? Consequently, BitCoin gets used for speculation more than actual use as a currency. 

The second a BitCoin's value begins to dip, you're gonna have a bunch of people scrambling to get their funds out of BitCoin and back into a fiat currency. This will, in turn, continue to bring down the value of BitCoin until it eventually becomes worthless. I see this as an inevitability, as the supply of BitCoins is supposedly pre-determined, while demand can fluctuate rapidly. BitCoin is doomed to failure.

CMV.	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1nhd47/i_think_that_every_worldview_is_valuable_and/	"Throughout my very short life, I cultivated an idea in myself that all worldviews held by people have some element of truth or validity in them. I am defining ""having an element of truth or validity"" as ""a concept, idea, or worldview, that has empirical, anecdotal, and/or psychological evidence to support it, that could be believed by someone with a rational mind"". A pretty inclusive definition to be sure, but I am not entirely convinced that scientific thought is the absolute best and most valuable way to approach the world. But that is another CMV entirely. 

I also believe that as long as a worldview does not advocate for the killing or harming of anyone based on anything other than the fact they've harmed others, and includes some capacity for empathy, it is going to inevitably be able to contribute something to the world. It is a difficult idea to express in words, as it doesn't work well with hypothetical: it is an idea that is predicated on the complexity and humanness inherent in everyone. And the concept is already kinda messy, and my explanation of it is even messier. But, hey, let's see what happens. Convince me some worldviews are completely untrue and invaluable, basically. 

EDIT: Okay, responding to you guys has helped me articulate what I mean when I say ""truth"" or ""value"". Those aren't really good words to use, I am going to instead say I believe every worldview is rational, and that it is extremely important for people to be able to empathize with every and all worldviews, because then, if it's destructive, you can better help to change said view, or if it's not, perhaps you can learn from it, even if you don't agree with it. That is possibly what I meant by value, but it isn't really value. It is less a statement about validity, and more a statement about how I choose to live my life - by constantly assuming people are relatively intelligent and reach the conclusions they reach because of a rational thinking process that has been shaped by their social and biological schemas. A person who believes that dinosaurs didn't exist isn't simply too stupid to comprehend scientific fact: they have a deeply ingrained belief about a higher power, possibly influenced by a biological disposition to believe in a higher power, having been told from a very young age that there is a higher power and young Earth creationism is how the world happened... if you believe in absolutes, it is rational to believe anything that violates those absolutes is a lie, especially if you believe that it is your destiny to be constantly prosecuted for your beliefs. They aren't simply stupid."	5	30

2 - Wedges have greater surface area on the side of the wedge means you canscoop up dip or sauce or even other food similar to a chip. Whereas fries are generally thin and spindly meaning you can dip, but you can't carry anything of substance unless you cram your face with multiple fries at a time.

3 - They are larger which means they don't go cold as quickly and are easier to reheat without worrying about burning.

Of course there are some exceptions like those think cut fries you get at A&amp;W which are essentially a wedge-fry hybrid, but for 90% of cases a wedge is superior to a fry.

Just for comparison I mean [wedges like these](https://goo.gl/images/2NhFnl). Not the [lazy ass baked potato chunks like these](https://goo.gl/images/PH3VvV). I guess I prefer the potato slices more than wedges.

For those of you saying ""but wedges aren't as crispy"" they need to be crispy. They get cooked longer due to the thickness and this causes the exterior to be crisper.

Apparently what I consider wedges are actually steak fries.

I still hold that they are the best kind of fry, but that they are fries."	38	60

But these same people tend to denounce trump backing out of the Iran nuclear deal to push towards a stronger, more harsh crackdown on Iran. Iran is no saint in terms of human rights either, so if we should be harsh on Saudi why should we not be harsh on Iran? Now personally I agree that Trump shouldn't have backed the US out of the Iran deal. However, I think it is better to be peaceful and do business with countries such as Saudi Arabia, even in spite of their human rights abuses, than it is to become their enemy and possibly cause unrest and violence. That doesn't mean we should support their policies, but I don't think we should just completely cut a country off and treat it like an enemy because some of it's laws are backwards.	5	25

Basically, if a man can be topless somewhere, so to should a women. Hell the surface (As in the part we see) of breasts isn't really any different by sex.

Examples of what is definately wrong:
1. ""Best food in town"" (even if its currently true it won't be forever)
2. Customer satisfaction or customer opinions about a product (customer opinions are fine as long as they are not used as advertising material)
3. ""Great value"", ""Cheap"" etc (what's cheap for you might not be cheap for me - especially if the shop has managed to buy it cheaper than what they're selling it for)

I strongly believe that, provided there is significant reason to believe [a large enough pool of people](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/dominic-grieve-brexit-second-eu-referendum-legal-former-attorney-general-says-7119491.html) have changed their minds, a second referendum will show Britons want to stay in the EU which will have a positive long-term effect for both EU and UK. 


It will send a strong signal to the EU Parliament that there are a lot of issues which need addressing, however it will protect the current trade agreements and preserve the status quo (if we can call it that).

It might polarize the country further but this will be short-lived as people will soon move on to their daily problems. 

The whole ordeal is expensive but the price of it will be significantly less then that of renegotiating every single EU directive and agreement individually [citation needed, obviously].

What I'm not sure about is: what are the political implications of a second referendum? Would any parliament ever consider the possibility of looking like chumps if the outcome is the same? Even if it's not, wouldn't this ooze political insecurity and indecisiveness? Is it likely that MPs are stalling the triggering of Chapter 50 in hopes that people will ask for a second referendum?

CMV	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19zsms/i_think_democracy_is_a_terrible_form_of/	"People believe that the superiority of democracy is self-evident and a staple in any free society, but I don't see how it's more liberating than any other form of government; monarchies are ruled by kings/queens, aristocracies are ruled by an upper class, and democracy is ruled by the majority.  Either way, some individual/group has the upper hand.  I don't understand why the majority is a better ruler than any other option.

I feel like this causes a distinct problem in some ways, one that's not present in a government that's run by a smaller group of individuals.  In any community, you want a leader that is informed, right?  And in a democracy, the people are the leaders, so you'd want the people as a whole to be well informed, right?  This is rarely the case, as very few people actually know exactly how America's modern day government works; never mind political theory or history.  Most people have no incentive to stay informed, because they can still vote regardless of whether they actually know what they're doing or not.

In virtually every academic field of study, important decisions are almost always made by trained, knowledgeable professionals who are generally respected in the community and fully understand everything involved.  I don't understand why politics should be any different.  When you form a community with a common goal and a few basic principles, it is clear that there are a few methods that work and many methods that don't towards any given end.  If we want to, say, fix an economic crisis, I think we can all agree that there are policies that **will** work and others that **won't**.  If I say solution A is the best and you say solution B is the best, either one of us is right or both of us are wrong.  I don't understand why this needs to be voted on by everybody.

Same with ""rights"".  If a government realizes that something is violating some groups' ""rights"", why should we vote on it?  If it's violating their rights, change it.  ""Rights"" don't seem like something that need to be agreed on by at least 51% of the population.

I could literally spend a copious amount of time and effort studying political theory, historical trends, and formulating pragmatic solutions to our current political issues, and my vote will count just as much as someone who walks into the booth on voting day and picks whatever option makes the coolest anagrams.  To me, that's not freedom.  That's absurd.

Also, people rarely put the whole of society ahead of their own self interests.  If you went in to vote right now, of course you'd vote for a policy that, say, lowers your taxes; everyone would.  Everyone likes lowering their own taxes, but what if that means that many other important things need to be cut as a result of the lower budget?

Representative democracy is even worse; you don't get options for candidates who will actually improve the state of a nation, you just get candidates who know how to make their own agenda appeal the majority biases.  Well-informed political scientists can never reasonably measure up to great orators and rhetoricians, and the political sphere becomes a popularity contest instead of a platform for actual issues to be solved.

I'm here because everyone insists that democracy is the only way for a society to be free, so I want to see if I'm missing something.  The idea that everyone's political opinion is equal sounds nice, but just seems completely indefensible to me.  So... change my view."	11	43
