CMV	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aenyc/i_have_been_forced_by_my_job_to_go_into/	"this comes from a long line of issues of bullying from colleagues where i work as an apprentice electrical engineer
 they have made life difficult from day one and always used when ive complained the power of numbers (i.e three people with this story one with the other)
Ive never been a people person but i can deal with people and I have got lots of friends, just in different bubbles to where i work.
when they push me too far and i get angry but Ive never thrown a punch Ive only ever yelled.
Part of my job is going to a college in Wiltshire England the opposite end of the UK to where I am from Benbecula Scotland so i dont know anyone and i have spent an awful lot of the last two years lonely.

but now they've labeled me as having a fucking type of Autism and everyone around me sees completely fine with this and ive got to just be treat like a child that cant look after himself I havent lived at home for TWO YEARS! i am completely independant from my parents but my work still have the fucking CHEEK to tell them whats happening to me before telling me. 

I am not autistic, i have not got an anger problem, I work my ass off I pay my own way like an adult, I do all the shite parts of growing up but for some reason I am not entitled to any of the basic respect!

CMV	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d6qf4/i_think_that_broadcast_television_is_a_waste_of/	"Recently, a [company](https://www.aereo.com/) was sued by various over-the-air broadcasters for allowing customers to 'rent' a receiver to watch live television over the Internet. As a result, [Fox Broadcasting threatened to take their stations off the air](http://mashable.com/2013/04/08/fox-aereo/) if they lose the lawsuit. The fact that this service is even technically possible and that Fox thinks it makes more business sense to lose the broadcast market to ensure that they are paid re-transmit fees by everyone who views their programming shows that the world has changed to the point broadcast television is no longer the best use of the spectrum it has been allocated. Most Americans do not get their television programming over the air anyways, and I think that we could provide basic satellite, cable or IPTV service those few who do.

Make no mistake, the TV Bands are [prime real-estate](http://urbanomnibus.net/redux/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/allochrt.jpg) in terms of RF spectrum 

Several years ago, the standards for broadcast TV changed to allow high-definition programming to fit in a smaller channel width than had previously been used. This widely-publicized switch to digital television freed a chunk of the UHF TV band, that the FCC later auctioned off to Verizon. Using this new spectrum, Verizon deployed their new 4G LTE network, providing mobile data to millions of customers. 

Others have proposed using other parts of the TV band for WIFI like devices. These 'white spaces' devices use spread spectrum and frequency hopping to stay out of the way of Television broadcast signals. If they were given the entire band, an entire new generation of mobile and wireless broadband Internet access could be created. 

So, why should we preserve broadcast TV?"	4	17

The Arab indigenous population had a long historical uninterrupted connection to the land and ownership of it. While the Jewish population had minimal presence in the region.

The holocaust gave no special permission to the Jewish people to act like their former oppressors or right to any land. 

I am not anti-semitic or Arab. I would hold my views if Israel was Christan, Islamic, Buddhist, or what have you. I do not deny that the holocaust happened.

Edit1: 
[Article 1 section 1](http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter1.shtml) of the UN Charter states ""To maintain international peace and security"". A state created from acts of terrorism, assassination, and ethnic cleansing from the lands does not to hold to the spirit of the Charter so any support given to Israel was illegal.

[Article 1 section 2](http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter1.shtml) and [Article 73 main text and section a](http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter11.shtml) talks about ""self-determination"" and the ""inhabitants"". These, I believe, refers solely to the long term inhabitants, including Jewish people, of the land not the immigrants, legal and illegal, that showed up and demanded rights they had no claim to. 

The holocaust while terrible did not give any special permissions or rights to the Jewish people. They did not gain the right to claim a land that they had no greater claim to then anyone else.

The US was created in a different time then Israel. If it was created within the framework of today's laws it would be illegal. It however was created in a time where wars were fought to gain land. By both the European settlers and the Natives. This resulted in the Europeans, who were better armed, to take a great deal of land and commit a lot of atrocities. There was however no real legal system that prohibited the atrocities and they were basically common practice by both sides. Non of that make it moral but it does make the founding of the US legal. Now with Israel there were laws in place, imo, prohibiting the creation of the State of Israel in the manner in which it was created."	120	240

1. From a emotional/mental health standpoint, passion is an emotional state that cannot or should not be sustained. Passions and interests come and go, they wax and wane. When we dive into something, we often need time to recover and step away. The routine and grind of a job does not allow this ebb and flow and can burn someone out of their interest. The structure of work requires a steady, even and predictable range of performance. 

2. From a professional/economic perspective, if you are laboring for money, you should find something you can do well and maximize your earning. Maintaining separation of interests/hobbies and money making labor is often more practical than trying to merge them.

3. Interests often become passions because they are pursued for their own sake. If they are pursued for money, that changes how we relate to the pursuits. In reverse, if the pursuit of money is fruitless or frustrating, that taints our interest.

4. The internalization of the advice creates a seeking, grass is greener mindset of unrealistic expectations about what work is, how to be professional and anxiety that they are not doing what they love when they are doing what they can be paid for. "	3	3

CMV	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1gtkiw/i_think_some_criminal_lawyers_are_just_as_bad_as/	I think some criminal lawyers are just as bad as the criminals they represent. Lawyers, despite their original intentions when finding their career path, care more about money than justice. They will help a guilty criminal get away with their crimes because if they are good at it, people will pay them a lot to do it. I think that knowingly helping a wrongdoer evade justice is just as bad, if not worse, than the original crime. What's more, I find it awful that despite everyone in the courtroom knowing the defendant is guilty, lawyers can manipulate the case in their favor, regardless of the truth. I don't think this opinion is true, because I'm sure any system, even in America, couldn't be *that* broken. I want to change this view because I think I just irrationally hate an entire profession.	6	9

CMV	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1gx12i/i_believe_that_modern_libertarians_are_exchanging/	"Government, at least in principle, serves the function of promoting general welfare. It costs efficiency because of the large amount of bureaucracy required to maintain transparency. I recognize the failings of government, but baby and bathwater, etc.

Corporations, on the other hand, exist solely to separate you from your money. They explicitly try to provide as little value to the citizenry as possible. Libertarians love to point out the occasional success of ""good business"", but provide very little solid statistical evidence of the success rate of generous businesses. Aggressive, nearly psychopathic behavior is most often rewarded. The less compassion and generosity, the greater the business efficiency.

Libertarianism holds the belief that the people will be able to boycott or otherwise influence corporations into being well behaved, but if the very same people who can't hold accountable an organization explicitly dictated to be transparent and good-willed, how are they supposed to hold an entity responsible that has no such desire?

Capitalism concentrates wealth and I believe that most modern libertarians believe that they are somehow going to fall into the 0.1% that will eventually accumulate all the wealth; they feel a general disconnect from the rest of humanity - apart from, and ubiquitously, better than everyone else. They are fooled by small amounts of wealth given to the 99-99.8% in order to support the long term goals of the true power holders.

I understand the failings of government, but those are almost entirely due to the failures of the people to regulate their governments. My belief hinges on the fact that the ignorance and apathy of the common man is far more exploitable by corporations and capitalists than governments."	97	336

Christ. I didn't know what I was in for. 24 hour and almost a thousand comments later, I'm throwing in the &amp;#8710;

My view didn't do a 180, but maybe a 90 degree shift, which is a change. /u/meshugga was not the only one to help shape my view, but he was the first to meet me with an solution we both tentatively accepted.

My goal from the outset was to carve out a legal ""safe zone"" for men who did not want to be fathers. That safe zone was *always* intended to have criteria, and so a good 500 of these comments discussing men sleeping around or being serial fathers was always a red-herring to me. They were never who I was trying to protect.

I had hoped to have this legal safe zone extended until the window for abortion had closed. I had hoped this would be reasonable. Apparently, some women might feel some attachment to their unborn offspring. Women, amirite? /u/meshugga, /u/OakTable and /u/yangYing contribuited to my concession that this would present a whole host of problems, both with unscrupulous men, and the difficulty of the womans choice.

The position that I have settled on, and I believe is the closest approximation to ""fair"", would be the existence of pre-conception legal statements which include both a mans (un)willingness to become a father, and a womans (un)willingness to become a mother.

Since the chief concern in my experience has been A) women lying and going off the pill to ""trap"" a man into fatherhood, B) a partner who previously agreed they would get an abortion who then changes their mind upon pregnancy, I think this solution would at least offer an option to help men, and C) the consistence use of reasonable contraception failed.

This would obviously be socially awkward (as another use put it, a ""douchebag warning""), but I am more concerned about the existence of such a legal safe zone, than its social viability. I just want the option to be there, so in the event of the unfortunate, it can always be said ""well, you had that option to prevent this"".

But I feel that opinion is vastly different from the bankrupt and often counterproductive F*CK COPS movement.

I many justifications.

**Here's a short list:**

* I was raised to cooperate with police.
* I have never, and don't plan on experimenting with drugs.
* I'm black/African American

Alternatively, 

* I am, from a relative standpoint, socioeconomically advantaged.

Despite this, I have had run ins with the police.

Three involved African American officers, and while I don't count those (esp two since they involved rental cops) the last was a more tense pullover, in which i was told to turn my lights on, but left with a warning because I guess he was in a good mood or something. Also, maybe my appearance and demeanor [having been told to cooperate, shy away, etc, hands on the wheel type crap.]

In two that I remember, the officers were white. In one of the traffic stops, I was speeding, and the officer whipped his car around the four lane highway before pulling me over. All my white friends were in the back being goofballs, shouting ""cops are pigs and fck cops."" I hushed them, while having the ins and outs about driving with the officer. After being released, I was told I grossly bended to authority, though everything I know and understand previously would have me feeling otherwise.

**Longer Explanations of some things**

* Like I said, My parents, from a young age, taught me to cooperate with officers whenever in an unfavorable situation. **To this day it has worked without incident. I also can't help but feel that Trayvon's aggression in part, played a role in what happened.** I watch countless youtube videos in which (mostly) white boys film the cops and skateboard throughout building entrances, and I empathize with their courage, but consider it otherworldly and irrational.

* Also, It should be said that my parents are well off, having successful careers and what not. We deviate strongly from the ""typical black family"" (as our entire neighborhood seems to (considering the minority families). I have no siblings, we vacation a lot, etc (lol personally, I consider myself a penniless leech and understand my position fully,). We are by no means the one percent, but

1.   Daily commuting time has one of the strongest [negative effects on happiness and well-being](http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/2010/03/30/commuting/) . This includes lower trust, lower fitness, pains, higher risks of diseases, etc, and obviously much time lost. [About 540 hours yearly](http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=392456) is spent in a car.

1. The environmental, geopolitical, economic and health effects of driving grossly fuel inefficient cars for the transport are enormous. Accounting for the costs might be difficult, but most cars are clearly excessive for their transport needs.

Therefore banning advertisement on most cars would reduce the materialistic desire and status of these dangerous, miserable, and unsustainable products. 

In Europe taxes on cars (especially heavy and fuel inefficient ones) are very substantial - at about the cost of the car itself - as well as the fuel taxes on using them. *All this is not unlike cigarettes.*

**So why is advertisement on cars - except those which are compact, green, and self-driven - still allowed? CMV.**

Good acting, well-written dialogue, decently believable characters (for the most part), but the story made no sense. Three loosely connected episodes, not in chronological order, rambling on and on without a real point to them. Characters showing up that look like they came from another movie, then disappearing just as suddenly. The middle story (with Bruce Willis as a boxer) had some sort of plot to it but the others were just endless random chit-chat punctuated by occasional violence and loud shouting.

In the first story, one of the characters asks why we feel the need to fill time with meaningless smalltalk. I feel like the same question needs to be asked of the writer of this movie.

As a Harry Potter fan I noticed a lot of sub-plots being ignored to focus on the main story due to time constraints. The worst case of this was #4 where they skipped sub-plots entirely because the book was so long. 

When a book is adapted well to TV, like Game of Thrones, it has the time to follow every part of the book closely. When making a movie, many producers try to keep the rating PG-13 or below for revenue's sake. It seems on TV you are more free to be faithful to the source material and include all the sex and violence that you need.

This has benefits for the studios too. Seasons last a few months which keeps the audience thinking about the story. People will talk about it on the internet and in person generating more interest for the series. 

This way also seems to be cheaper. HBO makes 10 hours of Game of Thrones for $70m (and exceptionally high budget for a TV show), without compromising on special effects, sets, actors, or production value, while a movie costs over $100m."	13	6

By the time I finished GoF, I was in love with the series, but always had reservations about The Prisoner of Azkaban.

In my opinion, the best books in the series are the ones in which Harry's life is in direct danger from Voldemort or his forces, most obviously in The Chamber of Secrets, The Goblet of Fire, and The Deathly Hallows. At the time I read it, and ever since, I found the third book to be absent of danger or risk. Harry spends most of the book in fear of Sirius Black, who ends up being a misunderstood ally. Voldemort pretty much does nothing to hurt Harry (they hardly talk about him IIRC), leaving 400 pages to introducing characters and fleshing out teenage angst.

Now, I'm not saying it's a bad book. I think every HP book is a great achievement in its own right. But I had, and still have, a lot of friends who thought the third book was by far the best in the series, and their reasons were never very convincing (there are werewolves, there is time travel, there is backstory, therefore it's cooler than the rest).

I still feel weird about Incest due to social conditioning and whatnot but I realise it's practically the same as straight and gay love...
If you argue that it's weird because they come from the same bloodline, that's not really an argument, more of a statement like when people say ""but they're both the same gender..."" and Incest is observed in nature and even a part of evolution.

I would never practice incest, nor would I have sex with a person of the same gender but that's just me and how I feel, but I support them both. Would you really take away the rights of some people? The same rights that homosexuals have fought so hard to get, even interracial marriage some time ago.

The ""blurred lines"" refer to those of consent. He's clearly forcing himself on her. ""I know you want it""? Why would he have to repeatedly assert this if she actually ""[wanted] it""? 

How could this possibly be considered anything but sexist? In its essence, this song is a man telling a woman that she wants to have sex with him when she has given no such indications.

The view that I have been thinking about is this: In the same way elitism exists in real life, it exists in skill-based, competitive gaming.  In the real world, elitists think that they have some quality or ancestry that affords them greater influence or authority than others--they think they are ""better"" than other people intrinsically.  I want to discuss whether this exists in E-Sports: high-skilled players being ""endowed"" by their talent, skill-level, or competitive results in such a way that causes them to ignore the basic human value of another person (in other words: commit social injustice).

Recently, while reading about all the government workers who have been furloughed, I couldn't help but think, ""good, fuck those people"", even though I know that they are all genuinely being screwed at the moment. I really started to feel this way a few years ago when I was commuting to university by bus. The workers were threatening to strike over something ridiculous (getting paid 28 dollars an hour to drive a bus was not enough). Luckily they did not end up striking, but had they done so I would have had no other legitimate way of getting to school. Good anecdote, time for some arguments:


1. Public Unions cause massive amounts of bloat in budgets. Their members are usually paid above market value and red tape and backwards work requirement lead to higher costs for governments.

2. They are inherently monopolistic which gives them massive bargaining power. When teachers go on strike, parents have to scramble to find something to do with their kids, teachers know this and  use it (this happened in Ontario recently). There is no competition in the public sector. They can be as wasteful and inefficient as they want and no one can do anything because there are no other alternatives.

3. Public Union strikes hold tax payers hostage. Taxpayers get fucked twice, once when they have to pay up and then again when there is a strike.

4. (This one in more of a personal view) I don't really see why public sector unions even exist. I understand that private unions are needed so that workers aren't overpowered by profit driven corporations. But government services aren't run ""for profit"".

It is almost a certainty that I will, at some point in my career, be forced into a co-teaching position where I will need to collaborate with a special education teacher.  Even if this does not happen, I will absolutely have students will IEPs (Individual Education Plans) in my classroom, for whom I will have to integrate special instruction.  We are already required to include ""differentiation"" into our lesson plans, accounting for the high, middle and low achievers in class.  

The inclusion of special education in public classrooms is being taught as a civil rights act akin to desegregation.  Of course, I believe it is a civil right to be educated, but I believe students with special needs, require just that...special attention.  This attention, or variation in instruction, takes away from the quality of education I am able to provide to the rest of the class.  Why should students with disabilities not be in a learning environment designed to provide special instruction, by teachers who have been trained to do so?  Not to mention the budget is stretched thin in large part to the floating and in-class specialists assigned to students with disabilities.  

I understand that students with disabilities are not all cognitively impaired, and thus are capable of learning like other students.  There are also issues with misdiagnoses and over-diagnoses.  However, these students require special assistance and I believe they should be put in an environment that can focus solely on accommodating their disability, in order to give them the best education possible.  I've had an experience where a parent said they were not concerned with whether or not their child learned anything, they just wanted (for their child) the social experience of a general education classroom.  How am I supposed to accept this when I am getting evaluated on the progress of my students?

This is a reality of the profession I chose, and I do not want to continue feeling this way.  Please CMV. "	14	16

First of all, I agree that you should go to college to get a valuable degree that allows you to live a comfortable life. However, college is in great part indeed about finding yourself and expanding your world view, and that's a lot of their added value compared to, let's say, a trade school. Being able to take a subject like tai-chi or circus abilities while getting your major allows you to do that, besides letting you balance your course load. "	29	25

It would generate billions in tax revenue. Disassociating drug use with its various social stigmas would help to prevent abuse; by not reinforcing negative stereotypes, people would have less motivation to act self-destructively. It would take money out of the pockets of violent drug lords, our war on drugs is the only reason they've become billionaires, and put it in service to the public. It would free police officers, federal agents, etc. to focus on violent/unsavory criminals. Legalization would promote demilitarization of domestic police force.

Increasing global wealth is something that does not only benefit the 1st world, but has also benefited the 3rd world (after all, the number of countries with a 1600's level of economic development can be counted on one hand). This is ultimately where the vast majority of unnecessary deaths and suffering happen.

43% of global population lives with an income below $2 per day. This leads to situations where infectious diseases spread rampant due to lack of healthcare spending, and an uneducated population preventing improvement to quality of life. The way the 1st and 2nd world got over this was through industrialization, a word now associated in the 1st world with not progression but regression.

http://infobeautiful3.s3.amazonaws.com/2013/03/iib_death_wellcome_collection_fullsize.png explains my point about how bad infectious diseases are by counting the estimated number of deaths from all infectious diseases within the 20th century. 

Now, in 2013, the main areas suffering from these infectious diseases is the 3rd world. About 700,000 people die from malaria per year, 1.3 million from Tuberculosis. 

Now, to calculate how many people may die from Global Warming is a bit more difficult, but let's make a worse case estimate and say that we will increase rate of death from natural disasters 10fold what it is now. This has to be weather related natural disasters since global warming isn't going to affect plate tectonics.

Extreme weather killed 20m in the 20th century. In the 21st, if that goes up to 200m, then it's still a very minor issue compared to infectious diseases.

Most respiratory diseases are caused by air pollution not from industrialization, but from the burning of extremely poor fuels such as dung indoors in the 3rd world. This will actually go down as industrialization increases because though coal and oil is awful, the fuels currently used over much of the 3rd world is even worse.

Choosing between decreasing global warming and increasing global warming is often a case of having to pick one over the other. It's not disputable that decreasing pollution will be expensive, and some of this expense will definitely need to be borne by the third world simply because the third world needs to do dirty industrialization before they can even consider affording solar panels.

Given the harm caused by lack of wealth compared to increased global temperature, I believe it is in the best global interest to prioritize wealth. When comparing the harm of infectious diseases to that of global warming, then global warming does feel like a 1st world problem."	6	33

CMV.	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1scl2n/i_feel_like_our_current_political_system_is_a/	"I'm constantly told that both sides are evil and that voting doesn't matter, and to an extent I'm starting to believe it. I am a Democrat and I believe the Democrats are the lesser of the two evils, but they are still politicians that are swayed by big business and lobbyists. 

These big businesses in turn use political influence to stifle real political discourse and in turn control everything that is said on the media. For every one voter that actually takes the time to do real research (which is still potentially mired by all of the false, biased information out there), there are ten, maybe more, that listen to what Fox or CNN tell them to believe and think nothing of it because it's all they know. The system does not encourage people to get real education of real issues.  

At this point, most politicians are being bankrolled by big business in some way and make their decisions based on this, and if they dare fight, they'll be crushed by a different candidate that is willing to be their puppet. Moreover, I believe any attempt to change this situation by voting is useless, because it is like asking the cat to guard the cream. Why would any politician vote for lobbying reform if they directly benefit from this political bribery, especially when there are hundreds of congresspeople that are just like him that are happy slaves of big business? Why would anyone vote to change 'first-past-the-post' when all it does it give third-parties a better chance at dethroning them? They were already elected, they don't have an incentive to change a damn thing. They just voted to put a lobbyist in the FCC chair, unanimously. 

It would take a tremendous voting effort, from an enormous amount of educated people, to even begin to effect any real change, fighting an uphill battle the entire time against the controlled media and stupid, sheep-like single issue voters that will vote one party or another no matter what, and never think to support a grassroots third party candidate, because big business has programmed the majority to vote for their chosen candidates, and don't give a damn about the few that think critically.

Even though I vote, I believe our votes are largely being bought and paid for, and controlled by corporate-driven mainstream media, and our democracy is being managed to give us the illusion of choice when there truly is little hope of any major change that threatens the system. The more I talk to people about the state of things more hopeless I feel. 

**TL;DR:** Our political system is being gamed in a way that prevents meaningful change, because the only ones with the power to make changes are paid by corporations to resist it, and the ones that can vote to get rid of those politicians are fed falsehoods through the media controlled by the same corporations.

CMV.	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1suq0i/i_believe_that_most_muslims_will_always_view_gay/	"It is perhaps the largest fly in the ointment of the left-wing worldview: when persecuted minorities persecute other people, and there's no other reason for it than religion, blind hatred of the other, or some unholy combination of the two. India, a country with almost 200 million Muslims, just re-criminalized gay sex after a soul-crushingly brief window of four years of governmental indifference on the subject. In the vast majority of Muslim countries, sex between men is punished with prison time or death (the record for lesbianism is more mixed). Of the countries that kill men (and boys under 18) for their homosexuality, all espouse Islamist visions of the state. The ones that don't criminalize gay sex (like Turkey and Iraq) often sought Western, secular models of governance and hence adopted a more moderate stance on the state's intrusion into citizens' private lives.

As a proudly left-wing individual (and a gay man) this situation disturbs me quite intensely. One of my best friends grew up in California in a liberal, suburban atmosphere across the bay from San Francisco itself. Despite our very close friendship, his Muslim views have locked his mind into the position that heterosexuality deserves a higher status in society and has repeatedly expressed indifference toward the crimes against humanity committed against gay men by the governments of Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and others. Having grown up and lived in the US all his life, he's a very moderate Muslim in most ways, but the fact that homosexuals still offend him on some level testifies to me that the religion of Islam (by which I mean its texts) must promulgate a rabidly negative view of homosexuality and homosexual love, a view whose presence in Islamic law he does not deny. 

I grew up in an American household of extremely integrated secular Jews and had a difficult enough time coming out at the age of sixteen. I can only imagine what it must be like for a gay teenager in rural Iran who is told to deny and rip apart his inner psyche for his whole life, to never reveal his true self to anyone in the world. What a hellish nightmare of an existence it must be for him. I have deep concern that Muslim communities in the West, even after several generations of integration, won't ever accept homosexuality as a natural phenomenon in the human tapestry, that they'll always view it as a problem created by the West, one that only pertains to Western families who suffer from a lack of familial cohesion. Please, I implore you, change my view. I need to know that one day things will get better for these teenagers suffering in silence. My research into even the most moderate strands of Islam has only cemented in my mind the deeply troubling (and just horrifically sad) idea that most Muslims will always view gay men as sinful creatures."	11	27

CMV.	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1t19az/i_believe_that_men_who_get_involved_in/	"Almost every anti-circumcision male I've met in real life has not been circumcised, and every pro-circumcision male has. ""Sweeping generalisation!"" I hear you cry. Yes, it is a bit, but for the sake of this argument I'm going to ignore the odd anti-circumcision, circumcised male who's pissed off at his parents for going through with the op when he was a baby, or the pro-circumcision male that doesn't want to have the op himself (does that happen?). **This has confused some people, please see my edit at the bottom**.

I am a circumcised male living in a predominantly uncircumcised area in the UK. I was, which may come as shocking to some Americans, bullied for not having a foreskin (I mistakenly told some friends when I was like, 12). Ever since then, any conversation I've been involved in about circumcision has been influenced by the fact that I am circumcised. I accept that. But I think the same goes for males who are *not* circumcised.

When I was 18, I had a sexual partner, but a lot of my friends at the time were virgins, yet they'd often tell me how better sex feels for uncircumcised men. It would piss me off a bit and I would retaliate by saying things like ""you haven't had sex at all, nevermind with a circumcised penis, so how the hell do you know?"". ""Nerve endings!"" I hear you cry. ""Isn't sex also a mental/spiritual process to many people?!"" I reply. Anyway, this is besides the point - I'm not here for a circumcision debate. The fact is, men who were circumcised at childhood will never experience sex with a foreskin, and men who have never been circumcised don't know what it feels like without one. Therefore, they are both biased, and both only see half the picture. So why should either sides be believed in this aspect on the debate?

The above paragraph was just one example of bias when it comes to circumcision, and I can't really think of any more right now. To be honest, maybe the only people who should be taken seriously when it comes to this debate are woman, who don't have penises. Yes, I am likely to stand up and say ""hey, circumcision isn't that bad"" whenever physicality is brought into the discussion *because I am circumcised*, but it's easier for uncircumcised men to argue against something that isn't a part of them.

Thank you for reading, hopefully my ramblings make some sense and you can offer your input.

**TL;DR**: Pro-circumcision males tend to be circumcised, anti-circumcision males tend to be uncircumcised. Both present arguments that are effected by their own experiences. Therefore neither should be taken completely seriously as they don't see the whole picture. Change my view. 

**EDIT**: A lot of people are saying things like ""I'm against circumcision despite being circumcised, therefore case dismissed"" - this doesn't change my argument, though I'll admit that perhaps my wording was confusing. There are four possibilities: a circumcised male who is pro-circumcision; a circumcised male who is anti-circumcision; an uncircumcised male who is anti-circumcision; an uncircumcised male who is pro-circumcision. All four are examples of men who have, IMO, biased views which depend on how they look at their experience. "	58	85

Essentially my view is that by indulging their fear you are doing them a disservice by legitimizing it, not to mention doing yourself a disservice by taking the more dangerous route (driving)

Some other places this comes up: fear of certain sports, like rock climbing or kayakin, fear of getting mugged or assaulted, fear of equipment failure like roller coasters, etc. In all of those cases I think people should refuse to inconvenience themselves to indulge someone with an irrational fear.

CMV	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1uarui/i_believe_that_nihilism_is_the_only_rational/	"Essentially, it is my position that the entire universe has no rationally discernible purpose for existing, nor does any other thing in the universe (except technology) have any rationally discernible purpose for existing.  

(I choose to define technology as things made by intelligences applying creativity to naturally occurring elements or other technology.)

Reality does not appear to have a designer.  There is no clear need for a designer to exist, no obvious designer has stepped forward, and the various claims put forward for proof of a designer are...lacking in evidence.  If there is a designer, then perhaps the universe does have a purpose, but there is no way to know what that purpose is.

Without a designer, we have a universe that simply exists.  Apparently it exists because this happens to be a stable arrangement for all this matter energy stuff, which apparently exists because *why the fuck not*. It might have something to do with an infinite number of potential states of existence.  Or something.  We will never know for sure.  Maybe, someday, we will actually figure out some experiment that will prove a theory and we will know *HOW* reality came to be.

But why?  Why does this all exist?  Why am I here?  Why are you here?  or the real brain-buster: *Why do duck-billed platypus exist?*  What is the point of that?   

That's the big joke on all of us.  We will never know for sure.  We *cannot* know for sure.  To claim otherwise is to engage in *the first intellectual deception*.  It is to claim knowledge *a priori*, that pernicious refuge of scoundrels, knowledge without fact or evidence.  You know because you know.

If we are honest, we must admit that if there is a purpose to the universe, we cannot know what it is.  If we admit we cannot know there is a purpose to the universe, then we must admit that there is essentially no purpose to the universe.

Thus when we talk about philosophical issues, and ask questions like ""How should I act?"" and ""What should I do with my life?"" or ""Can I kill Justin Bieber?,"" we must always start from the position that there is no purpose in existence, and that the rules are either physical laws of existence, which are trivial (in the Wittgenstein sense of trivia), or they are things we have chosen to believe are true.

Anyone want to change my view?  Can you convince me that reality has a purpose other than ""Whatever I want it to be today?"" "	34	93

Later, in the feminist movement, (still according to Russel) they sought to lose all the derogatory labels on women, save that of saintliness.

I don't deny that sexism exists, but there seems to be a ""good"" sexism and ""bad"" sexism; anti-male sexism is fine, because men have to suck it up and be noble for the ""saintly"" ladies' sakes but anti-female sexism is like carving a satanic symbol on the Sistine Chapel ceiling; if you even seem sexist, you will be impaled on the pitchfork of society(without the metaphorical section of the atheist population who will cheer you on).

Examples: Divorce courts, car insurance, rape. Even the Google Science Fair 2013, I suspect, only let one of the entries reach the finals because they were girls from Afganistan. 

One of my teachers decided to split the class into groups and I quote: ""Seeing as women are so discriminated in our day and age, all group leaders will be female.""

I commonly hear people say that most CEOs are white males. Which may be true, but we should ask ourselves: do we think this because we have relevant factual evidence or is it because the moment we think ""CEO"" WE think of a white male?"" In which case you're as guilty as everyone else for this corporate sexism. And occupations do, at times, seem to be very male-exclusive(e.g. fire fighter, soldier) but there are occupations that seem very female-exclusive (e.g. secretary, nurse). And if you complain that the latter jobs are demeaning and consist of more menial work, I can assure you that you are far less likely to die from being a secretary than plunging into buildings engulfed in flames.

CMV.	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1v2dfn/i_think_if_youre_aware_of_how_the_animals_are/	"Let me start off by making clear, I feel in no way superior to other people by the choice of my food/diet. And I hope we can go around the whole subject of me being a preachy vegan, because I'm actually a pretty liberal person. I ate meat when I was younger, but when I grew up I found out what harm was put on the animals and what effect it had on the environment, too. So I think if people are aware of the causes for producing meat but continues to do nothing about it are horrible people because they support torture and killing of innocent creatures, without giving a shit.
EDIT: First of all, thank you for all the answers! Posted it before going to bed hoping I'd have a few (10 or so) answers when I woke up, didn't expect 150+ answers! But lots of reading to do! :)
Second of all, I realize now that the word horrible was a little too much. And I don't think you, my friends or family are horrible either. 
Lastly: I didn't come here to call anyone horrible, but rather having changed my view so I can understand and accept other people for their choices even though they're not the same as mine. "	10	165

I couldn't care less. I just don't think it's a big deal. There's plenty of ups that I feel people aren't thinking about, and are mostly just complaining based solely off of principle.

Positives that I think are worth it:

* With ads tailored to me, I *MIGHT* just see an ad for something I care about
* Selling this information to advertisers allows these companies to continue to be profitable/viable without charging me money.
* they're not selling your social security number or your credit card information, just a list of things you've bought on amazon, mostly harmless shit.

Alternatives that are bad (imo):

* these services go away
* these services start charging
* these services start running with a bunch of ads (banners/pop-ups)
* these services start selling information that matters, but in a more clandestine fashion (i.e. phone numbers and credit card info)

In general I feel like people who complain about this think far too highly of themselves. Even if companies or the government *is* watching, what makes you think they care?

Per my usual joke when this gets brought up with friends:
&gt;""But they're selling your information!""

&gt;""Ha! Joke's on them! My information is worthless!""

Please keep in mind that in many of my posts I'm having to reiterate that I'm arguing the current implementation of information gathering/selling. I'm not arguing that I'd idly sit by in a 1984 event. Also on that same vein, I'm mostly talking private corporations, not the government. Thanks and keep debating!

In my opinion, the only reason why someone would rather play such a system if they have access to the latest ones is 1.- emotional value (completely valid reason, I've done it too) 2.- saying that older systems or videogames are ""more fun"", ""less commercial"", with a ""deeper story"" (these are all subjective, but i believe that it is very unlikely) or playing just to get away from the mainstream.

This is the famous quote from Jaden Smith's Twitter account.  After giving it some thought, I'm pretty sure he's not meaning any of this literally.  What he means by ""Our Eyes Aren't Real"" is that what we perceive with our own eyes isn't necessarily reality.  I don't know that too many people could argue that we don't all see the world differently, and not always as it really is.  Now the Mirror represents how we see ourselves.  So basically what he's saying is ""How can we get an accurate perception of ourselves if we cannot get an accurate perception of reality?"".  I think the statement may be a little over dramatized, but what do you expect from a teenager dabbling in philosophy?  So in the end, I don't think it's really that crazy of a statement.  CMV"	5	17

CMV.	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1yf2pu/i_believe_that_through_the_sapirwhorf_hypothesis/	"From wiki on linguistic relativity:

&gt;The principle of linguistic relativity holds that the structure of a language affects the ways in which its respective speakers conceptualize their world.

To me it seems like the common English speaking person doesn't know how to express themselves accurately.   I feel like we don't really have many ways in which we can elaborate on ourselves to understand each others emotions, and that our limited representation of the large amount of emotions causes misinformation. 

I speak in general but my largest bias is against the word love. Love is a rich field of emotions that are all generalized into just a few words. I'm sure there's hundreds of words that I can't personally think of, but I've rarely met people that know more than 4 or 5 words to express what can be called love. And even if you all can list however many words you know that range from affection to lust to desire, do you ever use those words? Do you ever yearn/romance/etc for you other(even if you act according to those words), or do you just love them? 

To be rude: I'd guess the uneducated have a harder time logically solving loves problems because of such submission to a single idea. 

I think I'm right though and would like to be wrong, because then it would seem like people aren't really that completely incompetent of observing a obvious problem. I try to be very expressive in my partnership, I think it does wonders for us emulating and mixing different types of love in extremity. It seems logical to me.

CMV	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1z3a3k/i_believe_fan_fiction_is_just_as_valuable_as/	"*Disclaimer: Because (excluding cross-overs) that's the only fandom i've read fanfics from, this post will include mentions of My Little Pony and the brony fandom. If references to these things give you rabies-like symptoms, allow me to redirect you [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bgzce/i_think_bronies_are_ridiculous_cmv/c96mpbo) or [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview).*

I think the title sums my position up pretty well. Fan fiction is often looked down upon as being somehow inferior to ""original"" works. Even the word ""fan fiction"" has a bad connotation. I, however, believe that fan fiction is just as valuable as any original work and that often good stories are dismissed/ignored because they are ""merely fan fiction"".

Now, to save some time, i will give some arguments against fan fiction that i can think of and will explain why i don't think they are valid:

**Fanfic's have poor quality.**

I'll admit there's a lot of bad fanfic, but i would like to remind people that there also a lot of truly horrible original works. Remember [Sturgeon's law](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StUrgeOnSlaw) (tvtropes link, so beware): ""90% of everything is crud.""

Basically, there are a lot of shitty fanfic's, but i know for a fact that there are also a lot of great fanfic's. Those that agree with me here can skip the bulletin points. For those that won't believe me i have some example's:

* [Vinyl and Octavia: University Days](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/13477/vinyl-and-octavia-university-days): O god it's a ship fic, right? I mean it even has an [explicit extra chapter](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/47227/university-nights). This has got to be horrible right? Well, no. It's actually a beautifull story about the problems that same-sex couples face and about the importance of becoming independent from your parents.
* [Fallout: Equestria](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/119190/fallout-equestria): It's a cross-over. Don't you hate those? Stealing from one work wasn't enough, this person had to steal from multiple works! Well actually, it's an epic story about an idealistic protagonist facing evil in a world that has stopped caring a long time ago and then has to face the consequences. It also does a good job of playing the good-ol' heart strings.
* [My Little Dashie](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/1888/my-little-dashie): Ok, at least a self-insert fanfic is by definition bad, right? Nope, it's just a very sad story about losing a person you care very much about.

But even if for whatever reason by percentage there are more bad fanfic's than bad original works: *et alors*? That still doesn't justify considering all fanfics to be bad. Most rational people don't think all black people are criminals just because they're statistically more likely to end up in prison.

**Fanfic's are detrimental for the original work/author.**

I really don't see how this is supposed to work. I can't see how fan fiction would hurt the author of the original work. I don't think anyone would ever think ""*Well, i've read this fanfic, so now i no longer have a reason to read/watch/look at the original work.*"" If anything, i image fanfic's have the opposite effect: They serve as free advertising for the original work. For example: I started watching MLP after reading [Better Living Through Science and Ponies](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/22535/better-living-through-science-and-ponies).

I can't see how it would be detrimental to the original work either. My enjoyment of MLP isn't lessened because [clopfic's](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=clopfic&amp;defid=5733129) (basically rule 34 for ponies) exist. I know they exist. I haven't read any. My life is generally not affected by their existence. You might say it's similar to the star wars prequels in that you think differently about the original because of the fanfic, but nobody forced to read that fanfic. It's not canon, so it was completely your own decision to read that fanfic. If you read a ship fic and now you can't ever look at those two characters the same way anymore, well then why did you read it?

**Fanfic's are not original and therefore inferior by definition.**

I just don't understand this argument at all. Fanfic's have original plots and often original setting and characters. What's the problem? No work is born out of a vacuum. [All works borrow from previous works](http://everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series/). The only difference is that fanfic's borrow more and that the borrowing is more obvious.

So that is my position. However, if i'm confronted with a convincing argument, i will gladly CMV.

We witness clinically sane people commit horrible crimes all of the time. Stalin starved millions of people to death for the sake of his own power, yet no one classifies him as psychotic. 

You may have seen the show 'Wilfred'. In this show the main character essentially has schizophrenia and talks to his neighbors dog. Many times his companion helps him sort out personal dilemmas and leads him to happiness. Although the main character does commit a few crimes, I believe that he is in a better state with his visions.  Although Wilfred is a work of fiction, it is a very plausible situation. 

So my question is, what gives us (the majority) the right to imprison and change the personalities and identities of anyone with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or other mental states which we deem to be wrong? Why do we treat these people as secondary citizens?"	4	25

CMV	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/20ze8b/i_believe_armenian_genocide_is_a_propaganda/	"First of all, I'm Turkish as one may figure out easily. And I really want to understand the Armenian Genocide from the other perspective, since many people other than Armenians also hold the belief that Turkey Republic should recognize the events too.

Here's a few things to acknowledge before I explain why I hold my belief:

1) I know many Armenians died in that period by the Ottoman Empire.

2) I know since Turkey republic is the successor state of the Ottoman Empire, they should be accountable.

So, why do I believe Armenian Genocide is only a propaganda material against the Turkey Republic? Because whenever the events got mentioned (in the internet mostly), things get out of proportion and many of the facts get left out.

* Armenian Resistances happened frequently, after the French Revolution especially. Thing to note is Armenians are not the only minority people who were resisting against Ottoman Empire. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_Wars)

* These resistances were commonly violent, and also violently suppressed.

* During the WW1, which Ottoman Empire was being invaded by the superpowers of the era, Britain, France, and Russia; Armenian Forces aided Russian and French with their invasion (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_resistance_during_the_Armenian_Genocide#Forces).

* There were a lot of Armenian civilians volunteered for army, most of which are killed in conflicts.

* Because of the Bolshevik Revolution, Russian Forces had to back out from war early, leaving the Armenian Forces by themselves.

* Since it was a wartime, food was scarce and there were many starvations to death from both sides.

* Many Armenian civilians were deported from their homeland as a security precaution by Ottoman Empire. Many civilians among them died during the travel.

* And lastly, yes there were crime acts by Ottoman Empire, pillaging the Armenian villages. Though another thing to note is, Muslim villages were raided by Armenian Resistance too, to a lesser extent. These are shameful acts, never could be condoned in any way, but it happens in even the modern wars of today.

Considering all these events, I think Armenian Genocide is a propaganda to gain a upper hand on Turkey Republic, because it only focuses on a very specific part of a huge scaled world war. Never mentioned that it was wartime, Ottomans had a way more civilian casualty(near 3 million-&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_casualties_of_World_War_I) by the hands of different nations, and they had to do whatever they can to save their lands(these included extreme actions like deporting the Armenians).

Really CMV, because if I'm wrong, I would love to hear. And lastly, I want to say as a Turkish guy, I'm really sorry for the Armenian deaths, I don't want to sound insensitive. It just that among all the wartime acts whole world history has, this one is brought frequently with all the information absent.

Edit: I don't know who downvotes the thread without even leaving an explanation, but that doesn't help anything guys.

I believe that despite it's analogue nature, vinyl is inherently lower in quality that reasonable-to-high quality digital recordings (256kbps MP3s as the low bar, Lossless as the high bar).

I believe this because I think:

1. The maximum quality of the recording you hear is a union of the manufacturing process of the record, and your listening equipment.
2. You don't listen to vinyl in a vacuum, therefore there's a huge amount of variance based on the players themselves which negates any quality argument.
3. The ""warmth"" of a record can be trivially replicated with filters and effects - it's a side effect, not an attribute of the format.
4. Any arguments that you can detect the ""analogue-ness"" of the sound is irrelevant to human ears with our generally poor frequency response range.
5. The only thing ""lost"" is a big picture, but we've long replaced artwork with music videos and other forms of interacting with music and artists.

As a result, I feel that the only reasons people now purchase vinyl is to participate in some kind of exclusive elitest club, in a world where music has infinite availability. As a result I think the medium of transport itself is entirely irrelevant and has no inherent value.

I think vinyl sucks! CMV!

____

Edit: Summary so far;

Value 1. I suppose by definition nobody is entitled to someone else's enjoyment of an experience .'. if the experience gives someone joy, that in itself is enough, even if I feel the experience is valueless to me.

Thus - ""Vinyl can be seen as valuable because people think it's valuable. The enjoyment of experience is enough"".

I still have no feelings towards the format whatsoever, but the argument that ""hobbies and collections are valuable by default to the person that does them"" is credible.

A dedicated PvE raider is going to spend multiple hours a week preparing for the upcoming raids (via farming, etc), and then spend HUGE swaths of time actually raiding. The PvP stats become a mandate to play EVEN MORE so that you can actually experience the game you already pay for. 

2) Often times the impact is much more extreme going from PvE -&gt; PvP and much less harsh going from PvP -&gt; PvE. By this I mean that a fully geared PvPer is going to be able to at the very least ""play ball"" in a PvE raid. But the same is basically untrue in reverse.

3) I anticipate players saying that the PvE player will have 0 experience with PvP and they do not deserve to have an advantage over someone who focus's on PvP. My response to that is ""Isn't that what ELO is for?"" These raiders have put in countless hours improving their character just to get crapped on via an arbitrary stat. Not because they arent good at it. 

4) I feel that all characters should have their gear normalized to exactly the same stats while PvPing, or a new system needs to be created. Perhaps they could implement some LoL style game play, where you join a bg at ""level 1"" and as you progress through the game, you can unlock items/buffs/stats.

EDIT 1: I am obviously a PvE raider. But I really really would love to be mildly viable in PvP too. Cant we all have fun?!

Also note that I am not talking about any religion in particular, but rather, religious thought and practice as a whole.**
_____
I think that religion and science are fundamentally opposite ways of creating meaning, discovering *truths* and satiating hunger for knowledge. This is because each starts from a different base and uses different methods to get to their conclusions, and the conclusions reached have different applications and properties.

Religion:

* Religion is founded on an assumption, and every conclusion reached is informed by that assumption (an assumption that is rarely challenged as a whole). 
* Any conclusion reached through religion is subjective and not transferable between people. One person's conclusion can inform someone else, but any person's final conclusion is their own (unless they are being intellectually dominated by someone else, in which case, it does not qualify as religions thought so much as brainwashing)
* Religious conclusions have no varifyable predictive power, they are chiefly used to guide thought, not understand objective reality (just think about how many people have falsely predicted the end of the world though studies of religious scripture). 
* Religion is mainly prescriptive, telling people how to be, rather than explaining how they are. There are rules about what you can eat, who you can marry, what is good/bad and when you can/will do certain things. These rules are made, not discovered.

Science:

* Science is founded on a method, and within science, everything is questioned. The challenging of assumptions is encouraged. 
* A conclusion reached through proper application of the scientific method is universally accepted within science (assuming there isn't another equally viable hypothosis). Any amendment of these conclusions is through the realization of aspects of the original conclusion that do not follow the scientific method properly, or the discovery of new information that puts the conclusion in doubt.
* Scientific conclusions always contain predictive power. If they do not, they are not accepted by the scientific community.
* Science is mainly descriptive, telling people how things are, rather than how to be. If some scientific knowledge is in contradiction with an observable event or has no observable proof, it will be heavily scrutinized and often disregarded. This is not so with religion where there is rarely observable proof and often contradictions with observations.

I don't mean to argue one is better than the other, or that they can't work well in harmony, but I think it is pretty clear that they are in fact opposite ways of looking at and interpreting the world.

*I'd be very happy if you could point me to some scholarly articles about the topic, as I've had a hard time finding any.*

The following reasons why I think it would be great:

* [Mosquitoes have killed more humans in history than all of the wars combined](http://www.idph.state.il.us/envhealth/pcmosquitoes.htm)

* Mosquitoes ruin my camping experience.

* They are annoying. 

[Here](http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100721/full/466432a.html) is some evidence to suggest that eradicating mosquitoes would have no consequences to the ecosystem. It seems that many animals could get along just fine without them as a food source. They are a pestilence on this earth and offer nothing of use. They need to go.

The only argument that I can think of that refutes mine is that I read an article that suggested that some bird species rely on them for food (I couldn't find it for the life of me), or that perhaps there is some future unseen use for them that we don't know about, and maybe they have the cure for cancer in them somewhere or something and if we wiped them out it would be a huge mistake.  

Still, if I could go camping mosquito free that would be awesome, and worth the risk. CMV.

The fact that many votes - especially on ""hot button"" issues - are 5-4 votes indicates that the Justices are deciding politically, rather than simply interpreting the Constitution"	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/222civ/cmvif_supreme_court_justices_actually_did_what/	"[This](http://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2012/06/01/so-much-for-politics-more-than-half-of-supreme-court-decisions-unanimous/) is somewhat dated information, but it generally speaks to my point.  Even though that article's overall view counters my view, it states:

&gt; With 58 decisions in so far, 30, or 52%, have been 9-0 votes, well above the 30% in 2007 and the five-year average of 39% for unanimous opinions. Another 12% were 8-1, compared with a five-year average of 10%. In all, 87% of the decisions so far have garnered more consensus than the 5-4 split usually associated with conservative decisions in the court run by Chief Justice John Roberts. The five-year average for 5-4 votes is 24%.

While the Constitution is certainly an ambiguous document if you're looking for ambiguity, it isn't really that complex and is generally straight forward.  And it should be especially straight forward to the greatest legal minds in the country (if we are able to assume that that group includes the Supreme Court Justices).

So, if all the Justices are doing is interpreting the Constitution and telling us what it means, there should be very little dissension.  Virtually every vote should be 9-0, with a few 8-1 decisions thrown in.  A 5-4 decision should be virtually unheard of.

Having so many votes that are *not* 9-0, indicates that the Justices are either (a) not very good at interpreting the Constitution (i.e., they aren't really qualified for the job) or (b) they are basing their votes upon their own personal and/or political opinions, rather than an interpretation of the Constitution."	1063	353

Animals rape each other left and right all throughout the animal kingdom.

Sure you could argue consent, but this assumes that people *don't need* to consent a person being gay around other people. By a man dressing in revealing women's clothing, and acting unexpectedly, this person is imposing a great deal of risk on my safety or well-being. How do I know that the guy in drag passing me on the street isn't going to do something unexpected to me?

These are all valid concerns, but most importantly, both examples I have provided are governed by the same laws.

From http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ethics-everyone/201202/parents-children-and-biological-ties

&gt; However, there is something to be said about the value of biology in the parent-child relationship. In the past, I've been much more skeptical that it had much if any value, but a paper by contemporary philosopher J. David Velleman has led me to reconsider my views. Velleman's argument can be summed up as follows:

&gt; 1. Parents have an obligation to foster identity-formation in their children.

&gt; 2. Knowing one's biological parents yields self-knowledge that has significant and irreplaceable value with respect to such identity-formation. Therefore,

&gt; 3. It is immoral to intentionally create children that will not know both of their biological parents.

Therefore parents should not be able to voluntarily give up their parental rights and adopt out their child.

Parents should not lose child custody just because they have been convicted of rape. To lose custody the parent needs to be shown a danger to the child.

Child custody should by default be joint custody. And parents should be required to share physical custody and not just pay child support.

Also, creating children by sperm or egg donation should not be allowed, [Why Sperm Donation is Bad for Dads and Kids](http://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2013/02/7571/)

Since children need both a mother and father, then homosexual couples should not be allowed to adopt, [Expert: Same-Sex Adoption Harms Children](http://www.womenofgrace.com/blog/?p=10662)

Some people might think about certain aspects of the question, others about other aspects. This is why the specificity of the question is important, otherwise you can have a whole bunch of answers all being right, but all considering different aspects, in essence all answering different things.

In politics for instance, the only way there can be more than one right answer is if the question is not specific enough and the two are considering completely different aspects of the question (for example: ethical aspects only vs economic aspects only). That is why it's so important that the question is specific enough so that a true right answer can emerge.

But for a TRULY specific question, only ONE answer can be right.
And sometimes answers to questions change, as more evidence is gathered and the problem is better understood. But it doesn't mean there is more than one correct answer, it just means our previous answer was wrong. Also, some people might have different pieces of evidence, and thus different answers. This again doesn't mean both are correct, it means neither is considering the whole picture and in the end only one answer can prevail, perhaps neither answer can prevail and a new one is formed.

Of course people can say the same thing in different ways, languages, etc. That is still the same only right answer.

The scientific world keeps track of numerical precision through a system called ""significant figures"". Some classes beat students senseless with this system. I was in one such class.

My school recently adopted a policy that the first unit of every science course has to be about metrics and significant figures. If you're not familiar with Significant Figures, here's a basic summary:

* All non-zero digits are significant.
* Trailing zeros in an integer (no decimal place) measurement are just place holders and are not significant.
* Leading zeros are also place holders and aren't significant.
* Trailing zeros following the decimal point and zeros between digits are significant.
* In scientific notation, all digits before the multiplication sign are significant.

All measured numbers have a certain number of ""significant"" digits. Numbers with more ""significant"" digits are said to be more precise. This seems idiotic to me. I understand that precision itself is an extremely thing to keep track of, but as far as I can tell, this system is flawed. I will try to articulate why I believe this through a typical use case.

A student takes out a yardstick that is equally precise with all numbers. That is, any  measurement taken with this stick is exactly as precise as any other measurement. This student measures a 1-inch long paper clip. Then, he or she measures a 12-inch long textbook. It seems obvious to me that since these two measurements were done with the same yardstick, they are equally precise. But according to Significant Figures, the textbook measurement is more precise than the paperclip measurement! It baffles my mind that this is the case.

No one has explained to me how it is fair that a double-digit number is nearly always inherently more precise than single-digit number. It's totally possible that this is a problem with my scientific education, and if that's the case, please enlighten me.

EDIT: View has been changed. Thanks everyone.

changemyview	t3_24alf9	https://www.reddit.com//r/changemyview/comments/24alf9/cmv_meateating_is_only_right_when_the_human/	2014-04-29 17:48:41	negroyverde	CMV: Meat-eating is only right when the human eating the meat has a strong sense of context and identity with the ecosystem that produced the meat. (For this reason, roadkill is a morally superior food.)	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/24alf9/cmv_meateating_is_only_right_when_the_human/	"I type this to you over some venison jerky that came from a deer found on MA route 116 several weeks ago. I should preface this by saying that I began my journey to roadkill eating via veganism, defined here as:

&gt;""Veganism is a way of living that seeks to exclude, as far as possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing and any other purpose."" - The Vegan Society (taken from /r/vegan sidebar)

By this definition, I am still a vegan (I still wouldn't eat domesticated, confined, or factory-farmed anything). Yet over time, I began thinking that a lot of the anti-vegan arguments surrounding plants were - although structurally misguided - legitimate in some way. Obviously, if you care about plants, eating plant-based foods kills fewer plants than eating animal-based foods, through which there is ""waste"" in the manure, bones, heat, etc. But the core idea around this - that soybean monoculture, or for that matter, almost any conventionally farmed crop, is not only cruel to wild animals (by destroying habitat), it relies on horrid labor practices, neoliberal economic policies that are more concerned with ""development"" than the right to self-determination of peoples of the global south, deforestation, topsoil loss, and huge profits for generally parasitic agribiz corporate officers. 

Comparing, then, the conventional (including conventional ""organic"") tofu or tempeh to the deer who was tragically killed on the highway, we find that to consume the deer is to avoid all the morally negative ecological and social damage of industrial capitalist monoculture. To consume this deer is to channel tragedy into life. It is a rebirth of the deer within your own flesh. It creates a relationship between the human and the ecosystem within which you and the animal lived. It teaches us respect - there is a solemn awareness that you become awash with when you skin an animal, clean it, butcher it, and preserve it. **The first time I processed a downed animal on the highway, I felt ""awake"" to the gravity of what it means to find sustenance in the flesh of a formerly sentient being.** I do not think anyone could engage in this activity and not feel a profound shift in their understanding of nonhuman animal use and politics.

All of this is missed when humans eat flesh that grew in a place they never saw, was killed, butchered, packaged, and sometimes even cooked in far-off, often unimaginable industrial settings. No learning happens in cultures that rely on this form of flesh consumption. Our children eat mechanically-separated chicken, sometimes without ever seeing a single live chicken, let alone entering the body of one with a blade, and being taught how to change the animal's body from that of *a chicken* to *chicken*. This is morally reprehensible, irresponsible, and does nothing but stroke anthropocentric, ""the-nonhuman-world-owes-me"" tendencies in society and in individuals. These might translate into the callousness many western humans carry towards the natural world. 

**To those who will inevitably offer the counter argument of ""if everyone did this, there wouldn't be enough roadkill.""** and similar counterarguments: It is true that I'd rather see a world where no one was hit by cars, regardless of their species. Even if this world does not come, the amount of roadkill currently produced by highways worldwide doesn't match up to the consumption of meat worldwide (though the amount of roadkill is probably enormous). This is largely because *we consume way more meat than we really should*, especially the folks who live entirely sedentary lives (most westerners).

Even still, at some point, it is very likely that, even with reduced levels of consumption, at some point, roadkill just wouldn't be enough. To that, note the section above where I said that processing a downed animal almost ""woke me up"" to the realities of eating the flesh of another. I'd argue that if a large cultural shift occurred where many people began eating (and processing/preserving) roadkill, many, many people would begin to grasp the realities of animal consumption in full, and a picture of how warped our consumption habits surrounding nonhuman animals would form. This would lead many to take action against the paradigm of domesticated and industrial flesh consumption and towards a healthier way of organizing human subsistence. 

This shift could lead towards the mobilization of larger sections of the human population to create more wilderness preserves, where wild populations of nonhuman animals could freely live. Context, I've been saying, is important, so outside of roadkill, this means for me that hunting is acceptable only when the hunter does the following:

1). Hunts only with tools fabricated by hand from local materials

2). Identifies with the ecosystem in which she hunts directly; seeing herself as a part of that ecosystem, and carries herself with a willingness to defend that ecosystem against industrial/market human aggression to the death

3). Takes great care not to over-harvest

4). Sees to it that the processing of the flesh becomes a community learning opportunity, and that the flesh stays within the community it was hunted in. 

Obviously, this means that urban areas would be largely meat deserts, but to have that conversation is to engage in commentary on the moral nature of cities (maybe I'll have a CMV about cities) which is beyond the scope of this topic. 

Thanks for reading. If you want information on roadkill processing, feel free to message me. 

Oh, and to folks who'll bring up safety objections, it seems reasonable to me only to harvest roadkill that is relatively fresh. Over time, you get really good at gauging this sort of thing. Pre-rigor-mortis, no serious internal rupturing, still warm, that's a thumbs-up. And definitely no roadkill tar-tars or rare venison steaks - I stew this stuff for a couple hours and cut it small.

However, it seems to me as though the training processes for candidates involve breaking their willpower and independence to an extent that is not necessary (or even beneficial) for military to function. The idea is to stop soldiers from defying orders, as far as I can tell, but instead it goes so far as to stop soldiers from even *questioning* orders. Drill sergeants punish candidates for thinking logically, especially if they do it out loud.

I think our society pretends that ""not knowing when to shut your mouth"" - i.e., speaking your beliefs even when it's inconvenient or troublesome - is a flaw. In actuality, it's a trait that most very successful (self-made) people in the developed world share, and it's the most ethically upstanding option. Forcing soldiers to learn when to ""shut their mouths"" apart from an immediate emergency situation can only be detrimental, especially when they go home and have to re-integrate into society. It decreases the strategic thinking capability of the military by suppressing the vast majority of its minds, and even promotes a form of escapism.

I think less of people who abuse drugs. This includes daily meth users to twice a year marijuana users and even cigarette smokers. I don't include caffeine or alcohol in here because those can have literally no negative health effects when used in moderation. Everything else I can immediately think of that would be categorized as a drug does have a negative health effect, even after one use. And I can't understand why or justify why anyone would want to use a substance knowing beyond and reasonable doubt that it has been scientifically proven to have negative effects on the body. 

I know it has been argued that it's for the relaxation effects, that sometimes people get stressed out or some shit like that and they use to help relax themselves. I think that's a load of crap. I'm a firefighter and a a paramedic, I've seen dead children, adults, elderly, mutilated people screaming for help, I've held a guy's guts in his body with my own hands, and not a thing I've experienced has ever made me feel like I needed a substance to help me be able to deal with it. I believe there are very few people in the world who have as much real stress on them as a first responder, a combatant soldier, and such. So I can't justify the stress excuse. 

I know it has been argued that it ""feels good"", but again, I cannot understand or justify how anything that is known scientifically to be detrimental to your health would ever ""feel good"" enough to knowingly want to use it. 

But I realize that I only know my own side of the story, and I want to give the other side a fair chance. So please, change my view.

*Edit:* Per a mod's recommendation, I'd like to elaborate on the alcohol and caffeine remark. It's a well established fact that caffeine is a stimulant, and that it works primarily by acting as an antagonist to adenosine receptors in the brain. However, it does not permanently bind to these receptors, or shut them down/block their pathways. The largest arguable consequence of caffeine is the cardiovascular effects, which is where my moderation comment applies. One cup of coffee will have a mild antagonist effect on your cardiovascular system which will cause literally no detrimental effects in the standard healthy individual. 

As for alcohol, the same principal applies. In a small moderated quantity, the body is more than suited to handle alcohol between the liver's ability to filter it and the brain's cognizant abilities not having any noticeable necrosis or permanent degradation. Again, that is within moderation. 

*Edit 2:* Sorry for the long wait for responses. I'm on my phone, takes considerably longer to type on. I'm trying to get back to everyone though. Thanks for the replies I am getting, I appreciate the actual discussion. "	7	48

This is about MY specific view. Things that could change his view might not change mine. and 2. I don't feel like he gave out enough points for people to actually challenge his view. I hope to not make the same mistake. 
_________

So, my view is that circumcision is cruel and pointless, and should only be done on consenting adults. Parents should not have the right to make such a decision for them. (Again, please realize I am not talking about medical reasons for circumcision. If the baby was born with medical disorder that requires it, that would be fine. But most of the time, this is not the case.)

The foreskin has many important functions. 

* Just as the eyelid protects the eye, the foreskin protects the glans, keeping its surface soft, moist, warm and sensitive. Every time I watch porn and see a circumcised penis, I cringe. It almost always looks dried up and gross. It doesn't look healthy. The foreskin also maintains optimal warmth, pH balance, and cleanliness. The glans itself contains no sebaceous glands – glands that produce the moisturizing oil that our skin needs to stay healthy. (Hyman AB, Brownstein MH. Tyson's ""Glands"": ectopic sebaceous glands and papillomatosis penis. Arch Dermatol 1969 Jan;99(1):31-6.)

* [Foreskin is a specialist tissue that is packed with nerves and contains stretch receptors.](http://books.google.com/books?id=-cqlAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA120#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) 

* The presence of foreskin makes sexual penetration easier. [Source1](http://www.cirp.org/library/general/widdicombe/), [Source 2](http://www.cirp.org/news/1966.07_Foley/), [Source 3](http://www.cirp.org/library/general/morgan2/)

* [Foreskin provides a 'gliding action' during intercourse](http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/lakshmanan/), which helps to [reduce the effects of vaginal dryness](http://www.cirp.org/library/general/warren2/), and reduces friction.""

* [Stores, releases and helps distribute natural lubricants \(""smegma"" and pre-ejaculatory fluid\)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smegma)

* In infancy, protects the urethra against contamination

* Holds M&amp;M's to sneak into the movie theatre. 

There are many other functions of the foreskin, of which you can find with a simple google search. 

Some other reasons I think circumcision is wrong when performed on healthy babies:


* [Circumcision increases infant mortality because some babies die from complications of circumcision.](http://www.cirp.org/library/general/baker1/) 

* The removal of the foreskin can lead to trauma of the penis during masturbation due to the loss of the gliding action of the foreskin and greater friction, requiring the need of artificial lubrication. 

*  [During sex, the loss of gliding action is also thought to cause pain, dryness and trauma of the vagina. The trauma and abrasions of the vagina can lead to easier entry of sexually transmitted diseases.](http://books.google.com/books?id=-cqlAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA120#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)

* [Some studies have showed that the loss of foreskin resulted in decreased masturbatory pleasure and sexual enjoyment.](http://www.mgmbill.org/kimpangstudy.pdf) 

* The foreskin is present in the genitalia of both sexes and likely has been present for millions of years of evolution. (Martin, Robert D. (1990). Primate Origins and Evolution: A Phylogenetic Reconstruction. New Jersey: Princeton University Press.)


Counter Arguments that I will probably come across:

""The American Academy of Pediatrics supports circumcision.""

The idea that the AAP and AMA are immune to cultural bias is just not consistent with reality. For example, the AMA just in 2009 changed its long-held DEA style position on the use of Marijuana despite the complete lack of supportive, clinical evidence. Also, the AAP probably isn't the best place to look for ethical advice on the subject of circumcision. In 2010, as a result of widespread condemnation, the AAP revised its previous statement that supported physicians in performing a form of female genital mutilation on certain immigrant groups.Furthermore, apart from the US, there are many respectable medical organizations that caution against or outright reject the practice of neonatal circumcision. Those organizations include: The Canadian Pediatric Society, The Nordic Ombudsmen for Children, The Royal Dutch Medical Association, The Royal Australasian College of Physicians, and The Nordic Association for Clinical Sexology.

""Circumcision helps to reduce penile cancer risk.""

The only logical way I see that it does reduce risk, is because there is less penile tissue that could develop cancer. And even then, who could justify circumcising 100,000 male infants to *possibly* prevent 1 cancer of the penis in an older man? And of course, given the risk of death / other complications of circumcision, several infants would die or have to live with severe problems just to prevent this *one* cancer. On top of all of this, if our solution to preventing and reducing the risk of cancer is by cutting off (part of) that body part, then we should remove all infant female breasts. That would prevent much more cancer. 

""Circumcision helps prevent urinary tract infections""

Even if circumcision did prevent urinary tract infection, we would have to do 100 circumcisions to possibly prevent 1 *treatable* urinary tract infection.

I would post more, but this seems sufficient to start with. I'm tired of typing. I will probably add more to this later, or edit any arguments proved null. 

edit: This is probably the first CMV I've posted that hasn't had the view challenged in the first hour its been up. Getting a decent amount of down votes though! xD Someone get the ball rolling.

 First of all, it is free from abuse. If someone follows the steps exactly, they will always end up making a right choice, whereas most other systems (especially utilitarianism) allows for some easy tweaks that can justify terrible things. 

Second, it balances subjectivity with objectivity. A rational actor does not need to sacrifice their humanity to follow through with this system. An actor is kept in line with perfect duty, but is allowed personal freedom to live as they see fit with imperfect duty.

Third, it is efficient. It has a clear and specific algorithm for deciding a moral value that can be easily and quickly deployed in the moment of decision. It does not deal with nebulous subjective values  that cannot be measured, such as pleasure or good done.


Note: I do not believe it is ethical to lie under any circumstance, so bringing up the Nazi analogy will have limited mileage.

 If the pain, suffering and lack of hope is so unbearable, one should have the right to end his or her own life, being it by himself/herself or by asking someone else to do it.

 For example, my country sends to jail everyone who fails a suicide attempt, which I think is ridiculous for obvious reasons.
And if the person isn't able to do it on his/her own, asking someone to do it, either by ending her life through ""direct"" methods such as a painless poisoning or by ""indirect"" methods such as turning off the machine that keep that person's heart beating.

I think though that it is still wrong to borrow money at Canadian citizens expense and spend that money in a way that doesnt impact our economy so we can pay it back, especially since we're already so far down the debt hole.

They are the following:

* Behavior during time served
* Ability to re-establish a life outside of prison
* Progress that has been made within the prison (education, trade skills)
* Admitting guilt, repenting, and finding a higher power.

The last item is where I have the primary issue as it appears to be based on a fact-less claim that those whom follow religion have a lower rate of crime. It appears to me to be a breach of separation of church and state to provide an unfair early release to those who subscribe to these beliefs. Further it seems that those who are more outspoken about their religion tend to be treated much more favorable than someone who openly stated they did not subscribe to any religion.

This is something that is extremely personal and hits close to home. I was chubby/fat for pretty much entire life until university, when I met a friend who happened to be your typical gym douche and... turned it all around.

He was very much into fat shaming and had no mercy towards people who say ""I can't lose weight."" And I told him on quite a few occasions that it's honestly hard for people to lose weight and all sorts of crap about metabolic rate and how some people's bodies ""want"" to be a certain size.

Well since he's also an amateur bodybuilder, he was bulking at the time. And one day, he lamented his abs disappearing and hitting almost 80kg. I had no abs, and I was almost 80kg, I actually had a very similar shape to him at that stage.

And of course, he went on to talk about how it doesn't matter since after he cut down to 70kg, it'll all be worth it. And I thought, well fuck, I might as well give it a shot no? If I just copied him, how badly can it go wrong?

Lo and behold, I dropped 10kg in time for summer, I felt better than I ever had before, for the first time I felt like I was truly fulfilling my body's potential. I've even been hit on a number of times after that, damn!

And here's where everything went downhill.

I more or less hopped on the fate shaming bandwagon. I think the problem was that losing weight once I had the right tools and mindset was ridiculously easy. And it's easy to turn around say ""look at these pathetic people complaining about it being hard, hah!""

I see fat people trying to wear nice clothes and laugh silently at how futile it is. I see them in the gym and feel queasy about how weak they are. i see fat people talk about food/exercise/healthy living and I want to shoot myself.

I almost always catch myself though and remind myself of where I had been, and not to be an asshole because there are lots of people who are where I was. But it gets harder and harder with time.

The more I hear fat people talk about ""but my genetics...."", ""my metabolism...."", ""I have a thyroid condition...."", ""I ate salad for two months but..."", or such excuses, it makes me mad with rage. And then there's the times when I hear ""But I don't want to look so bulky and disgusting with muscles"" or ""Running makes my ankles/calves hurt!"" I honestly want to punch these people in the face. Just bringing it up makes my blood boil so I think I'll stop myself here.

I don't want to turn into a completely apathetic asshole and completely demonise fat people, but the more time that pass, the more I seem to be OK with that. The more time that pass, the more I see fat people who talk about their health as abominations akin to corrupt politicians talk about idealisms, the less I see them as people, the more I wish they would just give up going outside.

This is definitely not a healthy train of thought and it terrifies me that I can think this way, I need to change but I can't help being disgusted/disenchanted/disturbed by fat.

**tldr:** Please convince me to not hate fat people.

They may download and listen to it, but in a few weeks, they will probably forget about all the music they thought was so amazing just a short while ago. However music like Led Zepplin, or David Bowie will probably still be listened to in another fifty years, even though no one listening will have lived through the artist's career. The fact that modern music is forgotten and replaced so quickly, clearly highlights that it is worse it predecessors.

I believe that if said pop music 'fans' were exposed to more music, you would find they all have specific tastes, and would then grow a disdain towards their previous musical taste. 

For example, people who listen to whatever mainstream rap, like Eminem, but they never seek out any other artists, and just listen to Eminem's new hit songs when they come out. Their musical taste never evolves and so they continue to support mediocre artists. They may find that they prefer different styles of rap, or maybe grunge or punk or whatever.

Why is this bad? Well as I just alluded to, I feel that this musical taste, or lack there of, is just perpetuating the rise in popularity of bad musicians. It is somewhat clear that 'image' and 'charisma' are valued more today than vocal ability or musical talent (or maybe the ratio is a lot more skewed than it once was). People are at the top of the charts as they appeal to people that dont care about music enough to pursue different genres.  If people actually sought out musicians they 'genuinely' liked, then they would support a variety of styles, and improve the music industry vastly. So not only do these people 'cheat themselves', but they also 'cheat' out everyone else.

Different protocols perform differently, and enhancing the performance of some is already undermining total neutrality. Yet it might be important to do so. 

Should people be able to pay for extra infrastructure? I think they should, but in a way - this undermines net neutrality by giving some people an advantage in how data is served. 

There are many more reasons, but here are just two. 

Now I don't think this means that net neutrality is a useless concept - far from it. 

I don't think ISP's should be able to throttle, for example - and if someone pays for their customers to get better service - it shouldn't come at the cost of other players who don't pay. 

At the end of the day - I think that I think the important issue is what service providers and companies which serve content should be able to do and what they should not - and the devil is in the details. 

Total net neutrality is impossible.

I have both been working for East Indians as well as interviewing with them. My experience has been that they are utterly corrupt people who have no morals, driven purely on profit.

My experience has included predatory interview practices where  I was asked questions about my citizenship, whether I was living alone in the city/country (i am a visible minority).

I also worked for an East Indian guy who did very questionable moral things such as taking charity money that were donated in the name of helping children. There was also nickel diming and practices which were detrimental to the wellbeing of his clients.

As a result of these experiences, I am fearful of dealing with them in business, as I have recently moved from being a working joe to a small business owner, since I cannot trust for them to either work for me or work with me.

I should mention that prior to these experiences, I rejected these ideas as bigoted and racist."	0	66

The authors of said webcomic are staunch libertarians and believers in the NAP.  In the comic, there are androids with artificial intelligence.  The more enlightened societies in the comic give androids full rights under the NAP.  

I don't think this is very well thought out.  The NAP, like most other legal philosophies, is designed for individuals.  It requires individual sovereignty, individual accountability.

AIs could do two things humans usually can't.  They can copy themselves, mind and body, and they can be reprogrammed.  These factors make individuality very ambiguous.  Where does one individual end and another begin?

How much can an AI be altered before it becomes a new person?  If you kill an AI, but a backup copy exists, is it murder?  If an AI is duplicated by accident or maliciously, which copy owns the property of the original? 

None of these are questions anyone is prepared to answer.  If humans gain the ability to copy and reprogram ourselves, it would also be a blow to individualism.

**EDIT:**  Let me clarify one thing.  The problem with an AI copying itself is not the that copy is not unique, it's that it becomes ambiguous whether or the obligations, crimes, and property of the original extend to the copy.  Both answers could create highly problematic situations, and adding in the possibility that AI can be reprogrammed just complicates it further.

When I say ""individuality"" I do not mean ""uniqueness"".  I mean the state of existing with a clear line of demarcation between yourself and other individuals.  Properly assigning obligations, liability for crimes, and property requires that this distinction exists.

As an example lets look at a particular policy that is, as far as I can see, a clear cut libertarian policy. Getting rid of social security and just giving people their money to invest in the stock market. Clearly this increases consumer choice, and is therefore good in the minds of libertarians. 

Lets make the assumption that the policy was enacted tomorrow. Things might go well for a while, but inevitably there would be an economic downturn, maybe a stock market crash, and a large number of old people would be out of their retirement money. This IMO would lead to a lot of angry old people, and politicians don't mess with angry old people. Don't believe me? the Republican party is the ""party of cutting government spending"" and yet they always exempt SS/Medicare from their cuts out of fear of angering old people. In the end this large group of angry old people, would get either a new version of SS or just straight up government handouts to help out, and down goes the libertarian program.

Similar situations can be thought of for other policies as well. In the end I feel like people have gotten used to government intervention to the point they will demand it, and thus it will always happen in a democratic society.

ESPN has 24/7 or whatever people going on about whats going to happen with the major teams this year, how well the new guys are going to be after they are drafted, who is going to draft them. Big game coming up? Better watch the pregame where two guys debate for over an hour what they think the outcome of the game will be. Sports are totally unpredictable (which is part of the appeal I hear,) why bother trying to figure it out beforehand, and why bother listening to those that do?

Thanks for the replies everyone!

It's just that the schools and political and economic institutions have not adapted to this reality and they have a vested interest in not acknowledging it.

They have also not adapted to the reality that there is not that much work that needs to be done, so the whole model of ""do job, get money"" is broken on a large scale.  (See: [On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs](http://strikemag.org/bullshit-jobs/))

So in order to keep a ton of people out of the labor force for extended periods of time, we have school, which acts as ""holding cells"" for the people for whom there are not enough jobs.

Teachers need jobs for money, so they have a vested interest in keeping the game going.  

Kids/people aren't allowed to do most jobs, especially not without a degree that you can only get through school even if you learn on your own, so they go along with it because they have no choice.

Politicians are beholden to the rich who like having a super well educated workforce willing to work for cheap, both in order to pay off their student loans and because they're competing against an increasingly well-educated workforce.

The people who've already been through the system have a vested interest in keeping the game going, because they had to waste their lives in the system, and they'll be damned if other people don't have to do the same.

So basically we waste the time, and minds, and lives, of generations of young people because we don't know what else to do with them and a lot of people have a vested interest in keeping the game going.  

Which isn't to say that school doesn't have some redeeming features.  Inb4 ""some or most kids are too stupid to learn on their own.""

But I think we ignore obvious truths like this out of political correctness, and if you point them out people naturally get super duper pissed off.  

In real life if you point out that the emperor lacks clothing, the emperor and everyone pretending to see otherwise decide to hate you, yell at you, and may try to kill you.

There may be other dynamics at play, but the ""school as capitalist holding cell, but we can't point that out because people get mad"" is at least one dynamic at play.  CMV.

Everything else was just rhetoric designed for popular support.	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2dcs9t/cmv_the_us_founding_fathers_were_hypocrites_and/	"The Founding Fathers were all wealthy, educated, free white men. They owned a lot of land. The whole separation between the colonies and England resulted from the new aristocracy in the Americas feeling like they weren't getting the same respect and reverence as the old aristocracy. Hence, we get the whole ""taxation without representation"" thing, which was just them bitching about the fact that they weren't being respected enough in the old aristocracy in England to be included in these important matters.

This disagreement over taxation was just symptom of an inferior complex, which tipped the balance over to full-brown and rhetoric filled fight for freedom and the England-was-evil thing we've all been taught in schools. 

But a revolution is impossible with a bunch of rich, white aristocratic men like George Washington (the richest man in America). So in order to get popular support, documents and noble sounding ideologies were thought up and immortalized in the Declaration of Independence, Constitution, Bill of Rights, etc. 

An example of rhetoric aimed at inciting popular support for an otherwise rich, white men's war is the ""All men are create equal..."" statement that's so famous today. That phrase was never meant to include any other men except the rich white men of the new aristocracy. Hence we have a few hundred more years of civil rights for blacks and women's suffrage. Hell, not all white me were included as only rich, land-owning white men have any power, never mind other races and women. 

Even after America won its independence, land, power, influence, and prestige such suffrage was only limited to a tiny minority (white land-owning men) which was problematic because back then very few white men were rich enough, unless the were tied to the old aristocracy back in England, to own any land. Most were dirt poor indentured servants, so they were as good off as blacks and women.

Events after the Revolutionary War saw the even more power in the hands of the new elites while everyone else were in the same place they were before the war. 

tl;dr The founding of the United States was an effort of the new aristocracy in the Americas to break away from the old aristocracy in England. Everything else was just a bunch of rich white men trying to get the masses to support them.

Voter ID laws are just common sense. in roughly one to two hours you can...

go to your local RMV

Apply to get an ID from the state (pretty much a drivers license just says ID on it in big red letters)

and register to vote

i did this the day i turned 18 as i lived in an area where public transportation is popular so i didn't need a license.

they gave me a temporary paper ID and a week later boom i had my nice photo ID from the state.

It seems absurd to me that we card people to get into  over 18 or over 21 shows/concerts/clubs, when they buy cigarettes, when they buy booze, and countless other examples yet when it comes to voter id laws if you support them you are in favor of ""oppressing minorities"" 

It just makes sense to make sure the people who are voting are who they say they are.  "	5	125

There was no rides - only attractions like mini golf, rock climbing, bumper boats, etc. Lines can get kind of long, but not too long. The biggest issue is that it takes awhile for people to be finished before you get your turn. Multiple times I had issues where we would wait and wait and then suddenly a group of 10 kids would run and meet their mother infront of us on line. This was completely unfair to my nephew and I. While they had the luxury of enjoying other attractions while someone held their spot, I had a small party and had to wait in each line with my nephew. 

The reason I think it's cutting is because lines should be based on how long you have waited for your turn... not when you arrived at the queue first. If a group arrives three seconds before me and then gets to go enjoy other attractions while someone holds their place, we will be waiting MUCH longer than them. Then they can come back when it's almost our turn and take up another half hour of waiting.

It also creates an unfair estimate of how long the line will be. A lot of times you gauge whether or not you will join a line by how many people are on it. If you decide to wait and the, when you're about to go, a huge group comes back and goes ahead of you, you may no longer wish to wait. Now you've just wasted your time in that line. 

I understand people have to go to the bathroom but this should be a quick detour and the surrounding people should be made aware. Of course if you're in a huge amusement park or the placeholder's party size is small it won't make much of a difference. However, in my case and many cases I think holding places in long for a long duration of time should be considered cutting. If you want to enjoy an attraction your body should physically be there waiting with everyone else. Change my view!

They have seen the [newest footage] (http://www.tmz.com/2014/09/08/ray-rice-elevator-knockout-fiancee-takes-crushing-punch-video/) They are saying things like 1) she married him after this incident actually occurred so no one should feel sorry for her. 2) she slapped him first and he has a right to hit him back 3) They were drunk so it must've been a special incident. I personally do not find any of these things to be excuses for him or makes spousal abuse any more lighthearted that it makes it ok to laugh at the situation. 1) I believe that if it is actually an abusive relationship that her marrying him makes it an even more frightening for her, not an opening to blame her for her situation. I don't find it surprising that an abused spouse could marry their abuser if they can not even find the strength to leave their abusor. 2) I do believe a person has a right to defend themselves when they are struck regardless of gender but he used enough force to knock her out, I believe that is up and beyond what right you have to defend yourself 3) Intoxication does not make the situation funny or less serious or less frequent of an incident. If it happens when they are drunk it may also happen when they are sober. These are just a few points that they laughed about, but I can not find this funny at all. They seem to feel that the situation is so minor they don't have to be serious about it. Can you argue how this situation might be funny, or silly?	0	9

(Large Post)	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2j9q64/cmv_pessimism_will_be_the_destroyer_of_humanity/	"Hello CMV! This is my first post and I hope that you guys will enlighten me to new ideas on this statement. Lets get to it! 

Now right off the bat you may be asking yourself how a single mentality could bring our species down to destruction. That is a good question, and I often asked the same thing before coming to my conclusion. The reason is because pessimism usually manifests into many other negative emotions and outlooks. These can go from depression to cynicism. In the further paragraphs I will make my stance and explain why I believe it.

**My Background (Optional Read)**

For most my life I have been the exact opposite of what I stand for today. I would always expect the worse out of everything, and would quit at any challenge I faced. This lead to a downwards spiral of me being involved in clubs and having large hobbies to me contemplating suicide everyday at the slightest misfortune. 

Along with my pessimism affected by desire to get help or to improve my current self. I would ask questions such as ""Why does it matter? I quit everything anyways."" This got so bad to the point that I would sit in my room everyday, doing absolutely nothing or planning ways to build nooses out of electric wires. Luckily I never did any of those plans, and I have the opportunity to write to you today. 

Even though those days were rough, it gave me insight to what people with pessimism actually feel like and how they behave to advice and opportunities. Now, I consider my past self to have been a extreme example of the effects of pessimism. Not everyone who has it acts that way, I am just showing how damaging this mindset can be to you as an individual. The effects that pessimism can have on you can be very damaging, though the effect it brings on society is is very daunting as well.

**A Pessimistic Society**

We live in a rapidly changing society, which all the new innovations and ideas much to our benefit and harm. The technology and science we make every day is shocking, and often makes me feel like I am living in a science fiction universe. The problem of course is the rising mentality of pessimism in many social circles.

I have in fact been a part of some of these circles who have many negative outlooks. All the talk was hating on other peoples' achievements, thinking that Humans were terrible and that the world would be better without us, and how they were so much better than any popular stereotypical group you can imagine. Right off the bat we are introduced to three effects of pessimism; narcissism, misanthropy, and jealously. Every one of these people shared the same outlook: ""Life sucks, and it isn't going to get better."" 

This didn't bother me much until a year ago when I asked myself that these people along with me are going to end up becoming the adults of the world. That mindset could be very bad for the progression of Humanity. Basically what I am going for is that for example: if many people think that medicine is pointless and there is no point in trying to improve it, the result is thousands of potentially treated diseases being untreatable.

As I started to leave the grasps of pessimism, I looked around on the internet hopping that it was only a local issue. It was the exact opposite. Around the globe were constant sighs of hopelessness. Many people making fun of Humanity and how we are doomed as a species. My friends overseas when I brought it up all had the same downcast outlook on life that my local ones did. It surprised me just how large of a opponent I stood against. 

The very fact that pessimism is so large just proves its potential of influencing the majority of us. To conclude this over-written CMV, I believe that all of the people who have pessimism will jinx themselves into bringing the world down.

changemyview	t3_2m7keb	https://www.reddit.com//r/changemyview/comments/2m7keb/cmv_anything_poetry_can_do_literature_can_do/	2014-11-13 19:50:37	ostiedetabarnac	CMV: Anything poetry can do, literature can do better.	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2m7keb/cmv_anything_poetry_can_do_literature_can_do/	"For my purposes I consider literature and novels interchangeable. There are certainly differences -- not all novels are literature, etc. -- but in the respect that they indicate long-form storytelling, contrasting with poetry's stricter and shorter format, they make up what I find superior to poetry. This is simply a disclaimer so that I don't need to use them differently.

I've often seen it put forward that novels are simply word-vomit, whereas poetry is the refinement of a carefully selected set of words. This implies a lot of things about literature that I disagree with: 1) that literature is not as refined as poetry, 2) that the standards for literature are lower than for poetry, and 3) the impact of poetry is greater than that of literature upon the reader.

Perhaps I could go through all my favourite books and point out passages that I believe are so poetic that they show literature is as refined as poetry. That wouldn't really prove anything though, because the instant response would be to bring up every part I didn't mention, for they must be less refined. This would be a fallacy; while poetry has more relatively meaningful lines, in literature the 'glue' must exist to hold all the elements of the story together. If you never wrote ""John said."" you wouldn't necessarily have a better work, just one that subverts the most common conventions of writing, something which I believe we can agree doesn't determine whether a work is good or bad, but is simply a small factor in that decision.

The standards of good writing have never been higher, for we have never had a larger selection to choose from. I don't know the poetry industry well enough to make any statements about it, but from what I've heard it's also facing the same belt-tightening that novel publishing is. Unless a given work appeals to the human side of the editors/publishers in some way there is a low chance that it will make it past the slush pile. In this one facet I can see poetry having an edge, because it is shorter and can theoretically be consumed faster, making more room for works; but at the same time, an account of the meaning within a poem could deserve twice the time of some pulp romance novels. 

Even beyond this supposed even point, standards have become more nebulous, conceptually, than they once were. Cummings (and presumably many others) brought non-grammatical writings to poetry, but is the uneducated opening of ""Flowers for Algernon"" any different? Style is entirely dictated by a number of internal and external factors that never stop changing, while the completed work is static forever afterwards. Shakespeare was once considered the king of playwrights (citation needed) but now if you took his name off the cover of a modernized version people would complain of how trite his works are. The ever-changing nature of standards makes me laugh when people say this pulp novel is qualitatively worse than that sonnet, because they tend to rely on far more judgmental assumptions than they explain. If all the world's writers and readers haven't yet come to a conclusion on what good writing is, I don't see the validity in a claim that any entire mode of writing can be superior or inferior to another.

My last problem is about the impact of a work on a reader. This is more subjective grounds than the other two, I think, and this could be the one I'm least sure of. Some people make a big point of *minimalism*, the ability to evoke from an audience with a minimum of material. Generally, poetry is more minimal than literature in every way. This is due to the general constructs which each use to evoke from the reader, where poetry uses tight prose and emphasizes imagery, while novels use narration, to build the intended mental image. But nothing about the feelings a reader feels is defined by the amount of words or metaphors it took to create them, and any limit placed thereby is a false restriction. I could argue that not having limitations of form gives literature *more* variability, that the freedom of it gives superior room for creativity, but in that sense there exists poetry that breaks those rules too (free-form). So, while literature isn't necessarily better than poetry just because of freedom of expression, poetry is certainly not better than literature because of its spartan format. 

Maybe you've read all this, and you're wondering: ""Where is the proof that literature can do it better?!"" Yes, my points have only argued that literature is not inherently worse, but this is an important part of the overarching idea. I think the strongest evidence I can present for the superiority of literature is simple. By explication all the subtlest themes of poetry can be expanded and alluded to and improved upon. Anything that is said in one sentence will be improved in every qualitative way by expansion. Nothing is ever expressed better in less words than in more. If you believe you can convince me otherwise of this, then feel free. I'd love to see more value in poetry than I already do.

tl;dr longer = more expression = better. I wrote an essay on why short works aren't better than long ones and here you are reading the summary.

(P.S.: I've got some cognitive reasons for why I think literature is better too but science is slow and it's pretty hard to argue about the 'general function' of brains when they're good enough to do anything we need anyway)

Edit: I've read every post, but there are too many things I didn't respond to. Wasn't expecting as big of a discussion to form. I'm happy though; my mind was changed in ways, I've learned a lot more perspectives on the topic than I previously had, and this is the healthiest dissection of 'value' in writing I've read in a long time. If I had infinite time I'd be responding to them all -- but I suppose, that's one of the points that changed my view, here. Thanks folks."	59	108

Most often, one of the two sides is pretty much right -- so much so that the degree to which they're wrong, in the direction of the other side's point, is trivial. In that case, arguing that the truth is 'between the two sides' is just derailing and equivocating. It's pointless resistance against the right answer during the conflict, and gives undue credibility to the losing side after the fact.

Also common: both sides are wrong, as are all the points between them. Often, the correct (or best) answer is a third position that doesn't closely resemble either position. In this case, arguing that the truth is between the two sides limits flexibility in thinking, and arguing after the fact that the correct answer represents a meeting point between the sides gives unearned credit to both wrong groups.

Also common: both sides are wrong, but one side is less wrong, and the best answer is an even more extreme version of the less wrong side, and very much not in between the two sides that are being advanced. 

[EDIT 10 p.m. EST: I'm going to bed now. I work retail Black Friday morning and I'm not sure my brain will come home with me when I get out, but I'm interested in this dialogue and if anybody wants to make points and doesn't mind if it takes a few days to get a response, I promise you won't be typing at the void.]

Jim always had his sights set on Nadya, but through the shenanigans in the movie, he instead wound up boning future wife Michelle.

Now I'm not saying that Michelle and Jim shouldn't have boned or gone on to get married and such.  I'm just saying that Jim shoulda held out for Nadya as planned.  She was definitely a worthwhile endeavor and they come back to their connection in later movies.  And the problem is that connection is never consummated because Jim is perpetually in the relationship with Michelle.  So Jim shoulda lost his virginity to Nadya foremost, then if he wanted pursued his relationship with Michelle IMHO.  "	13	8

I'm English and, shock horror, I like football. Yes I will call it football, and yes I know soccer is an English word. I could not care less about the name of the sport, it makes exactly 0 difference to my enjoyment]

Hello CMV,

I am of the opinion that the constant stream of debate on the positives/negatives of Association Football as a sport have been the biggest driver behind American's apathy towards the sport.

Nothing is worse than being told how weird or unusual you are for not liking a commonly popular thing, or being told that something is wrong with you if you don't. The American sporting fanbase has had to deal with a lot of this over the past 50 odd years with regards to football, and although this has slightly waned over ~ the past 2 World Cups, I believe it is too late, and will now never be fully ingratiated into US sporting culture (compared to the classic sports).

I believe the veiled snobbiness and general condescension from Euro football fans has contributed to this, but I also believe that the internet has created a 'Debate All Ad Nauseum' ethos which can be counterproductive to the growth of traditional hobbies/games/sports in a modern setting.

So many articles like ['Why America Doesn’t Like Soccer, And How That Can Be Changed' - Time Magazine](http://time.com/2864483/world-cup-2014-soccer-brazil-america/), [Is This Soccer's Moment in America? - WSJ](http://www.wsj.com/articles/is-this-soccers-moment-in-america-1403819659), and [Forget the World Cup Hype. America Will Never Embrace Soccer - LA Weekly](http://www.laweekly.com/informer/2014/06/30/forget-the-world-cup-hype-america-will-never-embrace-soccer) hinder a natural growth of interest in the history and traditions of football, which is a fundamental reason why the game is so popular. Who wants to be fed full of 'This could be popular because x viewer stats and # of tweets per minute of the game', and then go look at Liverpool's success in the 80's? Nobody.

Another reason is emotion. Being told to 'pick a side, pro football or anti football' creates an aura of national debate usually saved for Politics or Religion. Tarring a sport with this brush is a bad move, and does not help a casual fan from gradually falling in love with the game. It's a slow process, no-one transitions from knows-nothing to uberfan in a year. I believe a true love for a sport comes from following a team for a long period of time (thick and thin, ups and downs and all those lovely cliche) and wallowing in the success of others as a result of the time you personally have invested in a team. It's a slow and patient process.

How is the average American supposed to casually follow the Premier League, if they are constantly being told to line up on a side and either be a full blooded Hooligan or a HandEgg Loyalist? Casualism is the backbone of football. 

I admit this opinion of mine was first formed a few years ago, and since then many of my American friends have started to follow the weekend results out of habit, which is up to them. I'm not telling them they have to like it, but I wish the media would stop constantly debating whether people should or shouldn't like it, for heavens sake.

[sorry if I rambled, discovered this sub today and am in love]

A car or a paper towel has attributes than can be discussed in a commerical in a way that the consumer can understand. They use commericals to inform consumers as to why the product is a better choice than the competition by discussing what is done differently. 

Medicine is not marketed by talking about what chemicals are in it relative to the competition, rather they show clips of patients enjoying life while listing a crapload of deadly side effects. Yes it is true that many products are marketed by showing the viewer shots of a general lifestyle that does not really pertain to the product, but the difference is that medicine is far more complicated and can do far more harm to a person if purchased hastily than something like gum or a coffee machine. Yes it is also true that doctors get the final say it is only with there perscription that a purchase of medication can be authorized, so then I ask why do we need the commercial in the first place? Why not just send doctors a brochure of the latest in medication? 

There is also an arguement to be had for the ""vote with your dollar"" concept of capitalism, but in my view medicine is exempt from this because no one wants to have to buy medicine and no one who is not a doctor is qualified to say which medication is ""better"", as well as the fact that most consumers are not going to try a variety and medicines and keep buying that which they like the best as is the case with shampoo or food. To me, commercials for medicines are a shameless way for pharma companies to plug something and make money. Pharma should not be about profit, but results. The fact that the commercials are legal seem indicative of a dangerous trend of ""profit before well being"" that is present the industry. CMV!

changemyview	t3_2sjru2	https://www.reddit.com//r/changemyview/comments/2sjru2/cmv_i_believe_that_trigger_warnings_are_unhealthy/	2015-01-15 20:03:37	Mynotoar	CMV: I believe that trigger warnings are unhealthy, and institutions shouldn't tailor their content around them	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2sjru2/cmv_i_believe_that_trigger_warnings_are_unhealthy/	"Edit: I evidently haven't thought this through very much, and my argument is criticising the wrong group of people. I think the bulk of my argument is a knee-jerk reaction to Tumblr-folk who misuse the term ""trigger"" to mean being offended or not happy about a trivial thing. I recognise that this is clearly not the same thing as a genuine trigger, for someone who has been through PTSD or suffered a genuine trauma.

If people are unclear on terms, a ""trigger warning"" is a quick notice given before a speech, video, body of text etc., warning the audience that its content may trigger certain traumatic memories. For example, if a video talks about rape, it might have a trigger warning so that victims of rape can avoid it if they want to avoid painful recollections.

I don't think this is healthy, and should not be encouraged as a practice. The victim of a trauma is always, eventually, going to come across stimuli that might be ""triggering"", it's not the responsibility of society to avoid giving those stimuli. They might end up studying rape in psychology, or law, or ethics, or a variety of classes. Should the professor start his class with ""By the way, today we're going to be talking about rape, and if anyone's uncomfortable with that, you're welcome to stay out of the class""? No; there are potentially infinite possible things that could trigger a person, and a 
professor shouldn't be expected to account for all of them.

Some considerations. Firstly, if the lecturer was showing something that would reasonably upset a lot of people (violence, abuse, suicide etc,) then yes, please put a notice at the start of a class. Secondly, I think the professor in this situation should be accommodating, and if a student specifically approaches or emails him about content they find uncomfortable, then the professor ought to make accommodations within reason.

But, it's not the professor's job to foresee any possible triggering content - picture the sort of people you find on /r/TumblrInAction who are triggered by trees. I'm being silly, of course, but some people can't tolerate things that most people are perfectly okay with, and when that's the case, the person shouldn't *expect* teachers, friends and family to accommodate for them.

And if a psychology student came up to the professor in the scenario and told him she found the Millgram experiment disturbing and didn't want to see any content relating to it, then the professor is entitled to raise eyebrows as to why the student is taking the class.

I've perhaps not worded the argument very coherently, so, **tl;dr**, people with triggers shouldn't expect people to accommodate their behaviour, and should learn to deal with those stimuli.

I believe addiction is one of history's greatest scourges, and modern science offers very poor hope of recovery for many people -- and even when recovery is possible, the physical yearning will never truly cease (see the movie Pleasure Unwoven for a scientific explanation for how addiction works: http://www.amazon.com/Pleasure-Unwoven-Explanation-Disease-Addiction/dp/B003AC98V2). Therefore, I believe that when it is possible, we should physically alter peoples' brains to not have the disease of addiction.

I don't think love is a smart investment of self. No one ever anticipates being burned in love, and yet the chances are that the vast majority, and even possibly all, the relationships in your romantic life will end that way, often through no fault of your own. You can pour all of your love into someone for years and they can walk away for no other reason beyond ""not feeling it"" anymore or having met someone else. You can't control other people, you can only control yourself and your own actions. 

Knowing the brutal truth of the fact that you can't make someone fall or stay in love with you, I believe the risk and pain of being burned in love after years of sacrifice and fidelity is a worse prospect than the pain of maintaining emotional self-sufficiency, finding happiness and fulfilment with life by yourself and never having been in love.

Not so much individuals whom just prefer the dietary lifestyle. Someone I know recently finished a temp job in which they demolished last years crop fixtures to make room for this years crop fixtures (things like posts for vines to hang onto ect.) In doing so, he sited that his tank treads on his ripper would often destroy mice and gopher homes as well as killing individual mice and gophers. Now I'm not saying that vegetarian's just shouldn't eat. However, it's philosophically inconsistent to be sternly against killing animals for meat products, when animals are also killed for fruit and vegetable products. Now this isn't directed towards people who have their own private gardens they eat exclusively from, rather as the title implies people that gain their fruits and veggies from modern agricultural methods I.E. buying them at the supermarket indiscriminately.

A way to change my view, would be to challenge it on a philosophical level, as opposed to anything that is pragmatic or rooted in social or economic climates. That being said, CMV.

Free requirements, but you should at least need training. People get so mad at cops for shooting random people, then they think its totally ok for every citizen to be packing heat, and think that for some reason a bunch of untrained people with guns arent going to shoot people when they feel ""threatened"" just like cops to ALL THE TIME. If people arent trained extensively, them packing heat is going to escalate situations. I mean hell, [escalated arguments are the leading cause of homicide, above even gang violence](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expanded_homicide_data_table_10_murder_circumstances_by_relationship_2012.xls) and I see no reason why it should be considered ok, or that people should feel ""safe"" with everyone packing heat. Even if it did cut down on a few crimes, is it really going to be worth the amount of arguments that are escalated by Joe Schmoe feeling ""threatened"" and pulling out his .38? There should be extensive training before this is allowed. This lets people keep their freedom while making the situation safer. 


Edit: wow, good thing you went through and downvoted all of my posts. Really changed my viewand contributed to intelligent discussion. Im talking about a happy medium of freedom and safety, such an ignorant anti freedom idea, right? Jesus...

I mean, how could we elect a man so ignorant to office?""

This is a thought often expressed by leftist pundits and various media voices.  And it has a certain truth to it - after all, to doubt such a basic truth of biology, with so much evidence and logic behind it, suggests one is at least somewhat mentally incompetent and therefor probably unfit for office.  But then I was struck by this seeming contradiction:

The vast majority of politicians, Democrat and otherwise, say they believe in God.  Now on the face of it, that doesn't seem too insane - most Americans believe in God!  But when you really compare the two beliefs-

Belief in God - Despite a total lack of evidence, there is a magical all powerful deity that controls everything.  When we die, our invisible ghost selves join him in another dimension.

Lack of belief in evolution - It is very unlikely that ""random"", natural processes produced beings as intelligent as humans and phenomena as complex as DNA over billions of years, starting with nothing but primordial soup. 

Do you now see that belief in God suggests utter delusion but lack of belief in evolution merely demonstrates scientific ignorance?  Therefore I believe this common view as Republicans as scientifically and logically incapable compared to Democrats as very hypocritical and essentially baseless.

NOTE: I am not talking about those with cancer, HIV, stomach ulcers, schizophrenia; I think medication is more justified for these sever cases what I'm refering to is the following. There are too many pills available that give so-called ""fast relief"" from pain or discomfort like Aspirin that can be mediated by less invasive means or simply dealt with without medicaton. As some one who does study chemistry at a higher level, it saddens me to think that medications are being taken at excessive amounts for several reasons:

(1) All medications come with side effects that can have long term consequences espacially when taken frequently. There is no ""pure"" pill that binds only to the desired targets. Sure, there are medications that bind to desired target sites with higher affinities but that doesn't mean that they have zero interaction with other sites or biochemical mechanisms. So that's where the issue comes up. You really have to wiegh the pros and cons. IF YOUR ARE OVERALL HEALTHY AND NOT AT RISK then DON'T take just any medication ""because you can"". Please do not get addicted to Aspirin etc. . Sooner or later you may find that this said medication will mess up some other part of your body in the long run; which will definitely outwiegh its temporary therapeutic value.

(2) Medication interactions are often times undocumented and can lead to nasty metabolites and horrible health consequences. The key to remember is that NOT all medication interactions are documented and even when they are they are not documented for the LONG RUN consequences. The truth is that no one really totally knows at 100% accuracy how every single person on the planet will respond to a certain medication let alone a combination thereof. You are lessening your chances of bad consequences if you do not take fluoxetine, bextra and Tylenol together simply because you have chronic depression but happen to have menstrual cramps and a toothache one day. Please DON'T do that. WAIT OUT the menstrual cramps and toothache because there's a high chance both those would go away in a matter of days. 

(3) Most people are not doctors, pharmacologists, chemists nor nurses. Therefore, most people do not fully understand the mechanisms of medication and what really happens in their body when they chug down that pill. Poor decisions and ignorance regarding medication usage is more commonplace for the general population.

(4) Whatever happened to valuing pain resistance, endurance and strength? Believe it or not, avoiding all pain in life will not help you become a stronger person mentally. Adversity does breed character to one degree or another. It at least breeds resilience. How would a sheltered person deal with nuissances in life like stomachaches without medication? Probably worse thn some one who is used to taking the pain. Essentially, this makes some one dependant on medication for day to day life. How is that a good thing?

(5) If you are constantly medicating yourself you will lose the ability to identify the extent of your symptoms. You would lose the ability to determine the difference between (1) normal human pains from the (2) I need to see a doctor because my organs aren't working type of pain.

There is more I just don't have time to write.

Now, it's all tired memetics. Not to use the ""bring circlejerk back to its roots"" cliche, but yeah... it really could be a lot better than it is now. There's plenty to work with from a satirical perspective, but low-effort posts continue to abound.

**Edit:** If you can point out a subreddit that does this well, you will successfully change my view that /r/circlejerk should demonstrate more wit. (It can't just be ""kinda similar"" though - SRD and SRS are very different from what I mean.)

Source: http://iwritedealwithit.blogspot.com/2015/04/critical-thinking.html

 Critical Thinking
There is something everyone, including myself needs to do a lot more of. You can probably guess by the title. Critical thinking.

People around the world do not think critically nearly as much as they need to. You see this with mass media, war propaganda, economic policy, feminism, and simple everyday life. We don't think enough. Humans like to act and get things done, especially Americans. I can respect that, but it's leading us down roads that really screw us over.

Now first you need to learn how to critically thinking. There is no one way of doing this. You can take a class on critical thinking, I did, and I was extremely fortunate with that class. You can also read books on the subject or that challenge you or your line of thinking, that's another thing that has helped me move along. You can talk with people or just look at a news story and think it over for a moment. Use whatever works for you. Websites, books, movies, socializing, classes, really whatever, just make sure you think about the information you're getting. Don't fall into dogma or bigotry. If the argument and evident is good, reasonable, or in any way valid, give it some thought. Ponder the issue than come up with a conclusion.

To help you along, here's a few things I suggest.

1.http://rhetoric.byu.edu/
This sight is all about rhetoric which is all about thinking and coming up with reasonable arguments (this is not a definition), and I highly suggest it. There's a lot of information and it can be thick at times, so take it slow if you need to.

2. Read Plato's Protagoras and Meno
These works are excellent. Reading Socrates's arguments is like seeing wisdom in physical form. They are exquisite to read, though they are very deep and even thicker than the website above. It takes time to get them and going back and rereading is a must. I myself need to reread them to see what I missed. But if nothing else, I highly suggest these books.

We are the only species we know of, that can think critically. That can come up with logic and advance ourselves beyond simple needs. We should not allow that potential to go to waste.

My experience with ads however has been pretty terrible because webmasters often simply choose ads that provide the most income regardless of how they actually operate.  This can cause issues that range from the mildly annoying such as audio playing without my permission to the malicious FBI type that tries to extract money from you.

Adblock does a damn good job of protecting me from these things even if their umbrella is a bit too large.  It isn't my job to convince myself that you are a responsible webmaster who deserves to have their ads shown it is the webmasters.  Having a little message asking me to turn my adblock off will never be enough for me to do it, I'd like to see something a little more tangible like a pledge acknowledging why people use it to begin with and promising not to be irresponsible...I'm not going to give the millions of websites out there the benefit of the doubt and go until I hit a problem and then block them one by one.

Understand my goal here is to force webmasters to police each other somewhat and eventually do away with the obtrusive/ malicious ads altogether and then we wouldn't need adblockers to begin with.  As in my case the only reason I DLed it and use it is because of the over the top ads not the regular ones."	96	60

Ever since then, fans of Star Wars have been divisive over their existence with many using it as a pillar of their claims against the writing of George Lucas.

I disagree with this view. In my eyes, Midichlorians were a clear extension of what Lucas had already established in Return of The Jedi, that the Force is entirely based on biology and the ability to communicate and channel with it's galactic energy is hereditary. 

Luke Skywalker, talking to his sister Leia, says the quote ""The Force is strong in my family. My father has it, I have it, my sister has it'. That line alone establishes the hereditary nature of the Force. This also is further strengthened by the fact that Han Solo and Chewbacca show no abilities, or in the case of Han, personal belief in the Force, meaning that despite it's all-reaching influence on sentient beings, some people among multiple species claim to have never been affected nor shown any ability to communicate with it.

To avoid EU material now listed as either part of the Legends or Canon timeline, and just referecne material from the film and television series, I believe that nothing introduced in regards to Midichlorians contradicts anything present in the original trilogy of Star Wars films

Because first off women have a much more codified gender appearance. Which is important because The Edit:**insult** **of** being mistaken as a man for me comes from the fact that the person is mistaking me for some girl with bright pink ponytails and bright pink dress!However if it's a women who's being mistaken as a man. She'll probably imagine that person who mistook their gender sees them as a persons who's wearing a t-shirt and jeans...which is probably what they are wearing right now... Simply put being mistaken as a women aligns far less with reality then being mistaken as a women.

changemyview	t3_363i1f	https://www.reddit.com//r/changemyview/comments/363i1f/cmv_if_a_killer_asteroid_were_headed_to_earth/	2015-05-15 20:09:26	huadpe	CMV: If a killer asteroid were headed to Earth, Humans would be able to stop it.	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/363i1f/cmv_if_a_killer_asteroid_were_headed_to_earth/	"I say ""killer asteroid"" in the title for brevity, but I mean any celestial object (asteroid, comet, planetoid, etc) large enough to wipe out life on Earth.

I have three basic reasons:

1. We know there are no planet-destroyers in the Asteroid Belt, which means anything that'd take out Earth would need to come from the Kuiper Belt or the Oort Cloud.  Both of these are very far away, and would give us lots of warning, even if the object were presently on its impact trajectory orbit.  More likely, we'd detect it multiple orbits in advance, and have decades or centuries before predicted impact.  But I think we'll at least have multiple years.

2. Nuclear weapons would be pretty effective at deflecting an object.  They are very energy dense, and [we can use a standoff detonation](http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/neo/report2007.html) to cause ablation on one side of the comet/asteroid and nudge it.  We only need a very slight nudge to push it off of an Earthbound trajectory when it is far away.

3. If an impact were imminent, humanity would throw all feasible resources into stopping it.  A lot of the things which make present space travel difficult would be overcome fast.  We would allow launches which have a high chance of spreading radioactive debris onto Earth for instance, or which have a high chance of loss of human life.  We might even send astronauts on a suicide mission.  Of course, money would be no object for this, and massive logistical resources would be poured into anything with a chance of saving us.

Alright, it seems like in this world there are only the good things and the bad things, the black and white, and though I believe the world is not black and white and there is a grey area in between, what is that grey area? I haven't been able to figure it out like, for example: a man steals food from a shop because he doesn't have enough money and he needs to feed his kids, then he gets caught and taken to prison. Though he did something ""bad"" (stealing) for a ""good"" cause (feed his children), he still did something bad therefore he gets a punishment. Where's the grey in that? I don't know.

That's one of my confusions, the grey between the black and white. To be clear, I'm not bigoted or religious and I understand there are diferent types of good and different types of bad depending on your context, where you live.

The other thing I'm confused about and that is fairly linked to the first one is if there's something besides ""the good"" and ""the bad"". I personaly live by trying to do the good but I also think that the bad is necesary until a certain degree.

Very curious to say what the responses are!

Juveniles are given special treatments in trials, there is a focus on rehabilitation an integration back into society. This makes a lot of sense to me, children are still learning and don't have much freedom in life. Many of their choices and actions are an immediate cause of their situation, and removing them from that could potentially help. Not to mention, the focus on punishment in adult courts can likely lead to training a kid to be an offender for life,

Trying a kid as an adult circumvents all of that, and ignores the fact that society expects persons under 18 years of age to need additional supervision and warrant more rehabilitation in the case of crimes. It seems so juvenile that someone who commits a worse crime (and is more in need of rehab) would magically be considered an adult just because of severity. Do actions make someone an adult, or age and experience?

EDIT:
I think it is also important to consider there is a growing amount of evidence that states adolescence continues up until 25[1].

Also, many cases that have children tried as adults aren't emancipated minors, it's typically just due to severity. I would consider an emancipated minor tried as an adult more logical, but possibly more morally wrong for a society to do. Emancipation isn't generally a happy thing, and often due to poor circumstances... more rehabilitation would likely make sense, but I see how it would be logical for a system.

changemyview	t3_39e315	https://www.reddit.com//r/changemyview/comments/39e315/cmv_privilege_is_a_pretty_selfevident_concept/	2015-06-11 03:13:34	JamesDK	CMV: 'Privilege' is a pretty self-evident concept. People who deny it are being willfully ignorant.	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/39e315/cmv_privilege_is_a_pretty_selfevident_concept/	"I legitimately don't understand how anyone could deny that 'privilege' (as a sociological concept) exists. To me, it's so obvious that certain groups receive beneficial treatment as opposed to other groups. On the whole, it's easier to be white than any other race, easier to be straight than any other sexuality, easier to be cis than to be trans, easier to be male than female, easier to be wealthy than to be poor. 

From what I hear, the most common argument from those who deny 'privilege' exists is that (to be reductive) a person with a particular privilege doesn't always sit on the top of the social hierarchy. For instance, a 'privilege denier' will say that privilege doesn't exist because rich blacks have better social outcomes than poor whites, or straight women face less discrimination than gay men. Therefore, white or male privilege doesn't exist, because these are examples of whites and men existing further down the social hierarchy than the people they are supposed to be 'privileged' above. 

I think this is willful ignorance. No one is suggesting that 'privilege' is a zero-sum game, or that some types of privilege are more 'valuable' than others, or that all privilege exists in all situations. Privilege is privilege. A wealthy black man may have a higher income, but that won't stop him being pulled over by the cops or detained when trying to enter his home. A gay man will be subject to homophobic slurs and threats of violence, but a straight woman will be cat-called and endure sexist jokes and sexual harassment.  

Unless you're a black, gay, poor, MtF trans-person, you experience privilege in some portion of your life. You probably don't notice it, because it's the way things have always been. But it's willfully ignorant to say that you're not 'privileged' because some people are in a better station than you are. 

To change my view:

Help me understand why people deny privilege, that isn't rooted in 1.) willful ignorance (citing Tumblr or other sources of bad information on the concept) or 2.) entitlement (""I'm part of a supposedly 'privileged' class: why isn't my life amazing?!?!"") 

I'd like to stay away from arguments from so-called 'privilege deniers' as I think I've explained above why I don't think their arguments hold water, but if you think you've got an argument that dismantles the whole concept of 'privilege': lay it on me.

changemyview	t3_3a3s2o	https://www.reddit.com//r/changemyview/comments/3a3s2o/cmv_im_having_a_hard_time_time_seeing_a/	2015-06-17 00:22:33	counterview	CMV: I'm having a hard time time seeing a functional difference between trans-ethnic and trans-gender.	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3a3s2o/cmv_im_having_a_hard_time_time_seeing_a/	"Apologies in advance, as I'm sure this topic has been done to death in light of recent events. I read a few of the posts and they really didn't do anything to help my confusion. Viscerally, I feel like the two **are** different things and should be treated as such, but every argument I'm seeing seems to fall flat for me and I'm left with the default position: the two are functionally equivalent.

The primary argument I've read against my view is that there are biological differences between how men and women are wired mentally. However, most of the papers I've read on the matter are based on [population studies](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763413003011) that tease out group differences from large and varying datasets. Brains aren't monolithic things that are all one way or another - for that matter, new neuronal connections and pathways can be influenced by surroundings, behavior and a host of other factors. If [where you live can determine whether or not you develop schizophrenia](http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/4/795.full.pdf&amp;), then it's quite possible that growing up with black siblings can subtely affect the brain connections of a white girl from Montana. Stepping back though, why should empirically-observable differences 'legitimize' obvious differences in behavior? Our understanding of brain physiology is nowhere near precise enough to give us a 1:1 correlation between behaviors and biochemistry, and even if it were, it's not clear to me at all that someone's behavior should be invalidated because it doesn't map to our limited biological understanding.

Another argument I read differentiated gender as an individualistic identity and ethnicity as a group identity. I like the thought, but just like brains, black identity isn't a monolithic thing. For every Rachel Dolezal - there are likely thousands of non-black people living in predominantly black neighborhoods, developing identities not terribly different from the black people they most often interact with - your Eminems, to use a terrible example. Saying lack of pigment invalidates that identity seems functionally identical to saying lack of a particular sex-characteristic invalidates a gender identity.

Feel free to point me to a discussion, if you don't want to rehash this. I'm pretty open to having my mind changed on this one, as my feelings seem to be in disagreement with my reasoning.

That way no one waiting to go to the back of the plane has to wait for people stashing their luggage. Boarding priority besides first class is pointless is it not? Who wants to board first just to wait even longer in a small seat. We all leave at the same time. 
I’ve come to understand that in countries like Canada and Norway they’ve already adopted this type of boarding procedure. I’ve also heard (but not seen) that the Myth Busters did a segment on this and found that the current way is the least efficient. Whenever I see a group of people anxious and conjugating around the boarding area, everyone is suspicious and bitter about the people trying to “get their spot”.  Southwest airlines doesn’t have reserved seating, so  it ends up being that those that board first want the first few rows of the plane (make sense), which means that everyone will likely follow suit. In a Boeing 737, the very last passengers to board are likely going to get row 30, barring someone’s preference to be in the back of the plane.

Transformers: Age of Extinction is unanimously rated as the worst Micheal Bay transformers movie. 

Personally, I don't think it was that bad. Sure the plot was an incoherent mess and many transformers had a major personality change, but Age of Extinction did many things better and overall was more entertaining that some of the other Transformers  Movies. 

1. The action sequences were well done. In the other movies, it was hard to tell who was fighting who when things got crazy. I felt like I knew what was happening throughout the fight sequences in this movie. 

2. The one liners were actually funny, and the actors delivered them well. 

3. The characters were great. Hard to explain why, but I liked them. 

In conclusions, I think part of Age of Extinction's hate comes from becoming disinterested after three mediocre Transformer Films. However objectively (if you are willing to ignore the logic flaws of the script), I think Age of Extinction was better than Revenge of the Fallen and the Dark Side of the Moon. "	0	1

I personally feel like these businesses should be forced to close unless enough employees volunteer to keep it open that day, and they'd earn holiday pay (NOT time and a half, double) for doing so. If only a certain amount of people volunteered, the store would be open for half a day or less depending on how many people volunteer.

Is there any reason why that or some alternative idea wouldn't work?

My reasoning for feeling this way is that it is absolutely not fair that retail and similar employees should be forced to stay away from their families and friends and miss out just because the corporations they work for have to earn those few extra bucks. Many of us already miss weekends and have very difficult schedules to work with; throwing having to work a holiday just because the rest of the world wants to shop is just the ultimate slap in the face. Try having a social life while working retail - it doesn't work.

On top of that, on days like today, the amount of business we actually get isn't even truly worth staying open for.

They had their debt of war, after WWII, restructured and they do not want to do the same with Greece* .

If one point out that war debts decided unilaterally by the victorious side and free enrolled debts are different, the classic answer is *all the more reason! Free debts are nothing bad, war debts keep you reminding what you have done and you should not be exempted from that* .

This discussion schema is for me empty, when i do not realize the *emptiness* i have hard time because an empty argument is difficult to confute, because it is not an argument. You cannot confute emptiness.

Said that to avoid to justify the discussion schema of above as an argument  (if i try to confute something that is not an argument, then i acknowledge it as an argument) my reasons why i find the argument empty are the following:

* In a discussion i think that is required to be consistent to some reference point, if we allow no boundaries to arbitrary values and senteces then the *ex falso quodlibet* follows and everything is legit. Therefore there is no argument.
* In sentences like the one mentioned above, that underline that war debts *must* have been payed if free debts should be payed there is a huge arbitrary decision: how much is enough for a war debt that is decided unilaterally and not by both sides to be paid by the losing side? Especially for Germany after ww2, i know that they did bad, but it does not seem for me that having the country shrunk, divided, occupied, controlled, handing over resources in the first years of war (soviet reparations/operation paperclip), and so on, is *not enough*. Even more if one consider that debts set by the victorious side were cancelled by the victorious side and not refused by the German side (like the moratorium of the debt of WWI in 1932 and after). I mean, if someone decides for a punishment and then the same someone removes the punishment, what perverted argument is that the one that was under punishment is to blame?

Therefore, the most polite judgment that i can assign for an argument about comparison between war debts on Germany after WWII and Greece debt of today is that the argument is a non-argument or an empty one.

**important**: i'm not discussing the question if the actual debt of Greece has to be handled according to the EU or in other ways, i'm discussing about a comparison of two different economical situations.

changemyview	t3_3d2x1n	https://www.reddit.com//r/changemyview/comments/3d2x1n/cmv_the_us_congressional_system_is_far_more/	2015-07-13 02:30:15	QuantumTangler	CMV: The US congressional system is far more representative than the Westminster parliamentary system	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3d2x1n/cmv_the_us_congressional_system_is_far_more/	"Something I've noticed is that there is a prevailing opinion that the Westminster parliamentary system (i.e. the one used in Australia, Canada, and the UK) is far more representative of the populace than the US congressional system. This usually stems from the observation that there are generally more political parties at play under Westminster parliamentary systems than is the case under the US's congressional system.

But this argument seems to break down when more closely examined. In particular, my biggest problem with it is that parties in a Westminster system are very different from those in a congressional system.

Specifically, parties in a Westminster system are far, *far* more homogenous and rigid than those in a congressional system. From what I've seen, under the former it is rare to the extreme to vote against your party while in the latter it is notable when a vote is split perfectly along party lines. To give an example, the ""Blue Dog Democrats"" are a subgroup of the Democratic party that often ""crosses the aisle"" to vote with the Republican party. As far as I can tell, that sort of behavior would be likely to get one kicked out of one's party in a Westminster system.

In other words, party discipline is much stronger in a Westminster system than a congressional system.

The strangest thing to me is that this homogeneity kind of appears to defeat the point of having parties in the first place - if the point is that the parties are voted into power and do not split their votes, then why bother to have many different MPs? Surely it would achieve the same effect if each party was just given a block of votes equal to the number of seats they would hold, no?

This all seems rather obvious to me, which tells me that I am most likely missing something significant or perhaps misunderstanding some key feature of the Westminster political system.

For the record, I am from the US and therefore far more familiar with the congressional system than Westminster systems, though I do try to understand both as best I can.

I don't think that's the case. I'm not denying that the US is up to some pretty shady shit with the torture of prisoners, the lack of accountability for police, the mass-spying, etc. But the US has always been up to something shady and I'd say overall we live in the era were the US is probably the least shady it's ever been.



I mean consider the literal genocide of the Native Americans, or the Tuskegee experiments, the CIA brain washing, the brutal and lethal treatment of workers unions, the Red Scares, internment of Japanese-Americans, goddamn slavery and Jim Crow laws, practice of eugenics, the Banana Republics. This is all just as bad as anything America does today and some of it was even worse. So while some people act like America's reached a new low, I think they're more just maintaining the status quo and we're just more aware of the shadiness with modern media.

In reality, entrepreneurs and highly skilled workers go elsewhere when you take away financial incentives.

Libertarianism also assumes people aren't selfish. If you ask a libertarian who would care for the poor and disadvantaged if you take away government programs, he will tell you ""charity."" In reality, few people would voluntarily donate to social services for the poor at today's levels unless required to do so by law.

While it's true that some people are less financially motivated or more generous than others, at the macro level humans are far too self-serving for either option to be practical at a large scale when compared to the predominant Western model of capitalism combined with tax-funded social services.

For clarification: my statement presumes that an efficient, innovative, productive economy is desirable for a society. It also assumes that poverty, starvation, disease, and ignorance are undesirable for a society.

CMV! Are communism and libertarianism both built on the flawed assumption of human selflessness?

Yes I understand they get scholarships and are worth thousands of dollars but when players such as Shabazz Napier report to go to bed without eating because of lack of money that becomes a problem. Most athletes put in 40 hours of practice into their sport a week so the argument of getting a job is invalid considering they have classes to worry about on top of their sport. Division 1 college football coaches see a salary of 1.63 million dollars ( on average) and their salary continues to grow while the actual athletes don't see a dime. These athletes should be appropriately awarded with money made from merchandise sales that use their names. I am not saying that these athletes should be given thousands of dollars but be appropriately compensated for their work.

I think debates are very poor ways to get useful information about candidates.  If you want hard questioning, or to know their stand on the issues, interviews from journalists can do that.  Debates are just grandstanding and ""gotchas.""  

A crisis simulation on the other hand would be really useful for getting information about how candidates would do the job of President.  We would see how they asses a situation, how they handle disagreeing advisors, and how deep their knowledge of government runs.

This is also a technique used in a lot of other situations to train and evaluate people who will hold a lot of responsibility.  If you want to be an astronaut, you're going to be doing a lot of simulations.

As far as getting candidates to do it, I could see this being something that a somewhat more obscure candidate does as a way to generate publicity, and which might catch on.   Probably not for the major party candidates for this election cycle, but maybe in the future.

I personally think that how the general populous' craving for violence while hating on sexual themes is very counter-productive (at least here in the US). I believe how we got this mind set is how violence and sex was perceived back in the Victorian Era where multiple wars were happening within the US and how the upper class thought of nudity as a ""lower class"" trait. This carried over into World War 1 and 2 where violence pretty much saved the US and made it into the giant economy it was and still mostly is today. And also during the Cold War, religion (mainly Christianity where sex is pretty much looked down especially with Homosexuality) was taking over and the US population perceived Russia as a ""Communist Atheist"" county. This old mindset has to stop and thus we need to move on into a more accepting culture. And I'm not talking about ""Oh let's just legalize Pedophilia and Bestiality"", I'm talking about treating sexual themes and violence in the same matter. Also I don't believe we should expose younger children to sexual themes as the same matter with extreme violence within our media.

Edit: Well I have some real life stuff going on so I will see you guys soon had a good chat with everyone of you so yeah take care :)

It is the basis of contract law, of commerce, of nations, of democracy and last but certainly not least, it is the basis of personal relationships. If we are willing to try people for breaches of trust in these areas, why then when someone cheats on their partner can the partner not sue for breach of trust? That's not even accounting for the emotional trauma. I don't think that people should go to prison for it but awarding some level of damages to the other person seems fair to me. I feel like I should mention I've never cheated or been cheated on, this is just something I was thinking of earlier today.
Edit: My view has been changed. Whilst morally speaking I think there should be some method of remedy for the person being cheated on, the practical impossibilities regarding proof make it too hard an issue to solve legally.

1. revenue/expense uncertainties for importers and exporters on both side of the border.  
2. discourages long term planning for travelling to the other country since the associated cost becomes uncertain  
3. loss in economy for the country who's enjoying stronger currency since people will do cross-border shopping. (most apparent when CAD-USD hits parity, many Canadians went south of the border to the point that the government increases allowable spending limit)  

i consider the biggest threat of pegging is if the benchmark country suddenly hits economic boost or depression, but Canada and US have similarly strong economy, so both countries will be impacted quite similarly on economic boost or depression.

My problem is that everyone seems to agree that self harm is bad, but no one can give me a logical argument for why.

So far this is the logic I've heard again and again:
Self harm is bad because it is dangerous. It is dangerous because you could die, or could get an infection.

The problem I have seen with this is that you can replace ""self harm"" with so many other things and still follow the same basic structure.

Lacrosse is bad because it is dangerous. It is dangerous because you could get a concussion.

Cooking is bad because it is dangerous. You could get burned.

Taking Lithium for Bipolar Disorder is bad because it is dangerous.  It is dangerous because it could give you kidney failure.

So I can not accept the false-logic of dangerous = bad. That means anything dangerous is inherently bad, and that is not true.

It is very easy to self harm without any danger.  Sterilize tools, clean and cover wounds, etcetera.

Of course this can still leave permanent scars, but so can getting a tattoo or a piercing, so once again, self harm isn't inherently bad just because it leaves scars.  Lots of things leave scars, so scars aren't what's bad about it.

Okay, but it's a symptom of a bigger problem.  Yes.  And the bigger problem is the thing that should be fixed.  But that *still* doesn't mean that the symptom is bad.

If you have a bacterial infection, you treat the infection.  You don't just cover any redness up with makeup to treat the symptom.  So self harm, the symptom of many mood disorders, isn't what should be treated.

So besides the ridiculously flawed ""it's dangerous"" argument, explain to me why self harm is inherently bad.

Tl;Dr, something being dangerous doesn't make it bad. Give me a real reason why self harm is bad.

**EDIT**  I have to go to bed now, but I will continue this conversation with anyone who posts new comments in the morning.  Thank you to those of you who have offered support, and to those of you whose reasonings avoided condescension.

For example, someone says, ""Hey, the way that guy dresses, he looks really gay (not that there's anything wrong with that.)""

It's almost like an apology for an actual opinion. To me, it's like saying, ""I'm just kidding,"" when you're being serious as a way to soften the blow or take away the heat from the potential for ensuing anger.

Basically, if you're going to say it, just say it and not be ashamed or worried about offending people.

changemyview	t3_3il80t	https://www.reddit.com//r/changemyview/comments/3il80t/cmv_the_star_wars_prequels_were_better_than_the/	2015-08-27 12:06:25	Urkelli	CMV: The Star Wars prequels were better than the original trilogy.	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3il80t/cmv_the_star_wars_prequels_were_better_than_the/	"Not too long ago, I saw the 6 star wars movies in chronological order. I had never seen them before but I have heard so much good about the series that I just had to watch them. As I watched them as an 23-year-old adult, I have no nostalgia for any of the movies what so ever. 

As I finished the series, I honestly thought the hate for the prequels were just a joke, because I thought they were better in every way!

Obviously the effects were better, so I'm not going to comment so much on it, but I will say that better effects makes it easier to get involved in the movie. Better effects makes it feel more real.

The actors in the original trilogy were horrible (with exceptions). Leia, Han and Palpatine were the only good actors in the first trilogy, but in the prequels, the actors were very experienced and knew how to act at a completely different level and I felt a much greater connection to the characters.

The first trilogy had pathetic sword fights. You don't need CGI to make a good fight, just good choreography! It felt like a star wars parody when watching the fight between Obi-wan and Darth Vader, they literally looked like two children playing with sticks! Every swing they made looked like they were intentionally parryable (if that makes sense?). Also, why did obi wan kill himself like that? He seemed perfectly capable of continuing to fight or even beat DV!

The prequels pictured a few very important things: the rise of Palpatine, Anakin turning to the dark side, the age of the jedi and the history of the stormtroopers. Episode 4, 5 and 6 were only about Darth Vaders downfall, and it wasn't very impressive at that... It was incredibly stupid to have a small hole in the death star that could instantly blow if it were struck... Not only was that bad and boring writing, but a stupid contruction! Why not just cover it with a force field? 
In one of the movies, the rebels got a tip to where the generator to the death star force field is located. Later on, it turns out it was a trap by DV and they were ambushed at the planet. If DV was going to spread a rumor were the generator is located so he could ambush the rebels, why the FUCK did he give out the ACTUAL LOCATION TO THE GENERATOR? He could've literally said any location and they would've gone there! He could've planted a bomb at a random moon, lure the rebels there and blow they up! Instead, he sends a handful of soldiers to counter the people that blew up his previous death star! The soldiers even got defeated by rocks and stones!

Also, Luke's stupid hairdo.

The original trilogy is still good, especially when they rescue Han from Jabba. I just think the prequels are lightyears ahead!

Hyper-rationality is the social expectation and pressure that every human action and institution must be teologically justified by rational means, rather than a mixture of reason, emotion, tradition, religion, evolutionary instinct etc. I will use one clear example, for the sake of focus, while knowing that there are other examples of this as well. I will talk about producing off-spring.

In my experience, people against procreating articulate 3-4 arguments against having children. Firstly, that having children will detrimentally affect the environment (1). New humans means more consumers of the Earth's resources and more producers of waste. The long term viability of the earth with exponentially more consumers and producers is uncertain.  Secondly, the cost of having children can be astronomical (2). Thirdly, you become isolated to your social circle and to your spouse due to the time need to take care of your child. 

I present these arguments not because they uniquely matter, but because they seem valid. They are, shall we say for the sake of argument, true.  However, in the pursuit of being rational, these arguments have contradicted one of the most basic and scientific principles of life, namely that animals produce off-spring to survive. It is basic evolutionary biology. We observe this in every known creature; we observe our own instincts to sexual activity and pleasure; we observe people's special fondness to babies (3). Yet, despite this obvious teology of humans, the rational arguments are given preference. This seems to play out on the societal level. Education levels and industrialization (a proxy for culture/rationality) correlate with lower birth rates (4). 

In conclusion, this is but one of many examples where hyper-rationality creates a social pressure that contradicts human instinct.

I commute to school on a bicycle 12km each way every day, so I got the idea to listen to audioooks while cycling to entertain myself. It's great, I feel like I don't miss anything although I'm late at times and have to push myself. Now naturally it's not ideal as it reduces your ability to hear signals from the surrounding traffic. Most of the way it's not a problem, but there are a few stretches with intersections and stuff like that, where you must be on your guard. I feel like I am able to hear people no problem, and I believe it's quite different from music, as this doesn't block out much noise, However it's obviously not ideal. I am however convinced that I does not pose a significant risk and I quite enjoy listenig to audiobooks, so I'll keep on doing it unless you can convince me otherwise.

I really feel like this wasn't the case before and I don't know how its become this way. Unless something you said is so totally outrageous that not even the most braindead moron could take it seriously or you literally leave a sarcasm note at the end of the post. Otherwise get ready for downvotes and angry messages in your inbox

I feel like this kind of thing really takes away from sarcasm, sort of similar to explaining a joke. It just takes away from the whole element of the thing

These kinds of places have always been used by people separated by biological sex, regardless of gender identity. I believe no matter the beliefs of an individual they should be given the choice to either use the predetermined facility based on their sex or not use it at all.

&gt;In a letter sent Monday, the Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Education told the Palatine district that requiring a transgender student to use private changing and showering facilities was a violation of that student’s rights under Title IX, a federal law that bans sex discrimination. The student, who identifies as female but was born male, should be given unfettered access to girls’ facilities, the letter said. 


Instead of allowing the student unaltered access to female facilities, they can instead allow private use in certain circumstances such as in the situation in the article. Doing otherwise is offensive to the opposite sex who are also using the bathroom/changing rooms.

**Edit**: I'm not trying to keep my viewpoint. In fact I'll probably change it as I read more of these replies. Thanks guys."	8	40

This stance is in line with other democratic socialists, none of which have kept countries at the top of production and RGDP.
As a country focused on economic dominance, the U.S.A. cannot radically increase taxes or interest rates to fund all of his campaign promises without major economic repercussions. 

I hold this view as an undergraduate economics major at a relatively conservative school in the U.S.A. I see myself as a fiscal conservative and social liberal. I tend to vote republican on the local level and democrat on the national level, mostly for economic reasons. It is my belief that social trends will change with the times, and that it is much more likely that the president will have an effect on the economy than social issues like abortion, in part due to the congressional deadlock.

1. First, there is no evidence that any of the nationals were refugees beyond a easily-faked passport. The impressions that refugees were a part of this is without strong standing and unworthy of serious policy discussion.

2. Second, the situation of refugees is untenable - that's why they have refugee status. We, as a world, have decided that people of this status must be given special ways to escape their home situation. To turn them away because of a few possible bad actors is the worst form of cowardice.

3. Third, it is the explicit mission of Daesh to draw a line between Muslims and non-Muslims and, by encouraging societal oppression, to push more Muslims to their fold. Such statements **actively support** Daesh's mission instead of weakening them by removing possible support.

I worry that people supporting these are giving in to fears of their constituencies instead of doing the research and leading.

I'd also like to point out pirating this type of show is immoral if you are a Nielson family.

I'd like to start out by saying I think pirating movies, games and music is immoral, although it is not objectively as bad as straight up stealing.

For those of you who don't know how TV shows are funded I'll give you a brief overview. A shows success is measured based on ratings, if a show has higher ratings (more viewers) it increases the shows likelihood of being renewed. Ratings are calculated by the Nielson system. 50 thousand families are given a box where they input what they watch and the ratings are calculated by averaging out these and multiplying them by the estimated amount of people watching TV.

I won't go into issues with the Nielson system, I'm just going to say that with this system there is nothing wrong with pirating a show rather than watching it on TV.

I don't think pirating a TV show is immoral because you are not in any way taking away from the show's income. If you watch a show on TV the show is not gaining money from your viewership unless you are a Nielson family, therefore not watching on TV and pirating said show is not taking anything away from the TV show. If you have a Nielson box you are contributing to the shows success and are morally obligated to watch over the air rather than pirate because you actually impact the shows success. The show benefits based on your potential viewership, not your actual viewership, you are not in any way taking away from the show by not watching on TV and therefore it is not immoral.

So go ahead and change my view! I'm interested in seeing what some of the responses will be."	8	74

Paying the cell companies extra money in order to have a smartphone and access to the internet is a waste, especially since I have access to public, schools, home, and work WiFi spots. All of the tasks that would be considered ""productive"" on a smartphone can be accomplished from many other, cheaper devices. A laptop/computer can accomplish anything a phone can at much faster speeds. I can use a GPS for maps and locations. I can use books and/or a kindle to use for reading. 
Also, a smart phone lures you into the trap of always needing to be connected to the internet. As someone from the millennial generation, it is apparent and sad to see how social gatherings are spent around showing each other YouTube videos or looking at stuff on Facebook or Snapchat. Therefore, I see no productive reasoning for buying a smartphone aside from wanting to simply own something for the sake of looking cool/being in the loop. Please CMV, and also aim to convince me that despite already having a cellphone, laptop, and tablet that I personally should switch to a data plan.

I'm sure I'm not the only one who has noticed it, but the Syrian refugee crisis has really brought out some of the nastiest elements in our society. Some quotes I've seen on facebook and elsewhere:

""Our president is muslim terrorist piece of shit.""

""We all know not all muslims are terrorists, but all terrorists are muslims.""

""All the syrians affiliate themselves with ISIS and wish to destroy us.""

While these are just a few examples of comments made about the Syrian refugee crisis, they illustrate how radical the far right is becoming and how little they value true information. This kind of baseless hatred will sew more domestic terrorism, and is actually more of a threat (considering a lot of these people are gun owners) than radical Islam within the borders of U.S. It's easier to track people from the Middle East than it is the millions of people here that espouse views that are just as radical as Islamic extremists.

Edit: Some great replies from the right, and I concede many of their views. I'm not sure anyone actually changed my view but certainly moderated it.

You play in high school, and hope to god a college scout sees you and picks you up. You play in college, and hope to god a pro scout sees you and picks you up. There's no other real way to make it into those leagues. 

What it does is causes a bunch of people with no desire for college to go to college for the wrong reasons. They don't care about furthering their education or anything that; they're just there in hopes a scout sees them. This seems like it would only negatively effect the education of the rest of the students, as part of their classmates have no desire to be there for anything related to education.

Instead, these leagues should have a large affiliate network of professional minor leagues they use, like how the NHL does it.

They have a draft once a year for everyone 18 years old and older. 

* If you're drafted, but still want to go to college, you're allowed to go to college, and are considered a prospect of the team that drafted you until you're done college.

* If you're drafted, and have no desire to go to college, and are already ready to play in the major league, you do so.

* If you're drafted, and have no desire to go to college, but aren't ready to play in the major leagues, you go to the professional minor league affiliate of the team that drafted you. 

It would allow the generational talents of their time, like say, Michael Jordan, who was **highly** sought after by multiple major colleges, to skip college if they chose, and go directly to the NBA.

It would allow players who had no desire for college, but weren't good enough to go straight to the major league team, like say, Drew Brees, a chance to play professionally and build up their game, without having to go to college if they had no desire for it.

It would allow players who wanted to go to college no matter what, like Jonathan Quick, the chance to do so, while still granting them the ability to go to either a minor or major league team when they were done.

It makes no sense to force people to go to college just in hopes they can get picked up, when it highly undermines the educational institution."	320	59

I think world governments need to find a way to put material in the air and cool the global temperatures, without causing negative side effects or at least making an overall net good effect. The Internet of things will make monitoring the global cooling program safer and more effective, I think. 

With that said, we should continue to cut emissions. I just don't think it's going to be enough.

Cold seems to kill more people than heat. A bunch more people.
Also cooling is cheaper than heating:

We're all familiar with the consequences of global warming:
http://www.nrdc.org/globalwarming/fcons.asp

But what about consequences of global cooling?
I understand it's a long video but it's worth a watch:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R31SXuFeX0A

TL:DW
CO2 in the atmosphere would likely fuel plant growth and facilitate agriculture.
I understand that some places would be worse off with the heat but others would become better.
Clearly fossil fuels are more efficient that renewable energies, and much cheaper, freeing up resources.

Shouldn't people listen to what the skeptics have to say instead of just shutting them down and labeling them as climate change deniers? I think they make a better case, CMV.

I put together this graph to illustrate a gap. Above you see a random sample of graduation rates. I just wiki'ed an alphabetical list of CA high schools. Graduation rates are high

Below you see results from the states Early Assessment Program (EAP). The EAP tests Juniors on college readiness. You see those scores in the toilet. For instance, my school just got an award for our high graduation rate from the State's Superintendent. It's at 97%. However, our EAP result for math sits at 8%. 8% of students are proficient in algebra 2. 

- the argument not all kids should go to college. Okay...the first two years of college are high school level material; just faster, with a higher Lexile, and no high school supports. It's what high schoolers should know if there wasn't this culture of coddling supports. 

- direct kids to the trades....okay. We ignore that many trades are requiring greater levels of education. Auto shop works on internal combustion engines. They need to learn about electric motors and computer brain boxes. Plumbers use algebra, and you should see the number of kids who fail basic algebra as Juniors. "	276	142

I'm currently 17 years old--I state that only because I feel it's relevant.  I urge you to refrain from using an argument from age or wisdom, as the fact that I am 17 does not invalidate my reasoning. 

First, I should clarify what I mean when I say that we have the right to commit suicide.  For the purposes of this conversation, a right is the capacity to perform a specified act and not be justly condemned or punished for it.  For instance, I think humans have a right to freedom of thought.  To me, that simply means that you cannot justly condemn or punish someone for thinking, even if you don't want them to think the way they do.  Any moral gripe you have with the action we are calling a ""right"" is invalid. That is how I think about rights; now, onto my thesis.

Everybody has the right to commit suicide.  To me, and for the purposes of this discussion, that simply means that, if a person chooses to commit suicide, nobody can condemn them and morally do so. 

Kant, a very famous philosopher came up with a very important part of morality: that preservation of autonomy is a central moral precept.  A natural extension of this is the idea that nobody should be forced to do something they didn't consent  prior to.  To disobey this moral axiom is to perpetrate the very essence of evil. 

My second note is that nobody consents to living.   The nature of existence is such that we are ""thrown"" into this world without prior consent.  Heidegger used a brilliant term for this--geworfenheit, roughly translating to ""thrown-ness"".  

This transgression against autonomy would usually spur moral indignation, but because it was perpetrated by nature rather than a conscious agent, we shrug and move on.  I would concede that it doesn't make sense to express moral resentment towards nature.  That would be counter-productive.  However, we must stay mindful of this violation when thinking about suicide. 

Here is the crux of my argument: because we were robbed of the choice to live or not live before we were conceived, we must extend that choice to everyone as a right.  Else, those discontent with existence would be _forced_ to endure existence against their will, which is in and of itself immoral.

CMV.

EDIT:
Thank you, everyone for posting your feedback!!  It was really nice getting all of your perspectives.  Overall, I thought it was a very productive conversation.  Unfortunately, I really do have to get to bed now.  I'll try to respond to more comments tomorrow night, because I'm going to be gone all day tomorrow.  If it makes you feel any better, I am largely convinced suicide isn't the best option for me.  I still firmly believe that suicide is a fundamental right that cannot be infringed, but I also believe that I am going to just continue with existence.  I teeter, of course, but I've felt pretty good with the psychotherapy and medication I've been taking as treatment.  You don't have to fear for my safety, really.  I appreciate all of your input!!

No, my opinions do not reflect those of all black people's, nor are they any more correct because I'm black.  Using my post as an excuse to dis HBCUs is only gonna get us both posted to /r/AsABlackMan  :P 

Now for the actual reasons I've formed this opinion:

 * There are no top-tier [HBCU](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hbcu) schools, especially for students in STEM fields.  Choosing an HBCU means less recognized/less funded facilities

 * If you got into an HBCU, you could get into an objectively better [PWI](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=PWI).  Any reasons for picking an HBCU boil down to not thinking you could stick it out at a PWI

 * By going to an HBCU you're choosing a school with a culture similar to your own.  You're choosing to stay in a more stagnant environment that will foster less personal growth

 * If you're going to an HBCU for a better chance at meeting a life partner of your own race, well that's just an expensive way to get into the dating scene

My background:  I'm a black woman pursuing an engineering degree at one of the top ten schools in the states for my program (hint: it's a PWI).  I don't know anyone personally from my generation who chose to attend an HBCU.  I understand on a personal level that racism exists in PWIs and that it can be pretty draining on a day-to-day basis.

I'll be back in about an hour to respond to y'all.  Thanks in advance.  :)

His rhetoric is further isolating terrorists and reinforcing their belief that the United States is ""anti-Muslim"".  The State Department has said ISIS is already using his racist remarks to recruit.

It also drowns out the voices of moderate Muslims who urge Americans not to jump to conclusions when their is a terrorist attack and assume it was carried out because of Muslims. As the NY Times has recently pointed out, [Christians have actually committed more terrorist attacks on U.S. soil than Muslims](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/25/us/tally-of-attacks-in-us-challenges-perceptions-of-top-terror-threat.html?_r=0) but the perception is whenever a terrorist attack occurs its because of Muslims.

God as a concept is not easily defined, so much so that I think having one concept to decribe what Deists, Theists and Pantheists believe in is ridiculous and unnecessary. I don't believe in a Pantheist or Deist interpretation of God, but I can understand why others might believe. The God of Christianity, Islam and Judaism is in my opinion very unlikely, to the point where it might as well not exist.

Point #1: Self-contradiction

This is probably the most straightforward point, omnipotency is a self-contradictory concept. There are numerous paradoxes involved with this, including the common one asking whether God could create a boulder so heavy he could not lift it, or the question of whether God knows what he will do next (which would be required of an omniscient being but leaves him unable to do anything different from what he knows he will do).

Point #2: Space could not have been created

One of the most common arguments for the existence of God is the cosmological argument, but I think that doesn't work for numerous reasons. The main one in my book comes from the Theory of Relativity. An important aspect of that theory is that time and space are linked in whats called spacetime. So if space is created, then time was created with it, one could not exist without the other. If time did not exist, then that renders the whole concept of cause and effect invalid. Without the laws of cause and effect, then it is impossible for God to cause the universe to exist. In fact I would argue that ""before spacetime"" itself is a nonsensical concept, since without time how can a ""before"" even be plausible?

I imagine someone will argue that God could exist in his own timeline of sorts, and simply create our time and space. I think this makes the concept of God, because then there would be some aspect of our universe that he didnt create. This would therefore not be the greatest conceivable being that a God. If he is not responsible for the existence of all space and time, then can he really be called a God?

This would be an unnecessary being, and thus I think it is pointless to believe in unnecessary beings. It could be treated in all ways as though he does not exist.

Point #3 The Problem of Evil

Its an old argument, which is why I put it last, but it warrants a mention because it is still a good one. An all powerful being could stop evil, and any good being would want to. I imagine most theists have heard the argument itself so I won't dwell on it. Instead I will just take on the many counterarguments.

1. Free Will: for starters I don't really believe in free will, but I'll grant it for the sake of argument. Why is having free beings better than beings which are always moral? Also, an evil act can take away someone's free will, like for example if a person was to kidnap and torture another person, by doing nothing God is taking the freedom of the torturer over the freedom over the freedom of the person being tortured. The main problem however with this argument is that is only attempts to explain human cause evil. Unless you are going to say that diseases and disasters have free will, which is silly.

2. Greater Goods. This is an odd argument to make in defence of an all powerful being, as it says that God allows evil to exist for some ""greater good"", usually one beyond human comprehension. Why would an all powerful being need to allow evil to have his greater good? Could God not have a perfectly good universe without evil?


---

I may update this with more arguments if I think of them. Also, I don't think I will be convinced by arguments that create a gap for God to exist in, where the concept remains unnecessary. It would have to be not only possible, but plausible that God could exist.

changemyview	t3_4ctm6z	https://www.reddit.com//r/changemyview/comments/4ctm6z/cmv_if_you_are_not_capable_of_and_willing_to/	2016-04-01 03:10:01	bvcvbtsw	CMV: If you are not capable of and willing to raise a child, having PIV (Penis in Vagina) sex is irresponsible, negligent, and possibly even immoral	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/4ctm6z/cmv_if_you_are_not_capable_of_and_willing_to/	"This is not an argument based on religion. However, it does partially rest on the notion that abortion (especially second and third term abortion) is not a perfectly moral thing but rather a lesser of two evils (the other being giving birth to a child and not being able to properly care for it). I believe that abortion should be totally legal and accessible to all women/girls, for pragmatic reasons (perhaps the biggest being that if it is not legal many women will attempt to get an illegal abortion anyway and seriously injure or kill themselves in the process, so they might as well be able to get one legally and safely). So this is not an argument against abortion being legal either. Furthermore, this argument is not meant to target women, because both the man and the woman have an equal choice to engage in consensual sex, and therefore are equally responsible for the outcomes involved (I'm choosing to leave rape out of this discussion; this post only applies to consensual sex). Also please remember that realistically speaking, abortion is not always an option. Sometimes pregnancy is not discovered until it is too late to get a legal abortion (past a certain number of weeks in many states in the USA), or until it is so late that the woman can not justify to herself getting an abortion (as far as I know many women would not be comfortable getting a post-viability abortion under most circumstances). Also factors such as cost and accessibility can delay the time until a woman can get an abortion (when it is not covered by insurance and the woman has a low income, she has to save up for the cost of the procedure and the transportation to the nearest clinic, which can be very far away). Thus even if a woman plans on abortion, she may ultimately not be able to get one.

When a couple chooses to have sex, they accept the possibility that it will result in a pregnancy. This is a possibility that must be considered, because no birth control methods are 100% effective. Even combining condoms and Birth Control Pills is imperfect (even if only .01% of couples who use them properly get pregnant each year). Hell, even a vasectomy or ""tying the tubes"" is not a 100% guarantee. Thus when an informed couple has sex, they are knowingly risking a pregnancy. The risks to themselves are not important here, because they are aware of and consent to the possible risks to themselves. Note that some possible risks to the woman include the physical dangers to herself of pregnancy, the risk of having to get an abortion (expensive, time consuming, and guilt-inducing for some, especially if it ends up being late in pregnancy), and the risk of giving up large chunks of her life to raise a child. Some possible risks to the man include giving up large chunks of his life to raise the child or paying child support. But these are not the important risks for this argument, because the people taking them consent to the risks. Just like every person consents to risks to themselves everyday when they step outside or drive in a car for instance. The problem here is the risks to the non-consenting third party (the hypothetical fetus/child). The hypothetical fetus/child risks being aborted, or being raised in a shitty life (in the abusive foster care system for instance), and it did not consent to these risks. How is it fair for a man and a woman to put a hypothetical fetus/child at risk (however small that risk is), solely for their own pleasure?

In summary, according to my points above, an unplanned pregnancy is a moral dilemma where both choices (abortion and giving birth to the child), if there even is a choice (sometimes abortion is unexpectedly not an option), have a negative moral outcome. Therefore the only way to 100% prevent this dilemma is not having PIV sex in the first place, unless you are capable of and willing to raise a child properly. 

CMV because I don't want to feel guilty about having sex for the next ~15 years.

I've heard projections saying that if Sanders is to win though pledged delegates, then he'll need to win key primary states like New York with 70-30 margins. He won't be able to make up losses in California should he lose this upcoming primary. 

Even if neither candidate comes out with a majority of the required amount of delegates to win the nomination, why would superdelegates switch to Sanders? That was plausible a few months ago, but if Sanders can't start pulling big wins, it's over.

That said if someone can convince me that dry TP actually cleans better then more deltas will be awarded. 

I believe that flushable wet wipes (not baby wipes which are not designed to be flushed down a toilet) are a far superior to traditional dry toilet paper when used to clean oneself after defecating. To be clear I dont advocate replacing dry toilet paper with wet wipes in all situations. My view is that when it comes to #2 wet wipes will do a much better job at cleaning your butt that dry toilet paper. My reasons for having this view are as follows:

1. They clean better than traditional dry toilet paper
2. You can clean more with less
3. The wipes are more durable and are less likely to shred or break while using them
4. They help you avoid skidmarks, dingleberries, and itchy buthole
5. Wet Wipes are are just more comfortable to use than dry toilet paper.

I dont believe that simply moistening traditional TP achieves the same result. Obviously a downside to wet wipes is that you must have them on you if you want to use them at public restrooms. I see this as a slight inconvenience but not a reason to change my view. In addition if a person makes it a habit to have wet wipes with them at all times you will never have to worry about there not being any TP at public restrooms.

What do you all think? Can you Change my view?

Like if we set the rules of a building to (approx.) five walls and a door, the basic status of building art is anything created with five walls and a door. Then the more and more creative we get with breaking the rules, the more and more we consider it 'art'. Which lets some people say: ""This is just a building"" and others, ""this is an incredible work of art"".

Or a necklace is something that loops around the neck worn for decoration. The more and more elaborate we get with following the rules (adding pendants, stones, layers of material around the neck) or less (chokers, invisible strings, simple chains) the more a necklace is a work of art.
 
I feel like I'm missing large pieces of this idea, so I was hoping you could help enlarge it with some arguments!

changemyview	t3_4nbcwr	https://www.reddit.com//r/changemyview/comments/4nbcwr/cmv_the_separate_sovereigns_rule_should_be/	2016-06-09 15:38:28	huadpe	"CMV: The ""separate sovereigns"" rule should be abolished with respect to criminal law, and double jeopardy should apply between Federal and State prosecutions."	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/4nbcwr/cmv_the_separate_sovereigns_rule_should_be/	"Justices Ginsburg and Thomas filed a joint concurrence today in [*Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle*](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-108_k4mp.pdf) which questioned the ""separate sovereigns"" rule in criminal law.

This rule allows the state and federal governments to both try a defendant for the same underlying act and both exact punishment.  An example of this is the case of Dylann Roof, the guy who shot up a church in Charleston because the parishoners were black.  He [is being charged in both Federal and State court for the same crime.](http://blog.simplejustice.us/2015/07/25/two-courtrooms-at-once/)

I do not think this should be permissible.  Inasmuch as the 5th amendment has been incorporated against the states, that incorporation should meaningfully enforce its guarantee that ""nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.""  

Even when dealing with truly awful criminals, I do not think we should toss out our constitutional guarantees against double jeoprardy.  With the [vast expanse of Federal criminal law,](http://www.heritage.org/research/factsheets/2011/04/overcriminalization-an-explosion-of-federal-criminal-law) the separate sovereigns rule virtually guarantees that anyone could be tried twice if they garnered enough public outrage to catch the eye of both Federal and local prosecutors.

**Edit:** To clarify my starting position here because it's come up in a couple comments:  I don't want to change the basics of double jeopardy law as far as what crimes are so similar as to constitute double jeopardy.  There's plenty of caselaw on that.  Rather, I'm saying that the Feds should not be able to bring a charge that, if that law existed at the state level, would be barred by double jeopardy.  And vice versa.

Democracy is founded on the idea that your vote matters. Such a direct example of your vote not mattering would make it clear that your vote never really matters if it is something that enough of the ruling class disagrees with you on.

Since it is a cornerstone of democracy that ultimately everyone has an equal voice, failure to enforce the referendum would remove this cornerstone and completely delegitimize British democracy.

As we currently understand it, punishment has three purposes: punishment (duh), rehabilitation, and deterrence. However, one of the purposes, punishment, doesn't serve to benefit society but instead harms people. Thus, from a utilitarian point of view, a criminal's punishment shouldn't be intentionally punitive; instead, criminals should be sentenced to something that rehabilitates them and deters other would-be criminals, with the punitiveness only coming as a result of the deterrence and rehabilitation. 

While rehabilitation and deterrence leave an overall positive benefit on society, the effect of intentionally making punishment punitive has an overall negative effect. Rehabilitation helps prevent criminals from reoffending, while deterrence helps reduce the likelihood that people would commit crimes in the first place. Because crime is unwanted, a reduction in crime would benefit the majority of people. On the other hand, punishment has no known benefits to society, and causes criminals to feel more resentment towards the authorities ordering said punishment, thus reducing the effectiveness of rehabilitation. Plus, punishment hurts criminals because it is unpleasant by definition. Due to its lack of purpose and its harms to society, as well as its harms to criminals, punishment is utilitarianly bad while rehabilitation and deterrence are utilitarianly good.

I am not denying that it is bad, it is bad! But there is exactly zero that I as an individual or any other individual can do about it.

We can't stop driving cars. It's to fundamentally important to society. And it's not even the most significant source of greenhouse gasses. The individual can do nothing about it and yet we are made to feel like a terrible person just for living. 

To me the biggest problem is overpopulation. If we could somehow magically fix that then all of these other problems would fix themselves, as the rate of CO2 production would fall below the levels that nature can deal with and it would decrease. But we can't magically fix that, because that's genocide and we have decided that that is bad. Edit (This is off course a joke, I know genocide is bad)

So am I crazy? What can I or any other normal person actually do? Protesting will achieve nothing. And green parties across the world always take things way too far. 

Change my view

Edit: many people have pointed out that what I do to combat climate change is not mirrored by the vast majority of people. And for this reason my view has been changed."	12	107

Trump has taken the GOP stereotype and dialed it up to 11. He represents the vocal minority of the GOP that people often make strawman arguments against. He's made a mockery of the party repeatedly, and every notable republican has at some point over the past year taken a moment to denounce him (even if they have reluctantly decided to back him now). I believe that this will turn off many current republican voters from the party, and especially new young voters who might otherwise swing republican. He's just too much crazy for most people. Perhaps converting to independent, libertarian, or something new.

Hillary has messed up. They tried to rig the election ever so subtly, but there are now too many very blatant examples of the people's voice being ignored. The emails we keep getting confirm this. The money she accepts from companies confirm this. The numerous questionable primary results all over the country confirm this. Meanwhile, she is clearly guilty of a federal crime and, if she were anyone else, would absolutely be in prison right now, or at least tied up in an infinite amount of red tape. And on top of all that, the DNC themselves favored Hillary through this whole thing, and everyone was watching. Democrats will question the DNC big time now. Bernie has the power right now to move many Dems to Independent, Green, or something else.

I don't think the GOP shift will happen if Hillary wins, because they will unite against Hillary. Similarly, if Trump wins, I think Bernie will choose to keep the power of the Democrat party behind him rather than splinter it, in an effort to unite against Trump.

All that really does is double the number of ratings, changing the scale from 0-10 or 0-12 and so on.

A six star rating system is clearly superior in my opinion.  If, for example, you are doing a survey of some kind, a six star rating system forces the subjects of your poll to choose a side when they are largely on the fence.  There is a notable difference between 3 out of six stars and four out of six stars, whereas in the five star rating system these people would almost assuredly pick the middle option, telling the pollster very little.  This goes past the star system, as it is also accurate in polling where the options are Totally agree, mostly agree, etc.  I see no reason to use a rating or survey system where there is a middle option."	14	27

To remind anyone who hasn't seen it for a while, the Noisy Cricket is a tiny MIB gun which is extremely powerful. K's boss tells him to arm J, and K gives him the Noisy Cricket which he uses trying to catch the bug guy a few minutes later.

Reasons why it's a terrible weapon:

* Its tiny size would make it really hard to aim accurately.
* The comically intense recoil sends the shooter flying backwards ten feet or so. This is a terrible thing for a weapon, as the shooter is now vulnerable and disoriented after each shot.
* The gun has a massive blast area, much wider than even something like a sawed off shotgun. This would make it very difficult to disable a threat without putting nearby people at risk.

Reasons why K was irresponsible:

* K gives J the gun without warning him about its intense recoil or its blast area. What if J had fired it while standing with his back to a ledge or something sharp? What if there had been a hostage situation and J had fired it at the hostage taker? The blast would have easily killed the hostage as well.

* J is already well trained on using a standard issue police pistol. Wouldn't it be more responsible to have him start off with a gun he understands and is comfortable with? At least until he's had a few hours on the range with the noisy cricket to get some experience with it?

For these reasons, I think it was a terrible weapon choice for J's first armed MIB mission, and K was very irresponsible for giving it to him. Whether it was negligence (maybe he was so used to using MIB weapons that he didn't consider J's lack of knowledge/experience with them) or some kind of desire to emasculate J by giving him a tiny gun (which doesn't really make sense considering how powerful the weapon is), K's decision was irresponsible and he should have been reprimanded by his boss.

Yet 48 states do exactly that.

I live in Tennessee. In all models, even assuming an unprecedented landslide for Clinton, Tennessee and all eleven electors still go to Trump by a wide margin. The same goes for voters in nine other states, per Nate Silver.

http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-a-clinton-landslide-would-look-like/

Why, then, should I vote for either one? My vote will have zero effect on the outcome of the election. The most reasonable vote to cast would then be to vote in protest of the winner-take-all system.

An identical argument can be made for any gerrymandered district, which these days is most of them.

changemyview	t3_507682	https://www.reddit.com//r/changemyview/comments/507682/cmv_the_people_who_are_more_upset_about_when/	2016-08-29 20:35:59	gagnonca	CMV: The people who are more upset about when Kaepernick decided to protest than they are about why he decided to protest are the reason why he is protesting in the first place.	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/507682/cmv_the_people_who_are_more_upset_about_when/	"### Background for anyone who is not familiar:

Collin Kaepernick, the soon to be backup QB of the SF 49ers, refused to stand during the National Anthem during their preseason game last week. This drew a lot of attention on social media, but for all the wrong reasons. Twitter and Facebook were flooded with memes about how he is [disrespecting](http://i.imgur.com/Nseb6Bb.jpg) the [military](http://i.imgur.com/Bk6tUtT.jpg), and has no right to be upset because he [makes a lot of money](http://i.imgur.com/EYlHwHB.jpg), and has [white parents](http://i.imgur.com/aKNROKz.jpg). The problem is that none of these personal attacks have anything to do with why Kaep is protesting. 

If you are going to start insulting him for not joining the military, then you are also insulting over [90% of the population in the US](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/what-percentage-of-americans-have-served-in-the-military/). Furthermore, how much money someone makes and what color skin their parents have has no bearing on which issues they are allowed to protest. 

### My view

Kaep has made the intention of his protest very clear right from the start:

&gt;""**I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color**,"" Kaepernick told NFL Media in an exclusive interview after the game. ""To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder."" [[source]](http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000691077/article/colin-kaepernick-explains-why-he-sat-during-national-anthem)

Kaep has also made it very clear that his refusal to stand has nothing to do with the military: 

&gt; ""**I have great respect for the men and women that have fought for this country**,"" said Kaepernick. ""I have family, I have friends that have gone and fought for this country. And they fight for freedom, they fight for the people, they fight for liberty and justice, for everyone. That’s not happening. [[source]](http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000691874/article/colin-kaepernick-ill-continue-to-sit-during-national-anthem)

Despite Kaep saying repeatedly that he respects the military and did this to protest injustices against minorities, people still decided to take this protest and focus the conversation around how it personally upsets them. People are taking about how he chose to protest, or when he chose to protest. This seems like cognitive dissonance to avoid an uncomfortable conversation about the real problems in this country. I get that some people attach a greater significance to the National Anthem than most, and those people have every right to be upset, but if you are upset about that and not upset about the racism still in this country, then this protest was for you. It is okay to be upset about when he chose to protest and also why he chose to protest.

I think my personal favorite group to come out of this are the, ""I fought for his right to not stand, but fuck him for not standing"" people. The hypocrisy would make me laugh if I weren't so aggravated.

The thing that aggravates me is that the conversation is being dominated by people who only want to talk about how his actions offended them. Hardly anyone is standing up and recognize that the problems that Kaep is protesting is a real problem. And until we are able to get people to admit that there is a problem, nothing is ever going to change. You are allowed to be offended by the timing, but still agree with the message; however, if you get more angry about a guy not standing during the national anthem than you do about innocent men getting murdered with no repercussions, then you are the reason why we need people like Kaep protesting.

I'm not saying he picked the best timing, but I am saying people are letting that distract them from why he did it. This is a total copout. They are turning the argument away from racism and making it about how he chose to protest and why it upsets them personally.

We are considering one or two new mods to help us with moderation duties.

We are particularly looking for mods who have a real interest in CMV already, and are willing to do the essential (but not-so-glamorous) administrative tasks of going through the list of reported comments and posts and deciding whether they should be approved or removed, alongside other mod duties.

If you're interested, please reply below with answers to the following:

1) How much time could you consistently spend moderating CMV?

2) What times would you be most active and inactive?

3) What do you like about /r/changemyview?

4) A reported comment contains offensive references or slurs against some group as part of an argument against the preceding comment. What do you do?

5) What behavior would justify a ban on the first offense?

6) How do you feel about CMV's current rules? Are there any you think need improved or would have difficulty enforcing?

7) Why should you be a moderator of CMV?

8) Do you moderate any other subreddits? If yes, what are they? (This certainly isn't a necessity)

A similar approach, in general, has been applied across many different institutions and social discourses e.g. science, technology, sociology, psychology, medicine, civil service, corporations etc., viz, the application of rationalisation,management science and concepts from cognitive science to every area of human life.

Some of what this means are the following: The preponderance of such concepts in everyday language as:

Calculability: The idea that things can be counted, assessed, appraised for objective value

Rationality: The use of the minimum input for the maximum output, the elimination of waste, the streamlining of processes

Instrumentality: The exploitation of means to get to ends, the seeing of the world as a constellation of means to arrive at known results

Computerisation: The use of computer metaphors and concepts to construe, imagine and define human and animal biology and psychology

Itemisation: The construal of humans, animals and other phenomena as discrete objects with known identifiable clear anc calculable properties that can be appraised

Modularity: The construal of humans and social groups as things that can have modular elements added to them e.g. people acquiring skills, skill sets, competencies

Ok so you might ask where I'm going with all of this? I just want to point out that variations on these concepts have interpenetrated so many fields, which eventually leak into the mainstream, that our 'natural' way of describing human life is now being filtered through a very artificial medium.

For example, someone might talk about a romantic relationship being 'successful' if both partners 'co-operate and regulate each other's feeling'

People may say that an autistic person 'faces challeneges' but can work to 'develop competencies' in order to 'overcome barriers'

Perhaps these are not the best examples but I do want to stress that the spread of utilitarian logic into our ways of speaking renders humans to be more limited than they are, less feeling than they are, to have less subjective interiority than they have and to underplay the pursuit of ends as ends in themselves.

changemyview	t3_582t40	https://www.reddit.com//r/changemyview/comments/582t40/cmv_the_us_should_change_its_electoral_process/	2016-10-18 08:58:15	as-well	CMV: The US should change it's electoral process	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/582t40/cmv_the_us_should_change_its_electoral_process/	"This CMV is simple. I believe that the US First-Past-The-Post system is terribly outdated and makes politics way less competitive than it should be. For many voters, Congress elections became less and less competitive, to the point where some estimate not even 6% of the house seats are competitive between the parties (see https://ballotpedia.org/U.S._House_battlegrounds,_2016 )

This hurts democracy and governance, because it's no longer a ""battle of ideas"" where the voters decide which way the election should go. 

I want to propose two alternatives. First, a two-step process could make sure that voters can have their preference truly heard. French elections follow a model where in the first round, anybody can be elected; if no-one gets 50%, the two candidates with the highest number of votes go to a runoff election two weeks later. Some US states already have similar systems (Jungle Primaries, for example). French elections are different, though, because each party only proposes one candidate, as opposed to open primaries where anyone can run under any party label. It's even possible to forgoe the limitation in the second round, such as Swiss senate and government elections where in the second round, anyone is electable, but the parties and candidates usually confer about whom from their ideological side is best electable and hence typically fewer candidates run in the second round.

Second, to make elections truly competitive, some sort of proportional representation could achieve that goal. There are different models out there. German elections have party list as well as single-member districts; each voter can vote for a candidate as well as a party list. Such directly elected representatives count against the party list outcome, so that no party has more elected members than their proportional result dictates, but voters get a choice to elect a politician best fitting the needs of their district.

To change my view, I would propose that you show me how the American first-past-the-post electoral system benefits both voters and the functioning of the American government as a whole.

Edit: To be clear, when I mean FPTP I am talking about one round single member district FPTP.

Assumption 2: Sociopathic traits would give them an edge on running for and holding a public office.

Assumption 3: Power hungry sociopaths that gain power by exploitation of weakness and lying would likely be poor representatives of regular people.

Therefor, we should require brain-scans for candidates for public office and have them analyzed by medical professionals for signs of sociopathy. We may still choose to elect them but I think it is our right to know.

But then I saw this (long) video: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wrwuk6NoMv8

It really made me think about Christianity in a way I hadn't before. I had been very liberal but I was slowly turning more and more to the right, so I actually sought that video out to help that process. In the end I got a lot more.

I sort of had a... feeling, both mental and almost even physical, that seemed to me like what people probably talk about when they say they 'found Jesus'.

So I spent about a week or two full of invective, until it sort of petered out. At this point I feel like I could go either way, the very definition of agnostic I guess.

In a way I think I'd like to move towards Christ rather than away though...

The divides we see in America right now are actually a product of the left's rhetoric, which is closer to breeding tyranny than any other instance in America's political history.	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/5f0feq/cmv_a_political_system_of_at_least_two/	"Everything that exists in the universe exists because of an equal-and-opposite force/idea. Disagreement is equally as important as agreement.

The left's rhetoric is centered around misleading certain people(SJWs) that everyone should think and feel how they do and if they don't then they're a bigot and should be demonized...doesn't this sound like tyranny, not free speech? 

Everyone's taught to think by 'demonizing' things. It could be anything from an outcome in life, people group, or behavior. There's no way around that because it's how society is still alive. **There's a significant difference between being silenced by facts of reality and being silenced from being demonized by others, because these facts we learn about reality are where our ideals come from** - not from one person's feelings or a group's feelings which are inherently selfish and greedy.

Over the past decade or two, the left's rhetoric has divisively fed the weaknesses of minorities and millennials. You can see examples of this from the latter stages of the Clinton campaign when they used rich celebrities like Katy Perry, Jayz, and Beyonce to appeal to a generation who've practically been bred to follow whatever feeds their attention alone, and I personally find that move disgusting. You'll see that same trend in the media, which majorly fucked up this election. The media executives obviously saw their influence in jeopardy if an outsider won the presidency, and the perception of every individual easily becomes the single most important asset of for a media organization.

tl;dr **Having a system that is united in feelings alone and not by known ideals is how enormous blind spots form in people's perceptions, and these blind spots are where tyranny and slavery grow.**

* ""We do not want any other god than Germany itself. It is essential to have fanatical faith and hope and love in and for Germany."" ~Adolf Hitler, (Heiden, Konrad (1935). A History of National Socialism. A.A. Knopf, p. 100.)
* ""Fascism is a religious conception in which man is seen in his immanent relationship with a superior law and with an objective Will that transcends the particular individual and raises him to conscious membership in a spiritual society."" ~Benito Mussolini, *Doctrine of Fascism*, i. 5, 1932

Nationalism and religion alike cause international conflicts to fracture upon similar lines. Sometimes, like in the Balkans and Northern Ireland, nationalism and religion are one and the same. Is this a coincidence?

Shayne Singleton produced [this excellent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRvkTXb1dxU) on why nationalism is a religion, and just as dangerous any any other. In it, he cites Ernest Becker's excellent book *The Denial of Death"". The central thesis is that nationalism is way to subscribe to a group dynamic that lives into an indefinite future. In other words, nationalism is a faith.

Next, let's consider statements in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgvtBc35-NE) by Albert Ehrlichmann, a self-described nationalist:

* ""I think that Europe should be for Europeans, Africa should be for Africans, etc.""
* ""While whites might be a majority in our own countries, soon enough we won't be.""
* ""We are already a minority on a global scale.""
* ""I focus on Europeans because they're my people, and they're also the most threatened at the moment.""

All of these statements are faith-based, not fact-based. Erlichmann doesn't define what a European is, nor who is white. For example, he cites that Turks kept white slaves while at the same time not acknowledging that a portion of Turkey actually sits in Europe. 

There's also some historical revisionism at work. For a large amount of time, Celts, Slavs, and Southern Europeans like Italians and Spanish were considered separate races. Even now there's disagreement on who is white. With racial identification used by the US government, North Africans and Middle Easterners are considered white -- even though those geographic regions are not in Europe. Many Americans would disagree with that assessment.

So what would cause someone to become a nationalist if they're not persuaded by facts? Religion, and not necessarily religion in the traditional sense, but in the sense that adherence to a nation or ethnicity is a religion itself. Hitler knew this. Mussolini knew this. 

Nationalism is faith based on the intrinsic goodness of the national in-group. Hence, it's a religion.

Original post:

A recent [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/5jd9a7/unthinkable_today_obvious_tomorrow_the_moral_case/) in /r/philosophy was locked because its discussion was only ""tangentially connected"".  

I am of the opinion that:

1. /r/all tends to bring conversation from users not necessarily familiar with a subreddit or its rules.
2. Comments from /r/all, while potentially against the rules of *that subreddit*, need-not be moderated with such urgency if they follow reddiquette.
3. Subreddits allowing their posts to reach /r/all are implicitly assuming the responsibility of regulating these posts (within 'normal' /r/all traffic).

It therefore makes sense to either:

* add more moderators to compensate for expected traffic
* remove the subreddit from /r/all eligibility
* temporarily prioritize reddiquette over subreddit-rules if expected traffic is exceeded.  "	68	22

We've got Trump, who is unlikely to start attending his intelligence briefings daily even after he takes office. This could result in him being unable to prevent a 9/11-scale terrorist attack.

Republicans control the government at ALL levels. So far, it's mostly kumbaya between Trump and the GOP Congress, which is understandable given that they don't want to blow their majority. And this is unlikely to change anytime soon, since the Republicans defend 8 Senate seats up for reelection in 2018 as opposed to Democrats' 25. It's not inconceivable that they could reach a filibuster-proof 60.

As for the Cabinet, don't even get me started. He's gotta be choosing the worst people for those jobs ON PURPOSE. Rick Perry couldn't remember anything about the Department Of Energy other than the fact that he wanted to get rid of it. He'll probably choose some billionaire demagogue for the agency responsible for tracking pandemics, and then we're gonna fall like dominoes when, not IF, one hits.

Hillary Clinton is stating his intention to run again in four years. We already know she can't win, so what's the point? In fact, I support her being imprisoned if only because then she won't be running in 2020, and then some other Democrat might have a chance.

As for the Supreme Court, Republicans abused their filibuster to ensure Obama couldn't appoint Garland and so they could steal a seat on the Supreme Court. While this first appointment won't make a difference since Scalia was a conservative, Ginsburg is likely to die or retire within the next few years, since she's 83 and has had cancer twice. And Congress is too scared to stand up to Trump.

Finally, we are seeing autocracy at the state level already. North Carolina's GOP is stripping the Democratic governor of his powers, and political scientists no longer consider the Tar Heel State a democracy. What might my own state of Massachusetts become?

And, REALLY finally, don't forget that if past pattern is any indication, Trump is only going to release information through Tweets, which are limited to 140 characters. He seems to want a nuclear arms race, and praises Putin as a strong leader. If he adopts Putin's policies, America is over.

In conclusion, I think that Donald Trump is a very real threat to America as we know it. Let's see if you can CMV!

For example quota based systems (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regents_of_the_University_of_California_v._Bakke) or explicit points based systems  ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratz_v._Bollinger ). However other types of affirmative action are allowed. The most common type is that the college claims to ""holistically evaluate each candidate and take many factors into account including diversity"". My view is that taking race into account as part of a holistic evaluation is just a weasely way to impose a quota and thus it's silly to oppose quotas and support this holistic affirmative action. 


Both quotas and holistic affirmative action have the same net effect when compared to race blind admissions. Some white and many Asian students who would have been accepted are instead rejected and some black students who would have been rejected are instead accepted. Why does it matter what process was used to achieve this goal if it ends with the same students being accepted and rejected?

I understand that from a legal perspective these holistic programs are harder to attack because it's very difficult to prove that any specific student was rejected because of them but I don't see this ascac reason to actually support such programs. They are violating the spirit of equal protection even if they don't violate the letter of the law.

With our collective thought, we have been able to innovate, create and develop into an ever increasing more sophisticated society. 

I believe that higher education will be needed less as it will no longer produce enough monetary benefit. We are seeing this already with people able to find information that they need through big data (internet, collection of all scientific papers for easy access, etc). Skills that were specialised for employment are often now attainable over the internet. Many of these skills are no longer needed to be mastered but followed until the job is completed and then forgotten. I point to the woman who built her house with information off the internet as an example (yes a big one but still driving home a point). She is a writer and will continue to write, not build houses. 

When automation and big data become common in our lives I contend that education after high school will not be needed. I do believe our high schools will need to change into teaching people how to teach themselves, but I'll save that one for another day.

I believe it is unfair of people to criticise Obama for being technically at war within the whole two terms of his presidency. I doubt this was either his desire or intention and where possible it is evident to me that he tried hard to limit American involvement as much as possible. 

I will be clear that my knowledge of all of the events that directly led to conflict between the US and sections of the Middle East is fragmented. However what I do know is that Obama inherited an already complex and expensive war in Afghanistan from the Bush administration. Obama was successful in trying to pull back the number of forces going over to Afghanistan and losing their lives, despite it being admitted by military analyst Stephen Biddle that the war: ""can only be sustained if the U.S. Congress keeps writing multibillion-dollar-a-year checks to keep the Afghan National Security Forces in the field."" In this case it is not difficult to see a complete pull out of US forces here leading to the Afghan security forces collapsing against the Taliban. 

Furthermore, in the war against IS Obama's strategy was quite clearly to use tactical air strikes on key IS targets as opposed to 'boots on the ground'. In his own words this has led to IS losing key territory and helped bolster existing Iraqi forces to take charge of their own efforts to combat IS, rather than endanger existing American lives. Perhaps the biggest criticism I can level against Obama here is that there has not been enough American military involvement. The fight has been long, expensive and slow but the reaction of people I have seen on social media has been that the fight should have been harder. Possibly with American troops on the ground. 

I am no fortune teller but it is obvious to me that had Obama taken that approach, America would probably have been in an even worse position. More American lives lost, more blood shed, more expense and more outcry. 

To change my view I would like someone to explain to me realistically what else Obama could have done to bring the conflict to an end without furthering direct military involvement. Trump said remarkably little about this during the elections other than that he would 'bomb the hell out of IS' so now that the war is his, would a reasonable action for him to send American troops over ASAP and risk getting America in another full scale war? I doubt anyone wants that.

From the client's perspective, they know that they are being charged based on how much time the lawyer spends on the case. This may sometimes deter the client from calling the lawyer and asking questions, for better and for worse. 

But I'm focused more on the lawyer perspective than the client perspective. Most associate lawyers (aka guys who work at the firm but don't own it) have a minimum number of billable hours they have to hit to keep their job. 

Of course, time spent working doesn't always correlate directly to billable hours. I might have a form contract that took me 2 hours to make, but that I can reuse for each case, and charge 1 hour of billable work for the 5 minutes it took me to change the names on the form. On the flip side, I might have to spend an extra half hour looking through the case folder for a document, but can't charge at all for that half hour because it's not ""billable work.""

I think this incentives attorneys to spend their time in ways that are not always most productive to doing good legal work. As a lawyer, I am essentially incentivized to do no more work on a case than I can bill for, even if that case might benefit from an extra 2 hours of research. I am at the same time incentivized to sometimes do extra work on another case that is ""riper"" for billable hours. 

On top of all that, my boss is largely assessing my performance based on how much busy work I complete, instead of how well I do the work.

I concede that it's hard to think of a better system. If you come to me with a large employment dispute, I can't know how much work that will entail. If I charge a flat fee, and the case ends up entailing much more work than other cases that I get a similar fee for, I as a lawyer got ripped off. Conversely if it's way less work, the client is ripped off. Billable hours does ensure the billing is theoretically proportionate to the work done. 

However, I think most lawyers can decently estimate the cost/value of a case before they take it on. A switch to a universal flat fee system would require the lawyer and client to do more vetting to determine price before taking a case, but I think that would be a positive exchange to eliminate all the pitfalls of the billable system.

To think that you can become a gender outside of the standard binaries is baffling to me. Gender aligns directly with the genitals you possess and your Sex that correlates. Transgender people go from one gender to the other with reassignment surgeries, etc. due to Gender Dysphoria that has been diagnosed upon them. 

People who become Transgender and claim to Non-Binary Genders without any diagnosis and feelings that come from it, makes me believe they are doing it for the sake of doing it. 

It's harmful to the Transgender  Community to identify as a Non-Binary gender and act as if it is legitimate. It presents a warped perception of their actual struggles and feelings that come from actual Transgender people. 

*(Sorry for any mistakes, writing on phone.)*

**Edit:**
I've seen Trans people speak against these people as it's delegitimizing the movement and struggles they face. They act in a way as if they're struggles are the same, but they aren't. People who claim to Non-Binary Genders aren't helping their movement by claiming to fictional ideas that haven't been scientifically or medically proven to exist. It causes so much confusion for those trying to understand the Transgender community when they see these kind of people. That's why I hold this belief as its harmful and has caused a stigma against trans people. I want to see the rights and lives of Trans People improve, but I don't think this will happen if these people keep doing what they do. "	22	61	
changemyview	t3_5upo1b	https://www.reddit.com//r/changemyview/comments/5upo1b/cmv_humans_cannot_distinguish_inherent_value_and/	2017-02-18 00:11:34	LysergicChemist	CMV: Humans cannot distinguish 'inherent value', and the phrase should be deleted from philosophy.	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/5upo1b/cmv_humans_cannot_distinguish_inherent_value_and/	"My view is that inherent value does not exist in the philosophical sense. There is no way to separate mortal human interests from that which can be regarded to have inherent value.

Furthermore, it is impossible to agree on which non-human matter has inherent value. Instead, discussions involving the idea of 'inherent value' inevitably boil down to accepting the basic needs of our species, and are otherwise philosophically useless conceptions of 'inherent'.

Philosophical reasoning is not efficient on the basis that say, our planet, has inherent value. As long as there is no way to prove that Earth has inherent value, the idea of value being inherent to the valuable is impossible. Finally, anything of non-binary 'value' is only valuable as insisted by human language. CMV

LMK if I should evaluate in the comments on anything, thanks for reading!


---------------------------------------------------------------

I just don't see 'valuable' descriptively different from 'inherently valuable', even in the case of abstract concepts. 

In each case, humans are placing arbitrary value in ordinance to their own interests. I think we could have a discussion about the value of happiness without use of the word 'inherent' or 'intrinsic' once, and the communication would be philosophically equal, if not better.


We could cite chemical and social effects of happiness, we could even say that it is the pinnacle of human existence. To me, this doesn't justify using the phrase 'inherently valuable', because humans are necessary to both experience or even conceptualize happiness.


I mean consider the extent you agree with each:


- human life is inherently valuable
- human life is intrinsically valuable
- human life is valuable


These are equal philosophical statements, in my eyes. They all describe humanism, the 'i' words just complicate the discussion, and hide anthropocentrism further behind the language.


-----------------------------------------------

[given valuable (screwdriver)] has value in that it exists and is not arbitrary. It has physical value in that it could be used to grip a screw or jab someone's eye (good vs bad intent). The only inherent value that the screwdriver has is its physical properties. These properties are entirely irrelevant to moral philosophy.


There is no moral distinction between a phillips head and a flat head screwdriver, only a functional or physical difference. So saying that screwdrivers are inherently valuable because humans can use them as tools, to me complicates the issue and doesn't even address their actual inherent value , which is that one is compatible with a certain type of screw that the other is not. See what I am getting at?


I don't see the word 'inherent' as useful in philosophy. The amazing minds and bodies of texts behind inherent vs instrumental value failing to agree on that which is inherently valuable, also supports my view. Straight up, there is no universal, and therefore philosophically/epistemologically useful, definition of the phrase 'inherent value'.

changemyview	t3_5xqskj	https://www.reddit.com//r/changemyview/comments/5xqskj/cmv_trumps_north_american_immigration_policy_is/	2017-03-06 02:39:12	UrbanIsACommunist	CMV: Trump's North American immigration policy is not unreasonable in general	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/5xqskj/cmv_trumps_north_american_immigration_policy_is/	"There are currently ~310 million U.S. citizens. However, millions, perhaps billions, of people across the planet would want nothing more than to come and live/work in the U.S. I've walked through the slums of the Philippines, where people live without running water, in poorly constructed and disheveled shanties. Every morning in Cebu City, hundreds of people line up outside the U.S. consulate at 3am--hoping, praying, to be able to apply for a visa to come to the U.S. 99% of them don't get one. The situation is infinitely worse in India, which has a population 15 times that of the Philippines. And don't even get me started about the 1 billion people living in even worse conditions in sub-Saharan Africa.

My point is this: given the incredible number of people who would give anything to live/work in the U.S., how do we decide who gets in and who doesn't? Oftentimes I feel like ""pro-immigration"" advocates never draw any clear boundaries--it's as if we should just let *everyone* in. Because after all, who are we to deny someone from another country a chance at a better life, as we live our privileged lives in the ivory tower of the U.S.? Of course, that's not a viable option. The U.S. economy and government would fall apart if we suddenly let in hundreds of millions of immigrants. It's truly amazing how the U.S. has been able to sustain such high levels of immigration throughout its history. Even so, pro-immigration advocates too often forget that U.S. immigration policy has hardly been one of open arms. The early 1900s saw a huge increase in targeted immigration restrictions, the most infamous being the Chinese Exclusion Act, which barred Chinese immigration for nearly 30 years. Significant restrictions were placed on Italian, Slavic, and Jewish immigrants as well.

One thing I find ironic is that Mexican illegals have been able to take advantage of their ""geographical privilege"" in a way that someone living in the slums of India cannot--yet this is almost never brought up during discussions on Mexican immigration. While painful in the short term, deporting illegal immigrants and building a border wall is the only way for the U.S. to properly control, optimize, and enforce its immigration policy, and make it fair such that someone from India/Africa/Southeast Asia has as good of a chance of making it into the U.S. as someone from Mexico.

Let me be clear--I am not anti-immigration in general. My grandparents on my father's side both immigrated to the U.S. from Poland shortly after WWII. My two great-grandfathers fought with the Polish Free Army alongside American and British troops at Monte Cassino. Shortly after the war, Congress passed a bill allowing Polish families who had fought with the Allied forces to immigrate to the U.S. They went through lawful immigration processing at JFK. In this case, there were clear stipulations that were put in place by Congress, and the government had the opportunity to clearly document and monitor immigration activity. This is a far cry from someone crossing the border without a visa, living under the radar in the U.S. for an extended period of time, and then complaining when they're finally caught.

People often argue that deporting illegal aliens who have lived in the U.S. for an extended period of time is inhumane because it ruins the lives of the aliens &amp; their families. But consider an analogy: a retail salesmen makes 40k a year, has 3 children, and wants to send them to a top private college on the east coast. He embezzles hundreds of thousands over the course of a decade and all his children are able to enroll in said elite college. Halfway through their degrees, the company discovers the embezzlement, the man goes to jail, and his assets are frozen. His children cannot pay tuition and are forced to drop out. Did the man do anything wrong in this case? He was simply hoping for a better life for his children. The company was doing fine even with the minor loss in revenue. Should the man be convicted? Should the children be allowed to continue their education? Suppose they weren't even aware of their father's illegal activities.

My opinion is that lately, the West is realizing that mass immigration is not a viable solution to ending global poverty and healing regions torn apart by conflict. The socialistic utopias of Scandinavia and Europe have lived in their own little post-WWII bubbles, where 95% of the population was ethnically and racially homogenous. People in the U.S. point to these countries as the sort of welfare states we should aspire to be. But *of course* living standards there are great--they haven't had to deal with the cultural strife conflicts that necessarily occur when you put different social/ethnic/religious/etc. groups under one government. At the beginning of the refugee crisis, Europe thought the humanitarian approach was the best solution. Now they've realized this whole immigration thing isn't as easy as they thought it would be. Due to immigration pressure, Sweden closed its border with Denmark for the first time ever, and in turn, Denmark closed its border with Germany. Now Germany is restricting its immigration policies too. 

Letting these people in takes away the best and brightest from underdeveloped countries across the globe and only perpetuates the problem, which is that the undeveloped world needs to get its shit together. Take for instance, China. Hundreds of millions of Chinese live in shit conditions making cheap products for China to sell to America. The Chinese government and business class like this situation, because it has made them incredibly rich. They perpetuate the situation by devaluing their currency and promoting an export-based economy where the wages of Chinese workers barely allow them to sustain themselves and their families. This same sort of scenario is echoed all across the second/third world (i.e. corrupt governments suppressing a free market in terms of labor/capital through the use of force). And don't even try to argue that the U.S. is just as corrupt/terrible as the second/third world. The U.S. is the envy of the world because in spite of our enormous/diverse population, the median family can achieve a relatively high amount of wealth. When you look at PPP-adjusted median household income, the U.S. is on par with Denmark (in all its lovely, socialist utopian glory).

In summary: Trump's immigration policy (i.e. border wall, deportation) is actually beneficial because it will allow the U.S. government to properly control and optimize a very complex situation. Allowing illegals to stay in the U.S. is emotionally satisfying but is not based on any sort of rational argument as to how to improve the livelihoods of non-U.S. citizens. The U.S. should strive for geographical parity in its immigration policy (i.e. an Indian has as good a chance as a Mexican as making it in the U.S.). The U.S. should first and foremost consider *why* Mexico's wealth is so inferior compared to say, Canada, and work with the Mexican government (despite the inevitable resistance by the Mexican elite) to foster an economy that can provide adequate opportunities for social and economic progress.

Personally I've got nothing against any religion. There may or may not be a God, but to me, expecting them to be the way they're written in holy books created by man is like expecting aliens to look like little green men with oval heads and huge eyes.

Elections start next week in the Netherlands and Wilders is ahead. With Trump, I could understand people were upset with the way things were going, especially for middle America, and a swing to the Republicans after 2 terms of Democrats was all but inevitable. However, Wilders campaigns on an openly anti-Islam message. Le Pen in France, while similar, at least talks about 'French nationalism' to try to make herself more palatable. A lot of populists across Europe aren't even hiding behind dog whistles like 'law and order', 'x-ish values' or 'taking control' anymore. 

Obviously these things can't be talked about face to face in the current climate. But those who are willing to talk sometimes say a liberal country needs a liberal population, and if overwhelmed by 'illiberal' Muslims, it can lose its identity and become theocratic. However, the majority of the [4-6%](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/19/5-facts-about-the-muslim-population-in-europe/) of Muslims in Western Europe pre-9/11 would have lived quiet lives in the West, like Buddhists and Sikhs live now. 

I would prefer to talk rather than be bombarded with news stories of Muslims doing this or refugees doing that. Someone looking for self-affirmation can easily search for information that backs up their beliefs. What I want to know is the core of the belief. Friends tell me Muslims are different, but a [quick search](http://theamericanmuslim.org/tam.php/features/articles/comparison-propaganda/0019178) shows that the language of Islamophobia has similarities to antisemitism. Especially about the scriptures telling the believers to kill non-believers. Maybe I'm guilty of self-affirmation, and maybe you'll think the source is biased, but I think millions of Muslims are just decent working people. 

Death by terrorism is over-represented, hence why it works. If people were as afraid of dying by something more statistically likely like a car crash than by a terrorist, they would never leave the house. Muslims may commit more acts of terror, but they're being attributed to a handful of terror cells. If 10 IS soldiers kill 300 people, then blaming Muslims as a whole would be like blaming all Republicans for the IRA movement.

By support, I mean support a legal institution of marriage between same sex couples, and support of a legal institution of marriage between more than two partners.

I thought I'd also clarify my own views on the matter. They're both things I wouldn't do myself. And, I don't think the state should be in the business of marriage in any form.

*Why:*

I was thinking about polygamy, and gay marriage, and realized I couldn't think of a single argument I've heard for gay marriage that doesn't apply to polygamy. The most notable among them being the base case that just because you think something is wrong, doesn't mean that you can enforce your worldview on others.

And just because a couple of vampires committed some ugly murders does *not* mean that *all* vampires are murderers!

(As a side note, there are already companies producing blood substitutes such as Tru Blood, so there is no issue of vampires viewing humans as a necessary food source.  Grow up!)

The majority of the American population (and around the world, really, but I'm coming at this issue from an American POV) is fairly comfortable in their social lives and hardly ever comes in contact with any vampires.  Even if they do, most people don't recognize that they've met a vampire, because they have the ability to ""pass"" in mortal society.  That ability to pass as human scares a lot of conservatives.

A substantial portion of the voting public actually sees vampires as a threat to society *just because they are vampires!*  This is the very definition of discrimination.  Some vampires may lash out occasionally because they are rejected by mortal society and are kept at arm's length, or even ostracized by their neighbors.

Instead, we should embrace vampires and list them among the minority groups to whom we give legal protection.  CMV."	9	29

It's no secret at this point that money buys political influence in America and I can't see that changing anytime soon. For now things are okay because the rich need the poor to generate wealth for them, but automation will change this. There will be a large portion of the population who are poor, unskilled, and incapable of creating value for companies. Even as the need for a greater social safety net and universal basic income become blatantly obvious, business interests and the rich will ensure that this does not happen. Any resistance the poor may put up due to not being able to afford food, healthcare, and other necessities would quickly be crushed with automated security systems. In other civil rights movements, the poor putting financial pressure on businesses to change their stances played a key role, now it will be impossible. The law and more advanced technology will protect the wealthy from any financial consequences of their cruelty. Private prison companies will continue to successfully lobby for more policies to imprison the poor, taking away their right to any remaining political power they had in the process. The 1% (super rich) and the 14% (well off) will live out their lives in a utopian society driven by automation while everyone else gets by on inadequate government programs or works the few shitty remaining low level jobs that have not been automated, slaves to the rich that they will view much like their machines. I see this as the endgame in an America where money has such a powerful influence over politics.

Here's his wiki bio: 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_LaFontaine

He unfortunately passed away in 2008.

I can't remember the last time I heard a voice-over narration in a trailer (that was taken from dialogue that *wasn't* from the film). And it makes no sense for these companies to *not* use voice-overs. Otherwise, you're stuck with only the dialogue in the film that has to be cut together to fit into a short trailer, where it may not make any sense. Or, you're left using up all the good jokes/lines from the film in order to ""sell"" your movie and get ""asses in the seats"", as trailer-cutting houses like to say. And often times, movie studios are *adding* clunky dialogue into films that may not even sound that good, but they need to include it so they can ""put it in the trailer."" They should have voice-overs for that!

Lastly, in the section of the trailer where they would normally have some voice-over by Don LaFontaine, they've pretty much just replaced it with the **BBBRRRAAAAMMMMMMM** sound effect that we're all getting ridiculously tired of (Case in point: [World War Z Trailer).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcwTxRuq-uk)

But that's a shitty solution, and it's one of (if not *the*) biggest reasons why trailers suck these days. I haven't heard anyone else talk about this on /r/videos or /r/movies, so I figured I would discuss it here.

Here's some examples of Don LaFontaine's best movie trailers:

* Starship Troopers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCB8Uz0dY58

* South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbMl6DjhJ1I

* Home Alone: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK2Btk6Ybm0

* First Blood: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAqLKlxY3Eo

* Ace Venture: When Nature Calls: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A99O84ct-WM

* And one of my favorite Don LaFontaine commercials: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJMGS7l0wT8

And some recent examples (some have voice-over's, but it's pulled from dialogue within the film):

* Terminator Salvation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3p6GHSWDScM

* The Avengers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOrNdBpGMv8

* Jurassic World: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFinNxS5KN4

However, I can't help but see that as a negative side effect of full liberty, because inevitably it just leads to more people getting hurt. That's the numbers talking.

Yes, cars also kill people, but I don't need a gun to get to work. The benefits of having cars in society vastly outweight the drawbacks. With guns, the only benefits arise when a really tough intruder is in my house or when the government is trying to oppress me. In the UK we still manage to survive a break in without shooting everything in sight, and if the government came after us, they'd likely win even if we had a gun.

Leaving out the political points, I beg to differ.

I'm basically going by what Kant says:
By far, the largest part of society prefers to think for themselves as little as possible. Critical thinking is demanding, unpleasant and requires you to concern yourself with the topic. Adopting someone elses point that they have already thought through (more or less) is much easier, so most people will just pick out a view that best fits their morals and call it a day.

Keeping that in mind, what will a revolution truly achieve? Nothing much, in the intellectual sense. You might experience a political shift, a decrease in oppression, but the way of thought will never change.
New prejudices will inevitable replace the ones your revolution got rid of and these new prejudices will be the principle after which the great masses will behave and condemn.

Through revolution, you cannot make the masses think for themselves, a revolution or politicking will never change the way people think, you will merely alter the topic of their (few) thoughts.

To change your society for the better, you will need to change the way of thought, maybe through the process of enlightenment, maybe through some other means. CMV.

I believe no such laws should be on the books.

**Argument 1: Proportionality**

1. If someone does you an injustice, your response must be proportional to the crime. 

For instance, if a classmate steals your pencil, that doesn't give you the right to break their arm. A proportional response would be to report them to be sent to detention, take your pencil back, or take something of theirs. This is because responses to injustices are usually only done for a few possible reasons: to mitigate the harm of the act, to deter or prevent future such acts, or to balance out the scales of moral harm (""revenge""). Anything beyond this creates a *new* injustice which then must be responded to in turn (this is how blood feuds used to develop).

2. There is no injustice worse than killing someone.

Ending a person's life is final. It is unlike any other way you can hurt someone, because there is no recovering from it, not even a partial recovery. By ending a person's life you have taken everything away from them. 

3. Therefore, the only way killing someone would be a proportional response would be if they killed someone first. The government, even where the death penalty is legal, typically will not execute someone for anything short of murder. Therefore, why would it be justified for a private citizen to do so?

**Argument 2: Outcome Comparison**

This is a completely different argument than the above, but I think it works as well, if not better.

Let's say you are faced with two outcomes. Scenario A, you have escaped safely and your attacker is alive, but you have lost something short of grievous bodily harm, such as your property, your place in line, or suffered some emotional harm. Scenario B, you are also safe and you have not lost any property, space, or suffered emotional harm, but your attacker is dead. 

Scenario A is always better than Scenario B because the harms of killing someone, even a robber or aggressive attacker, always outweigh the harms prevented by theft of property, invasion of space, or emotional harm. None of those things can compare in grief to a person dying.

Note this argument still allows you to kill your attacker if you have no option to retreat, but you have a duty to retreat first if you can.

===

In conclusion, I can see no situation where killing someone is justified simply in the name of keeping property or standing your ground on a piece of land, even if it is on your own property. Can you change my view?

There is a sort of new group of people online called ""virtuous pedophiles."" Who are people who

1. Are only sexually attracted to children
2. DO NOT act on it in person
3. DO NOT watch live (actual kids) child porn
4. Did not choose this disorder or ""orientation""
5. Actively avoid children
6. People seeking professional help.

To me, if they are abiding the law and not in any way harming children, I think they should be viewed less through pure vitriolic hatred and more with a desire to help.

Keep in mind: I WOULD NEVER TAKE CHANCES WITH MY KIDS AROUND THEM.  And other people who wouldn't are completely understandable.

But I'm talking about HATING them. I just don't understand it. 

Virtuous pedophiles will never have a normal functioning romantic life, will always be hated, and will always be feared. Can't we just be more rational in how we approach them? Why the hate?

** I will not answer any response that just say ""this is libtard sjw propaganda"" or ""your a piece of shit and disgusting"" etc.. **

A problem. It's supposedly a religion of peace that (like most religions) fail to actually fulfill its promises. A man named William Gladstone said it best. ""As long as there is this book. There will be no peace in the world"".

Although Islam once brought amazing mathematical wonders, architecture, art and works of fantasy to the world. In the last 300 years the religion had become an anchor. Limiting and preventing self expression. Banning things like dancing and almost all songs that aren't about Islam. 

 [A list of things Islam bans. ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/2y1u9n/list_of_things_muslims_consider_forbidden_haram/)

[A more comprehensive List](http://navedz.com/the-70-major-sins-forbidden-in-islam/)

Islamic nations fail to catch up to the creativity, art and scientific wonders of modern society even though at one point they were beating the West. 

Islam strips people of their rights as we can see in almost every Islam majority state. It impresses women and as of recently been the poster child of terrorism. Islam is an authoritarian religion that demands compliance and obedience. It is degenerative to both society and culture.  

If Islam as a religion died suddenly, there would be less terrorism. More rights for women. More freedom of expression and more rights for people in general. 

So, CMV that Islam is subtractive to culture. "	5	103

I can't speak for the rest of the world, but where I live adult bikers are required by law to ride in the street about 1 meter from the curb, on the right side of the street and follow the same traffic laws as cars. My city does actually enforce these laws on bikers.

This for me doesn't make sense and in my experience is more dangerous than if we were just allowed to ride on the sidewalk and followed the same rules as pedestrians. Here are my reasons:

- In the event of an accident, someone is a lot more likely to get severely injured or even die if it involves a bike and a car as opposed to a bike and a pedestrian.

- Larger vehicles such as buses or trucks can be extremely startling when passing on the same lane.

- On major roads, the speed of a car is significantly higher than that of a bike, which causes cars to fly by and get very upset if they are unfortunate enough to land behind you in a position they can't pass. Every other day I hear someone in a car yelling at me to get off the street, even though I am always as close to the curb as I can be. 

- Don't even get me on lanes where another road merges in([like this](http://pad2.whstatic.com/images/thumb/b/b0/Merge-Onto-the-Highway-Without-Crashing-Step-7-preview.jpg/aid17526-v4-728px-Merge-Onto-the-Highway-Without-Crashing-Step-7-preview.jpg)), people seem to aggressively go in without looking or yielding like they are supposed to, and to be fair, in some circumstances it may be difficult to even see the bike. Not to mention that in some of these cases you then have to try to get to the new right lane, while people behind you are freaking out that you are in their way and the ones coming from the right simple ignore or don't see you.
Seriously... In my path there is one of these and to make matters even worse, it is uphill.

- Attempting to go on the left side of the street to do a left turn is a bloody nightmare! It is like playing Frogger in real life, not to mention that once you do make your turns, it is a whole other adventure trying to get back to the right.

- The number of pedestrians is usually significantly lower than cars on the streets. Where I bike through there may be full blown traffic jams without a single person walking. It almost feels like a waste not to just use the sidewalks at times.

The bottom line is, personally I would feel much safer if I could just use the damn sidewalk and don't quite understand why I have to use the road. Perhaps a solution to this would be bikers being allowed to ride on the sidewalk as long as it's under a certain speed? Anyway, that isn't even the case where I live.

So anyway, those are my reasons. Do your magic and CMV!

When you are thinking silently to yourself, you are thinking using words. Even now, as you read this post, I am transferring thoughts from my brain into yours by using words. That being said, trying to tell someone which words they can or cannot use, or trying to control their use of language is like trying to control how they think.

Let's avoid the transgender topic for a sec, and let's think of a different scenario. Imagine you are sitting at a bar, having a drink with a few friends, when a guy pulls up on a big, loud, motorcycle. A Harley, or a chopper, (I don't know bikes) and this guy looks like your stereo-typical biker. He's got the leather vest, the bandana on his head, sleeves of tattoos, a chain hanging from his back-pocket, and this guy comes walking into the bar, swinging his shoulders, thinking he's the meanest, toughest sumbitch that ever stepped foot in that bar.

What sort of thoughts would you have about that particular individual? They could range from: 

""Oh he looks tough. Don't fuck with him!"" 

to: 

""Pfft... dude looks like a pussy. He's a poser hiding behind his tattoos."" 

But no matter what your opinion of the biker is, and no matter how different it might be from his own opinion of himself, he does not get a vote. He does not get to decide what you think of him. All he can do, is present himself however he chooses, and let everyone else form their own opinion of him. 

Imagine how ridiculous it would seem if this biker tried to demand that people refer to him in a specific way. If I said to him:

""You look like a pussy.""

and he responded with:

""No! I'm a badass! And you have to refer to me as a badass! Stop oppressing me!""

If he did that, no one would take him seriously. Right?

I want to clear the air a bit (because I know I'll get backlash for this) and say that I have no problem with transgendered people. If a boy/man decides that his secret to happiness is by dressing like a woman, acting like a woman, and generally living like a woman in every way, then by all means, go for it. Gender norms are a societal idea, and we are under no obligation to follow them. But just because he sees himself as a woman, doesn't mean that I do. And when in contact with transgendered people, I will choose to use whatever pronoun I see fit, because the image of that individual in my head is determined by my own interpretation, not by their wishes.

TL;DR: Everyone has the right to present themselves however they choose. But **no one** has the right to decide how others perceive them."	23	370

I know when I've acted while drunk I knew what I was doing at the time. 


Not thinking in the same way doesn't mean you don't consent. Some people just naturally have a lower psychical requirement for sex. Does that mean they should never legally be allowed to have sex? Having that level of consideration doesn't mean you don't consent. 

Obviously being  semi-unconscious means you can't consent, but that's a different thing. 

IMO, semi-unconsciousness should be the line. 

Sex while drunk is fine. I don't always like what I do when drunk, but it's generally me doing something weird.

That puts both the person and the dog in danger.

Also, not all dogs are friendly to all other dogs, and a dog off leash might get them angry and a fight would begin.

There is no way for an unfamiliar person to tell whether the dog he sees is friendly or not and whether it has been vaccinated or not, so for whoever encounters a dog off leash there is no actual difference between an owned dog and a stray dog. So I believe that for all matters, legal included, a dog off leash in leash-only places should be considered a stray dog. CMV!

When this happens, the intricate, complicated society we’ve developed is going to be in trouble. Money will no longer be made in the same way. It will be meaningless. We’re going to have to figure out a way to preserve what we’ve built up. At the same time, it will be an opportunity to improve on the negative aspects of society. 

Some assumptions:

Capitalism fails with full automation. i don't know if it will, you know as much as i do. let's pretend.

Money fails without capitalism. this seems obvious but many people don't think so. 



Here’s my suggestion for the replacement of money: we embrace the class system in the US and attach to it a very vibrant set of rules to go along with it. These rules will allow people to understand how to move up in classes as well as, maybe more importantly, when you will sink to a lower class. I don’t have all the rules figured out, of course, but hopefully I can present enough to give you an idea of where I’m coming from. 


I don’t know how to make it happen or who will pay for it or any of those other pressing questions. What I’m suggesting is a new way of life like capitalism or communism, something to help us survive the upcoming automation revolution. Yes it’s probably just a pipe dream. Let’s talk about the merits of it rather than how likely it is to happen. It’s not bloody likely. 


First of all, people should be allowed to go down the rung of the caste system whenever they want to. Providing the conditions that allow them a higher class still exist they should be able to go back to the previous class level whenever they want to based on a system of credits. Everyone knows why you’d want to move up but why would anyone want to go down to a lower class?


First let’s look at the bad things about being in the highest classes right now in the US. 


**Increased Scrutiny**

This one is obvious. You fuck up when you’re in the lowest class, likely no one is even going to find out. Find yourself in a drug den in some ghetto, no one will even recognize you. The richer you are, the more famous, the more you have to be careful about everything you do. Paparazzi, autograph seekers, looky-loos, the press, former friends and lovers writing tell-all books, television entertainment shows are all keen to catch you doing something wrong. 


**You’re fair game for fair use**

All sorts of things might be said about you. You and your family might appear in sketch shows like Saturday night live. Cartoons might make fun of you and the way you look leaving you with no recourse. You can’t sue if they impinge your reputation. 


**Everyone wants some**

Every winner of the lottery understands this only too well. You can’t even really easily make friends any more. Do they want to be friends with you just for some of your money? Are they just star-fuckers? Are they hoping to be associated with your fame? 


**You’re held to a higher standard**

Everyone expects more from you. You should tip more. You should be an example to other people. Try yelling at some asshole in starbucks that fucks up your name. Similar to increased scrutiny, this is the natural judgmental progression of it. 

There’s probably more but this is enough for now. 


**Benefits of a higher caste**

We don’t have to list these. We all know these. We can come up with tiers wherein you get better service at restaurants, better seats, better food, more respect, different titles and salutations. You can wear better clothing, ride in nicer cars get better service on planes, live in nicer and nicer houses with better views. You can get waited on by servants, dressed by them even. Each tier comes with better stuff but the corresponding bad traits that go along with fame as well. The only difference is in this system the things would be *non negotiable*. You have to accept all that goes with that new class or opt for a lower one.


**How to move up in class**

We will have to replicate the money-based system we have today. We can bank class credits instead of money. If you have a skill that is valuable, whatever that might turn out to be, and you use it, you get credits that you can trade in to move up in caste. You can bank them and you don’t have to use them all at once. You can save them for down the road when maybe you won’t be able to do as well. You can give them away to your friends if you like or use them as plus ones for the things you do. Help people, do public service, go above and beyond, you get credits. Maybe we can crowdsource this too, allow people to “tip” you for a job well done. 


We can create tasks as they become necessary and assign a certain number of credits for doing these jobs. People look for tasks to do, do the ones they enjoy or are good at and gain credits they can use to move up in class and get better shit.


Just think of all the ways you can accumulate wealth now – that’s how you would get credits to use to move up in class. Invent something everyone uses? You get lots of credits. Be a performer that everyone wants to see? Boom, tons of ‘em. But also scientists and sanitation workers will get their actual worth of credits. It won’t be only people who have managed to accumulate (hoard) great wealth.



**moving down in class**

This is where things really get interesting. Criminal acts result in a loss of credits. They are finite so if you don’t keep doing things that get you more credits, you will lose them just by staying in that class. 


If you’re father died a certain caste, you start at his class level. But then you need to maintain it. if you don’t do the same great things your father did, you will sink lower and lower. It’s not just about hoarding money, like it used to be but more about providing valuable services to society, whatever those services might be in the future. Middlemen will get a small number of credits. 


In roman times, when a person won a suit against another citizen he gained all the benefits of the citizen’s status. We can do something similar in our new world. Victims of crimes get the benefits of the perpetrator’s class for a time perhaps, etc. 





To change my view: make me understand why this won’t work. Dredge up some long-term issues. If we do this, what changes in a way that will make things worse rather than better? There might be a way that's *as good* but that fact won't really change my view unless it's significantly an improvement. 

if you want to argue that automation isn't coming or that money will be exactly the same in a post-automated society, shelve that argument for a different post.

They prey upon birds, small mammals, reptiles, and amphibians whether or not they are given meals by human owners. Domestic cats are descendants of European and African Wildcats, which are native to Europe and Africa respectively, and have only been in North America for about 500 years. Local wildlife populations have been decimated wherever these cats are allowed to roam because they are ill equipped to deal with a highly skilled predator that is relatively new to the continent. Here are some facts:

* There are around 60 million feral cats and 73 million domestic cats in America.

* The World Conservation Union has ranked the domestic cat on its infamous list of ""100 of the World's Worst Invasive Alien Species.""

* Domestic cats are the top human-caused threat to wildlife in the United States, killing an estimated 1.3 to 4 billion birds and 6.3 to 22.3 billion mammals annually.

They want to send a message by saying that it is *the country* who is to blame for the recent violence against people of color. In the words of Colin Kaepernick:

&gt; ""I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.""

I don't see this as okay. I commend his and other athlete's cause, so they're far from the ""rebel without a cause"" that is so self-destructive, but to blame *the whole country* as opposed to focusing on specific a-holes who are doing all the damage is unhelpful. In fact, they should still respect the National Anthem, as America still stands for equality and justice for all. Part of it is in the constitution, something which is incredibly difficult to amend:

&gt; Article XV (Amendment 15 - Rights of Citizens to Vote)
The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.

&gt; The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.

Again, I want to support all effort to oppose racial inequality, so CMV.

There is no reason people should be displaced and lacking basic essentials like water for days.  The news predicted the devastation why wasn't supplies, resources, and a tactical unit in place to handle this disaster.  We have seen this type of devastation before.  Every since 9/11, homeland security was birth, plans of preparedness initiated, intense screening and security at national airports.  This same enthusiasm for keeping Americans safe can be used to better prepare and rescue Americans from these natural disasters.  We have developed, trained, engineered, and executed many missions oversees to secure freedom and our invested interest.  We need to invest interest in securing that all Americans can trust they will not be treated like refugees in their homeland.  The greatest country on earth should be constantly learning from our mistakes while we are building and growing to be better prepared in the future.	3	23

The money is okay, but not great, the main problem is the hours. I work every weekend and I don't see my friends, family and partner as much as I'd like.

I’ve tried to change my hours at work but it isn’t going to be an option until at least next year, and even then it won’t be a sure thing, that’s just how long I have until they can examine my rota.

I have been offered work which is just better in every way. More money, (not tons but enough to notice) and pays more money. The hours are better, and the culture is much more similar to what I’d like (I like targets and working hard, that is not the environment in health care).

The only problem is that the job on offer is a working for a short term lender. It’s basically leagalised loan sharking. I’ve got a lot of qualms, and I know a few of my friends and even family would disapprove and loose respect for me if I worked for this company. 

At the end of the day though I want to have weekends off again, and this job sounds great. I want to take the job, and know I’ll regret not taking it (I’ve already turned down a similar role thinking my hours would get better). Convince me otherwise.

Not only are these games desensitizing players and viewers to violence, but they are also giving people the idea that violence is an acceptable way to resolve conflicts. Additionally, because players are often rewarded for simulating violence, these games are giving an unrealistic portrayal of the consequences of violent behavior. Sure, the police chase you in some of the games, but you ""win"" that part of the game if you escape or don't get caught after committing a violent act. Now, the players have learned that being violent will get them what they want as long as the police don't catch them. The police have now become the enemy. Could this be contributing to violence against police officers? I believe so.

To move on to games promoting violence against women, I'll give the example of the ""Grand Theft Auto"" video game series. In the game, players can pay a prostitute, kill her, and get their money back. Are players repulsed by this cruel act of violence? Generally, no. On the contrary, it tends to feel like a small victory. This is just one example of how violence against women in video games reduces empathy for female victims.

We often see videos of physical fights on the news or online that were recorded on a witness' phone. In these videos, there is often at least a small crowd of people watching the fight and recording it on their own phones. Why is nearly everyone's first reaction to take out their phone and hit record? Why isn't anyone stepping in to try to break up the fight? I believe it is because of the desensitization to violence and lack of empathy, which violent video games contribute to now more than ever.

You can be a ""better person"" by demonstrating the most genuine compassion."	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/74l8rq/cmv_compassion_is_the_best_way_to_measure_how/	"Another subjective topic - just allow it to be. There is value in debating subjective ideas. This is an opinion I think people can agree on, but I'd like the idea challenged for a fuller perspective.
I feel out of all the best traits a person can be measured by (such as Intelligence, imagination, wisdom, happiness, health/efficiency, power, etc), I think compassion is the most important.
Religious icons typically gained their their influence through understanding that compassion is the secret to being a good person. These are the most adored humans in history; that's a good measure of ""goodness"" if you are truly loved by so many.
Compassion is the evolutionarily most amazing development in life's history, in my eye. It's what makes humans so special.
Most of all, having compassion leads to success attaining happiness and sharing it with others. That seems like a very convincing measure of ""goodness"" in a human to me.
So can some people philosophically be a better human for being compassionate? Can people be better than others in the first place? I think by this logic, yes... but what do you think? What would you pick to identify what is best in a human life?

While more and more universities are promoting their study abroad programs to a great extent, very few universities require a student to study abroad. 

Students who study abroad will gain a new perspective of the world. Because they will be immersed into a new culture, they will be forced to adapt to that specific culture. They will be able to understand the world around them better, and this can help them learn to respect cultural differences and diversity. In addition, if they travel to a non-English speaking country, they will be able to learn another language, thereby adapting their social and communicative skills. For example, if I were to study abroad in Spain, I would be able to learn Spanish while simultaneously experiencing the Spanish culture, something that can’t be adequately replicated in a traditional classroom setting.

A study conducted by the Georgia Learning Outcomes of Students Studying Abroad Research Initiative discovered that students who study abroad tend to have increased academic performance upon their return. That is, students who study abroad have increased GPAs, as well as higher graduation rates than those who have not studied abroad. This statistic shows that through a study abroad experience, students will be able to achieve higher academic success when they return to their home campus. 

Studying abroad helps a student prepare for the future. According to the University of California Merced, 97% of study abroad students found employment within 12 months of graduation, when only 49% of college graduates found employment in the same period. This statistic proves how studying abroad has beneficial impacts on a student’s future by giving them a better chance of getting a job. 

While I am aware that studying abroad is expensive, there are many ways to overcome the monetary factors. Most study abroad programs cost the same as tuition for that particular school. This being said, a student could take their fall or spring semester courses in a different country. This way, it costs the same as taking the courses at their home campus, and the student is getting a unique educational experience. In addition, there are study abroad scholarships that colleges give to students who would like to study abroad but cannot afford it. 

Studying abroad has countless benefits for students, including greater academic success, a changed perspective of the world, and better options for the future. These traits will prepare students to succeed in the global workforce. For these reasons, I believe that colleges and universities should require students to study abroad.

EDIT: People have made me realize that requiring every student to study abroad is not realistic for students, especially those who have medical conditions, a full-time job, child at home, etc. This being said, my view on this topic has changed. I now believe that colleges and universities should do a better job promoting their study abroad programs, so that the students who are willing and able to study abroad have the opportunity to do so.

Chivalry is outdated because gone are the days where women are looked at as property to be provided and cared for by another person. According to Metro News, 73% of 505 sampled women say that, by their experience, chivalry is dead. But that doesn’t mean the end of all civilities. Proper manners and courtesy are expected, as they are from friends, family, co-workers, and even passersby on the street or company in a crowded store. Sure, chivalry often sparks images of chairs being pulled out and doors being opened, but isn’t that common courtesy?

   Chivalry, as defined by Merriam- Webster Dictionary is “the qualities of an ideal knight through gallant, courteous, and generous behavior.” I do not think women these days are looking for gallant horsemen, therefore, the idea has, by definition, died out. As a young woman in a relationship, I find that gestures of kindness should go both ways. I am not looking to eat every meal for free for the rest of my relationship, in fact, I take pride in treating my boyfriend as he does for me. This way we see each other as equals. He isn’t breaking his bank to tend to my every desire, and I don’t feel like a freeloader. 

   However, this interpretation is not common. Renown feminist, Emma Watson, said she “actually took a man out for dinner and I chose the restaurant and I offered to pay. It was really awkward and uncomfortable.” Is that just because men still stick to the old-fashioned definition of chivalry? Or is that just because men feel emasculated if they are the ones being taken care of? This is what equality is all about and it should go both ways. Men should not feel uncomfortable should a woman want to pick up the bill every once and awhile, instead they should value her independence. Chivalry is dead, instead, equality is alive.

I wanted to continue this discussion, as I personally hold a pretty solid opinion against it but we were getting toward some reasonable exceptions and good discussion.

So you can see where I've been so far:

Apparently those posts are invisible to everyone but me. Screencaps here: https://imgur.com/a/2WULJ

My personal red line is integrated infantry units, for a lot of reasons, and I'm pretty iffy on if we should have integrated women into the support roles of infantry units. I lived through that, and even met my wife in a medical platoon of an infantry unit. Good points would be legitimate benefits to integration other than the empowerment of the women joining (what good is that if we lose a war to a country that doesn't let women drive?), and proper examples where integration has been studied to have little ill effect in countries like Israel. As far as I know, integration in other countries has been pretty limited or even ""token"".

edit: I didn't want to relitigate my entire view since it's provided in the screencaps, but the tl;dr is women are more prone to musculoskeletal injury which is a problem in a profession that requires carrying 60-120lbs of extra weight, sexual relationships are a big problem in a combat environment, and the difference of medical needs and pregnancies are problematic as well. The problems seem to outweigh the expected upsides.

edit 3: It seems discussion has died off, I want to thank those who participated in good faith, I did realign a bit on a couple of key points and I learned a few things although my core belief is unchanged. If anyone has anything to say I'm still monitoring this thread."	1	43

If you look at federal student loans they automatically get in the business of picking winners and losers, and by giving loans to students at for-profit colleges they make shareholders wealthy at the expense of taxpayers.

In addition, the private market has lower rates and the ability to refinance loans, so in this case the market is more efficient than the government.

If the concern is to get people into college the government should do this via tax credits and rebates, not student loans as failure to repay student loans hurts the taxpayer. Federal student loan forgiveness also discriminates against people who take out fewer loans (or no loans) and subsidizes the education of some people but not others.  Why should one teacher get loan forgiveness but another one who didn't take out loans not get that benefit?  The government is giving some people more money than others simply based on if they took out a loan or not, not based on their actual profession.

A bit of background: I am a gay male attending a religious university; though I am not involved with the LGBT organization on campus (for reasons I will explain below), both of my housemates hold leadership roles in the organization.

When I first arrived at this university I was excited to join the (at the time unofficial) LGBT club in order to meet other gay people. I found the community welcoming and very accommodating. At the time, this club was lobbying the administration to become official and they eventually succeeded. Once the club became an official organization the membership swelled and ever since it seems that the organization's members have become resentful toward the university and straight people in general because of perceived (though unintentional and possibly blown out of proportion) slights and offenses. Going to club meetings became very frustrating because they have just become an echo chamber for the members to talk about how much they hate anyone that isn't LGBT. My own roommate often talks about how she wishes straight people would die. I have no clue what happened to create this culture, but it has alienated and isolated the LGBT community to the point that I think the relationship between members of the community and others at the university has taken a sharp turn for the worse; I wouldn't hesitate to say that the general feeling toward LGBT students is now contempt at best. I can say however that none of this happened until the club was officially recognized. I've discussed this with my roommates and they acknowledge the phenomenon but don't consider it to be a bad thing at all.

Again, this is very anecdotal so I would accept as having changed my view any argument that persuades me 1) that this is particular to my school or religious schools in general, 2) that this sort of hatred from LGBT people has always existed, or 3) that what I'm seeing within the LGBT community isn't a problem."	26	13	
changemyview	t3_7ezmye	https://www.reddit.com//r/changemyview/comments/7ezmye/cmv_although_abortion_is_morally_permissible_up/	2017-11-23 13:29:06	Sonata_Arcticuno	CMV: Although abortion is morally permissible up to birth at the moment (practical concerns aside), when we get wombtank technology, fetuses should be stuck in a wombtank if they've matured beyond 23 weeks.	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/7ezmye/cmv_although_abortion_is_morally_permissible_up/	"The reason that I support abortion is that I believe that the right to bodily autonomy trumps the fetus' right to life, and that in a pregnancy, the woman acts as a host for something that acts like a parasite, and should a woman wish to terminate the relationship, she should be allowed to. This right is akin to self-defense, and even if it results in the death of the baby (as is inevitable with abortion), it is similar to using any means necessary to stop someone from attacking you, or to not having to donate a kidney to save someone's life, even if it results in their death. 

Before 23 weeks gestation, abortion should be allowed in all cases. Only by 23 weeks gestation does the thalamus connect to the cortex, which is required for the fetus to feel actual pain*. Before that, the fetus' feels no pain, just reflex reactions, sort of like someone's leg twitching when a doctor hits the knee with a hammer. There is no unpleasantness, just a reaction. Since there is no suffering to speak of, aborting before 23 weeks is about as morally reprehensible as having a wank.

After 23 weeks, even though the fetus still feels pain, the woman's right to bodily autonomy still stands above the fetus' right to life, and so abortions can be performed. However, if we ever get wombtank tech, we will have a way to preserve both the woman's body autonomy and the fetus', by sticking it in the wombtank. It seems to me that the moral thing to do would be to get the fetus out of the woman (therefore preserving her body autonomy), but since the need for the fetus to die is gone, and since the fetus can already feel pain by this stage, the moral thing to do would be to let it develop naturally in the wombtank. The woman should always be given an option to break off all contact with the fetus (such as in a closed adoption), or to be able to take the baby home when it's finished developing. 

Before 23 weeks though, abortion is still fair game. No pain means no obligation to avoid pain, and therefore abortion is morally permissible.

EDIT: By abortion being morally permissible up to birth, I mean that if the woman can magically make a fetus disappear painlessly, she should be given the right to for as long as the fetus still relies physically on her. Since we don't have magic, we don't do this irl.

The Senate is supposed to protect the rights of states, while the House should be more ""1 person 1 vote"". 

2. A larger amount of delegates would increase representation, be more fair, make it more difficult for lobbyists to influence government, and increase political diversity in Congress. 

3. It is not justifiable that a voter in Wyoming have a more powerful vote, in the House, and that same voter living in California. Wyoming has 1:586,107 ratio of delegates to people. California has 1:740,566. 

4. An ideal solution, in my view, would be to increase the size of the House to have 1 delegate per 100,000 citizens. This would lead to a House of approximately 3,263. A compromise solution would be to make the number of delegates proportional to the smallest district, eg: 1 delegate per 580,000 people. This would make the House have approximately 557 delegates. 

**Practicalities**

 **Where do they fit?** 

If you can't fit at least 557 in the current House, it doesn't matter. It's the 21st century. Delegates are perfectly capable of telecommunication and voting remotely. If our communications system is secure enough for military use, it can be adapted to be secure enough for government use. If anything, having delegates spread across the country would be beneficial by diluting the concentration of power, making lobbying more difficult by firms in DC and making delegates more able to meet with their constituents. You can then have a general meeting, if you wish, where all are physically present, once or twice a year. There are many countries with huge parliaments that meet with little logistical trouble. 

**How do you pay for them?**

It's a drop in the bucket, well worth the benefits. Buy one or two fewer fighter jets. 

**New York City and Los Angeles would have dozens of delegates. Their districts would be the size of a few square blocks!**

So what? The Senate is supposed to protect the interests of smaller states. They don't need two chambers. The House is supposed to represent the people, and people live in cities and deserve to have their voice heard too. "	9	11

It was very hard to actually find out what the proposed changes are. From what I was reading, and the meme's, it seemed quite bad.

The future holds a $5 surplus to use YouTube, $7 for YouTube 4k content etc. That competitor offerings would be blocked.

But the thing is, there are specific articles in section 8 of the FCR regulation, that specifically ban:

blocking, 

throttling, 

paid-prioritization.

That are not being touched. 
Also current, long standing regulations already give ISP's a loophole: ""Reasonable network management shall not be considered a violation of this rule.""

The other actual change on the side of mobiles, seem to be the addition of the word ""all""

so this:
&gt; That is interconnected with the public switched network, or interconnected with the public switched network through an interconnected service provider, that gives subscribers the capability to communicate to or receive communication from other users on the public switched network

becomes:
&gt;That is interconnected with the public switched network, or interconnected with the public switched network through an interconnected service provider, that gives subscribers the capability to communicate to or receive communication from all other users on the public switched network 

So private networks, or networks that limit interconnection, are no longer under the jurisdiction of the FCC's rules for carrier behaviour

I'm really not seeing the Destruction of the internet as we see it...change my view

For every comment downvoted for not being ""relevant to discussion"" there are a million more just for opposing the hive-mind. In my opinion it would be far better to just have moderators remove irrelevant comments rather than giving the power to adamant oposition and bots.

Of course people could move to different subs, but this just makes every one side of an argument aggregate to one subreddit and there is never any real debate at all. By removing downvotes unwanted discussion also becomes far easier to delete and ban as it is actually visible by the moderators. 

It's even in the rettiquette to not downvote something just because you disagree with it, but this happens *all the time* and the admins have *never once* punished someone for doing so, even when it can be obvious like when someone says they voted Republican on /r/politics. 

Basic reasons for them to be removed:

* Results in censoring of differing opinions.

* Gives bots the power to censor opinions.

* Makes unpopular opinions hard to find unless sorting by controversial, something most redditors do not do.

* Would make actual criticisms of things harder to ignore and would force people to look at touchy issues, something which is good.

The core problem is that tickets are often priced far too low which gives an inaccurate view of demand. The scalper bots allow artists to understand what the true earning potential is of their performances and allows them to either schedule far more events to satisfy that demand (which will lower average individual prices) or charge far higher prices on tickets to begin with.

Artists win either way since this improved pricing information will allow them to earn more. The more income potential artists have the more incentive they have to produce even more content and the greater the incentive for more artists to tap into that market demand.

In the end, fans will win by the greater market demand pricing transparency that scalping bots generate. It is just taking a while for the effects of automated scalping to work it's way through the system. Eventually artists will adjust their event pricing and quantity of events sufficiently to balance the demand of the market and render scalping less cost effective.

We're constantly encouraged to empathize with others and rarely encouraged to strictly sympathize.  While I think empathy is important, I think it's unhealthy to empathize constantly.

With empathy comes feelings.  With our unprecedented access to information on the lives of others, there's simply too much bad out there to constantly empathize and maintain happiness.  An inability to compartmentalize the desire to help others and *feeling* others' pain will undoubtedly have a negative impact on the individual doing the empathizing.  The difference between sympathy and empathy is mainly that with sympathy (without the connotation of looking down on the less fortunate) you don't experience the feelings associated with whatever it is you're witnessing or reading about.  Especially with strangers, this emotional separation is a healthier alternative than empathy.

I want to note that I draw a distinction between the 'understanding' part and the 'sharing' part of empathy.  Understanding is good, but my specific issue is with the 'sharing' of feelings and experiences associated with empathy.

An important part of sympathy and empathy is how it spurs us into helping others who are going through tough times of some sort.  For those who need empathetic feelings in order to help someone else, that's fine, but in my opinion sympathy alone should be enough to help because it's helping simply because it is the right thing to do, not because we share an emotional connection where helping them is also helping ourselves.

During his rule, there was freedom of speech, expression and opinion. Politicians would daily criticize him and insult him on TV and they feared no repercussions. Nowadays, Egyptians are very wary to even tweet something that may be deemed inappropriate or insulting to the government since they may face imprisonment. 

The Economy of Egypt was much much better under Morsi’s rule. The Egyptian pound was stronger, Morsi’s goal was to achieve self-sufficiency in food, medicine and weaponry. Regarding food, Egypt was almost self-sufficient in wheat. Egypt also launched its first tablet. Now, after the devaluement of the Egyptian pound and the increase in prices of all kinds of products, Egypt is in a worse situation overall.

Egypt was politically stronger during Morsi's rule. It was a key player in Middle Eastern politics. Right now its merely a puppet of Saudi Arabia and UAE.

Im open to all ideas and I would like to get an insight on different points of views regarding this topic.

The first reason I oppose AA is that it insults and devalues the achievements of the races it targets. I believe that the idea employers and educational institutions should expect less from POC is racist. Think about it this way, if you were in a high-jumping competition and the bar was lowered for you but not everybody else you would feel insulted that less was expected from you. As well as insulting POC, AA also devalues their achievements. The fact it exists means that, no matter how hard they work, there will always be some people that will attribute their success to AA. Picture this, a young black man dedicates his teenage years to his education and his hard work pays off when he moves on to university and then a high salary job, only for his peers to label him the ""token black guy."" Would that not be infuriating?

The second reaso  is that it is discriminatory against white people. Don't get me wrong, I'm not some kind of alt-right moron who thinks white people are oppressed because of the Civil Rights Act, I understand that minorities such as Black people are economically, and as a result educationally, disadvantaged due to historic, and to a lesser extent present day, racism. However, I do not think that makes it right to discriminate against white people based on their race. The real solution to racial inequality in education/employment is to invest more in poorer and inner city schools and treat all applicants equally irrespective of race. 

TL;DR Expecting less from POC is racist. Discrimination against white people, while far less common than dicrimination against POC, is also racist."	227	287

I think that from both a science and philosophical standpoint- this is absurd.

Firstly, there are 3 pathways that many simulation theorists use, 1) the human race becomes extinct before we reach this this technology 2) we eventually posses the technology for simulation but do not carry it out for ethical and moral reasons and 3) we are currently living in a simulation. Even from a probability standpoint, there is a 2/3 chance we are not living in a simulation, that is enough for me to dismiss completely. Not to mention the incentive of a future civilisation to run these simulations can not be very high as it does not benefit them at all.

Next from a philosophical standpoint, another reason I strongly believe against simulation is because of René Descartes idea that “I think, therefore, I am” I have taken this to mean that we have self-awareness, what simulation would allow its “characters” to know they are within this simulation? Additionally, the idea that I can think my own thoughts and believe the things I believe is as good a reason as any for me existing.

EDIT: Although my view hasn’t all been changed, it has opened my eye and shown how I posted this CMW with not a lot of knowledge of this interesting topic. Also that my own fear of the simulation theory could be what leads me to not believe in it. But it is purely a decision needed to be made by the individual not based on fact or physical evidence.

a bit of a technical topic, but it keeps bothering me. 

I am a photographer and videographer so I am not totaly ignorant of the topic. I am pretty sure that I am right, but all manufacturers and even selling ""expert"" keep telling me the oposit of my view.

If any TV, Projector or Software interpolates a pixel based image (say a 1920x1080 hd image from a blue ray) to an image with a higher pixel count (say 4k), than it does this by interpolating (adding the nearby original pixels and take some kind of clever average) new pixels between the original pixel. 

This reduces the visibility of the pixels, (there wont be any visible pixel-grid if you interpolate correct), if you move closer to the screen. (the worst way of interpolation would be simply repeating the pixels). 

BUT: this can NOT render any new details or any new sharpness. The interpolation can NOT make an edge more correct and it can not create more details in an image. The only way an image can be scaled and becoming actualy sharper, is if the image is vector based, like an Adobe Illustrator File. But this is obviously not the case in Pixel-based-Images like from a movie. 

My view is especially understandable if we look at an extreme exmple. Imagine you take an sd image and interpolate it to 8k. Its obvious that this cant result in any better image quality than just an SD image. 

Any sales guy tells me I am wrong. Am I crazy? CMV.

Basically I believe that a combination of Trumps ego, the incredible hatred republicans have for democrats and the selfishness of republican politicians mean that they would end democracy in America and replace it with a more authoritarian system of government where law enforcement attacks their enemies, opposition leaders are arrested and their supporters disenfranchised, civil rights are trampled and the media is silenced.

My reasoning is this:

**Trump is instinctively an authoritarian ruler.** Trump wants to be president for no particular reason and needs to be praised constantly. He also hates critics and limits to his power. He has long hated the media and judiciary and now is turning on the FBI. He dominates his party. He praises foreign dictators and dislikes democratic norms. So far he has been restrained by Americas political system and his own incompetence but he would happily take much more power for the sake of his ego and to punish the people he hates.

**Republican voters seem to hate democrats more than they care for their country.** Despite occasional complaints from ""Never Trumpers"", its clear that most republicans would happily justify any behaviour from Trump or, at best, distract attention by blaming democrats, in order to impose their social views and 'beat' democrats. They would happily support trump regardless of whether he is guilty of treason or sexual assault and if trump is to be stopped, it will not be by republican voters who have already decided that party comes before country.

This means the only obstacle to Trump destroying America's rule of law and checks and balances is political rulers themselves. Unfortunately democrats are out of power and **republican politicians don't care about trumps excesses or democracy and only want power**. From decrying trump as racist, Paul Ryan now supports him. From calling him a ""kook"", Lindsey Graham now largely supports Trump. Mitch McConnell never really had any concerns with trump to begin with. It seems that as long as trump delivers for their donors, republican leaders would happily destroy the system to protect him as tax cuts and deregulation come first. If you look at issues like debt and the environment, republicans happily ignore or bury evidence that their tax cuts and deregulation will endanger people and press ahead. There's no reason to believe trump will be any different. The few who recognise the danger (e.g. Flake, McCain, Romney) lack the power and/or will to stop him.

So I'll award a delta to anyone who can convince me that I'm wrong about one  (though hopefully more) of these 3 things or can point out something that I'm missing that disproves my conclusions. Thanks for reading!

changemyview	t3_7xst9t	https://www.reddit.com//r/changemyview/comments/7xst9t/cmv_current_media_reporting_tactics_are/	2018-02-15 19:25:41	IslayThePeaty	CMV: Current media reporting tactics are contributing to the prevalence of school shootings in America, and guidelines should be put in place to minimize this.	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/7xst9t/cmv_current_media_reporting_tactics_are/	"Firstly, what I'm referring to as school shootings are attacks specifically intended to kill 3 or more people (not including the shooter) at a school, especially if the school is intentionally chosen as the site for the attack. This may be someone trying to kill indiscriminately, or it may be against specific people. 

What I (and I believe most reasonable people) do not consider to be a ""school shooting"" are events such as: 

* suicides on school grounds 
* accidental discharges of weapons that happen to be on school grounds (especially when no one is injured and/or the weapon is legally there–for instance, a police officer's mishandled weapon discharging and injuring no one was reported as a ""school shooting"")
* the commission of an unrelated crime with a firearm (e.g., someone robbed a bank, ran from the cops, and was taken down by firefight in a school parking lot)
* the intentional or accidental discharge of a weapon where a bullet happens to pass through property owned by a school
* a spouse, significant other, jealous ex, stalker, etc., of a school employee attacking that person at work (the school here is not chosen specifically because it is a school, but because the victim happens to work there)

You may agree or disagree with my definition, but it is linked to my reasoning below.

You may or may not be aware of Media-Related Suicide Contagion (see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK207262/#_sec_0076_). This is the phenomenon that occurs when suicides are reported at a national level in the newsmedia, and for the days (rarely weeks) afterwards, there is a statistically significant upswing in the number of suicides in the general population. In other words, national media coverage of suicides tends to inspire other people to commit suicide. These effects are exacerbated when the reported suicides are sensationalized or romanticized in the media, and they are slightly muted (though there is still a statistically significant increase) when the abnormality of the suicide victim is emphasized in the reporting.

Now, my view is that this same contagion applies to school shootings (likely to mass shootings as well, but let's keep to one topic for now). National media coverage, especially sensationalized coverage that focuses on things like gun control rather than demonizing the perpetrator, causes a similar spike in mass shootings. Considering the fact that these school shootings can stay in the national media coverage for weeks after the event, the effects documented in Media-Related Suicide Contagion would be even more meaningful for what I'll refer to as Media-Related School Shooting Contagion.

I don't particularly want this to be a gun control vs. mental health debate, though I realize these topics may come up in response, but change my view that media reporting is contributing (and likely in a very statistically significant way) to the frequency of school shootings in America.

And while he may have very well died, his imprint is present to this day in each and every one of us, but fading quickly. What will take its place? Many cling to spirituality, the modified and mass produced eastern import meant to bring temporary comfort to those who are beginning to understand their deep psychological need for a moral framework that their biology alone cannot give. Unfortunately the god of Reason, humanities new savior will not cast a blind eye to this deep plead for moral grounding, and spirituality too, will fade away. 

What can take its place? I am grouping spirituality and any assumptions on human consciousness with religion for this as it conventionally refers to a type of faith not rooted in the observable universe. Some of the premises of my claim include that objective morality does not exist, and that therefore a free, healthy (relatively atleast) society geared towards lasting health and progress needs a moral foundation. I also assert that we are slowly but surely losing this foundation as we and the world becomes more atheist and based in science and reason, neither of which have ways to satisfy this need. People assert that we are naturally social and empathic creatures, but empathy and our tendency for teamwork has limits that could never be enough to be the groundwork of complex society, I believe most of us take for granted how much religious systems have impacted each of our moral frameworks, and that we have too much faith in human empathy, which generally speaking is useful only for family in a natural human environment, it is simply unreliable, unclear, and very limited in scope. moral codes of conduct create clarity for large scale human cooperation. small villages may be possible without a moral foundation, but not much more. 

EDIT : So far I found one comment in particular that really seemed to understand the argument im making, most of the other comments seem to feel im making an arguement on how good or bad religion is, whether we ""need"" religion, my views on morality, and a bunch of other things I dont really have any stake in. Here's the response from HerbertWigglesworth that attempts to address my arguement: 

""It would be interesting to see what the world would be like if institutionalised religion had never existed. People will have still asked the same questions, why are we here, what is the origin of the perceivable existence, do we have purpose etc. No doubt, the desire to discuss and attempt to answer these questions will have still resulted in people clustering together to discuss and share ideas, they will also - as an attempt to optimise their survival and reduce their suffering - clustered together to create societies that try to improve their own and their loves ones lives.

In order to improve the success of a grouping of people, who all have differing experiences, beliefs and aspirations, the unpredictability of the surrounding environment and those that inhabit it has to be manipulated, optimised for the require purpose / goal (survival and improvement of life), made predictable by practices that allow sustenance in respect of a given necessity (access to water, food, resources, sedation / control of threats, behaviour of individuals when alone and with others, and methods of managing / mitigating and resolving the impacts of any transgressions of the established / sought order). The requirements of a given individual / commune change to reflect the surrounding environment, and therefore so do the priorities and behaviours of the population, this in itself will alter the way people interact with one and other, a movement from self centred interest and preservation, towards the preservation of the other, as the other becomes an extension of the self, and an in-/direct form of sustenance as opposed to threat, enemy of competition. An example of this is that culling others for sustenance or to alleviate a perceived threat stops, people combine their efforts, share beliefs, desires, and practice to develop and improve their chances of survival, and also establish new forms of entertainment and interest via exposing each other to stories, anecdotes, and ideas.

Through collective action, people establish roles, the areas where they succeed or offer the most beneficial contributions will be their responsibility, leaders, gatherers, processors, nurturers etc, a hierarchy begins to form, a production line. Infrastructure develops around the aforementioned, in line with the requirements of the era, what is successful is repeated, what is unsuccessful is avoided, and new processes are established to tackle the unsolved, or to improve existing methods. This applies to the acquisition, management and distribution of resources, but also to the maintenance of solidarity and morale between a diverse populace. Societal expectations are created, in conjunction with the beliefs of the day - the Zeitgeist - where individuals participation in public society (and to a certain degree their private life) is expected be considerate to the aforementioned, and support that which has been agreed. On the other hand, there will be pioneers, renegades, individuals that believe a significant alteration to the existing is required to truly progress, depending on their efforts to introduce and implement such change, the individual and proposal will face varied responses from the already established, those with most authority and their adherents.

What society evidences is an ever changing approach to ensuring survival, we refine our processes to optimise that which we require, minimising the perceived negative impact while accommodating even the most undesirable aspects of humanity, the most complex of questions / dilemmas we face, broadening the bounds of benefit, and isolating incidents of harm.

This all occurs through education and experience. Being faced with something, making an attempt at handling it, understanding the response, and trying again. Religion is an element of this, it is an institution within the greater society that attempts to offer a way of living. It is however, but one of many institutions, while it occurs in many forms and deviations, it is but one element / result of collective human society. Efforts to improve our lives will continue to be made within and outside of such institutions.

As a result, I think restricting our formulation and consideration of morality to religious institutions and their frameworks, is counterproductive, and less accessible than more neutral consideration, that transcends the bounds of a rigid institution. Understanding how ourselves and our actions can be improved to best reflect a more idealistic human capacity is and will continue to be a part of every individual, no matter their affiliation with a given sect, nor their affiliation with a religious community.""

These kids don't have any money, and they say, oh look, a free thing that's entertaining and I can waste time on! Fortnite is also a ripoff of other games (cough cough PUBG). If Fortnite cost money, kids wouldn't be able to buy it or as attracted to it, so there goes a lot of the userbase. I have a few reasons I don't buy a game: 

1. too expensive

2. ripoff of other games

3. doesn't seem very fun

Games don't have to go through this if they're free, who doesn't want free stuff? I want free stuff. However, if Fortnite cost money, it wouldn't pass the test and I wouldn't buy it. CMV!

Long time liberal. Volunteered/Donated to political campaigns. 

Let's begin with the assumption that we all agree killing an infant after it's born is horrific and we want to avoid that at pretty much any cost. Let's also stipulate that this ban is not being used as a trojan horse to fuck with access to clinics etc.

Basically, I'd argue that given the enormity of ending an infant's life and the remarkable similarity a 20+ week fetus bears to an infant, we should ban non-therapeutic abortions after 20 weeks, bringing the US in line with the rest of the world. 

As I understand it (definitely not a doctor and would love to hear from one) a 20 week old fetus can ""see""/sense light, move and ""kick"" in the womb, *make facial expressions*, suck its thumb, produce urine, has heartbeat and observable gender, and most organs are developed. This list could be much longer. As far as I can tell the medical consensus on when life begins is that there isn't a consensus. 

For context, the US is one of just six or seven countries that allows non-therapeutic (no medical necessity) abortion after 20 weeks. We don't know when life begins, but we do have statistics on fetal viability: about 20-35% at 23 weeks. 

This is not to say that life begins at this point, but simply that it might, and given the roughly 8000 abortions in the US after 20 weeks the risk that something tragic is happening on a large scale is unacceptably high. 

Of course this becomes trickier in the case of catastrophic birth defects, and the term ""non-therapeutic"" is slippery when it comes to birth defects. Regardless, I'd guess a significant portion of the aforementioned post 20 week abortions don't involve defects, which are rare, and many of those that do are detected long before 20 weeks. I'd argue that these less complicated cases should definitely be banned.

Disclaimer: This is not intended to pass judgment on anyone's choices; the idea that there's an *obvious* answer to the abortion question is IMO the only truly stupid response, so if you come at this from the point of view that people who've had 20+ week abortions are going to hell you're probably underestimating the complexity of life and should think carefully before posting. The point is that this is an incredibly complicated, unclear, and charged issue, so let's talk/CMV. 

P.S.:  feel free to point out studies that differ/dispute my facts, but try and engage with the thrust of the argument and not litigate whether there are 8000 or 6800 21+ week abortions if the difference between the two won't change the answer to anything.

They should be for all families.	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/884ozz/cmvchildcare_subsidies_should_not_only_be_for/	"Childcare is expensive.  It's a fact known across the country.  One of the reasons states support childcare subsidies is because it allows the parent to work or attend school.  They see the overall economic benefit to the state and the personal benefit to the family.  

Those facts don't change based on income.  It costs a high-income family (not rich, but $75-$150k) the same (or more) to send their children to daycare.  That is money out of their pocket that could be going into the local economy as well.  The daycare center would still be paid, except by the state like for subsidized children, so no one would lose money or customers. The average cost of childcare in the US is $196/week.  That's nearly $10,000 per year.  If a family has two children that will cost them $20,000 per year.  Why should the government not want that $20,000 in the local economy? 

Because daycare is so expensive and only some families are subsidized it creates two worlds - one for poorer families and a more competitive (and expensive) system for higher-income families.  The government is discriminating against children based on their parent's income.

I believe that with modern technology we can voice our concern to the state more efficiently than what a person can do. 

A person may have internal biases and ulterior motive that may run against the interest of the people who voted for him. 

While technology; barring hacking and manipulation, would represent the true intent of the people.

An example is the algorithm of reddit, which represent decently the interest of the people by the simple voting system.

This goes without saying that I endorse absolute democracy in more serious matters, I believe that to be qualified to vote, a person must first be educated and well informed in the topic at hand before being allowed to vote.

Recent statistics suggest that an average of only ten people a year are killed by sharks. My view is that the statistic is so surprising as it's untrue. I can't help wonder how many people were classed as just ""missing"" and not shown as shark victims, and how reliable these apparent statistics are. Furthermore, I believe this could be beneficial to the conservational efforts we have in place to protect sharks; to de-demonize them and though I support efforts to prevent animals going extinct, I feel that misinformation is not the way to go about this.

Documentaries on sharks will usually paint the picture that sharks mistake is for a seal or other typical marine prey. I believe that sharks can see is for exactly what we are: land-dwelling mammals flailing in an environment completely out of our depths. And if sharks "" don't like the taste of human flesh"", how does one explain the Massacre by sharks when the USS Indianapolis sunk? I respect and rightfully fear the large predators who call the ocean their home, but I doubt they are as friendly as some would have us believe. "	1	22

With all of the children in the foster care system and orphanages around the world, why would we want to be having more than two children rather than taking care of the ones we already have?

I poorly worded my opinion, and for anyone who answers after this edit, I would like to rephrase me “view” to be: Practicing a religion is pointless, and not practicing a religion is a poor and inefficient use of your time.

To preface, I am a white male, raised in a mostly non-religious household. My mother is technically catholic, as well as my father, but both could be considered atheist given their current views. 

I would like to believe in a religion, or a god, and I’ve tried many times. I’ve been to a multitude of churches, read the Bible extensively and portions of the Quran, and am relatively well versed in the main three monotheistic religions.

I believe that there is a “meaning” to the creation of the universe, but I don’t agree with the majority of the foundation of Christianity, Islam, or Judaism. I believe the Bible was mostly folklore with a lot of symbolic messages to be interpreted in a manner for each individual to apply to their own life.

My reasoning for believing what I do is as follows:
• If nobody told religious followers to believe in a god, nobody would stumble across religion themselves and begin following one religion. It exists, because someone with authority said we should believe these things.

•Religion is largely backed with fear. Fear of not getting accepted into an afterlife, fear of being shunned, fear of being banished to hell. How could a dynamic concept like religion be accurate if it is founded on fear?
•There is no concrete evidence of a god.
•I believe religion has a lot of followers because it is naturally instinctive for humans to look for an underlying meaning as to “why” we are here, and what our purpose is. Religion fills this void.
•If god loves everyone, why does he allow bad things to happen to people?
•With the massive size of the universe, and in perspective, how small we are, why is it logical to assume that god specifically created “us”?
•I’ve lead a positive life, consider myself generous and helpful, and an overall successful, why do I need religion?
• Any time someone shows any opposition for religion in a religious environment (such as asking questions or contesting the message at church), they are met with resistance. People who are part of religion are generally un-open to having their views discussed in a manner where they could be interpreted differently. The general attitude at most religious gatherings that i have experienced, is that questioning the Bible or word of god, is taboo. I don’t believe that an environment that doesn’t support questioning foundations of reasoning is a plausible belief.

That being said, I support religion and acknowledge how it benefits society. Many people close to me have benefited greatly from Church, and I am thankful for that. I mean no disrespect in any of my comments, and look forward to hopefully having my opinion changed.

[Definition of moral relativism for the sake of clarity](https://www.iep.utm.edu/moral-re/):

&gt;Moral relativism is the view that moral judgments are true or false only relative to some particular standpoint (for instance, that of a culture or a historical period) and that no standpoint is uniquely privileged over all others.  It has often been associated with other claims about morality: notably, the thesis that different cultures often exhibit radically different moral values; the denial that there are universal moral values shared by every human society; and the insistence that we should refrain from passing moral judgments on beliefs and practices characteristic of cultures other than our own.""

That said, if a society abides by moral relativism, it allows the individuals in power to corrupt that doctrine in such a way as to repress undesirable thoughts and actions that run afoul of the desires of the ruling class, generally for the purposes of further concentrating and centralizing power for their benefit. For example, pick any one of the modern controversial topics (abortion, gay marriage, gun rights, etc) and you will have large and powerful groups claiming the moral high ground while demeaning those that disagree for the purposes of garnering and solidifying further support. This has been the case for hundreds (really thousands) of years with the ruling classes utilizing various ""wedge issues"" to garner support (women's suffrage, interracial marriage, the draft, take your pick).

I would further argue that the only solution to this dilemma is to establish the notion of an objective ""good"" and an objective ""evil"" which exist above and beyond all societal constructs and is universal for all humans. As humans, we have the capacity and ability to understand complex issues due to our ability to reason and as such, we can objectively operate from the ethical standpoint of ""your rights end where my rights begin"". This adequately explains why I don't have the right to randomly punch people in the face. My right to swing my fist ends as soon as someone's face is in the way and to do so would be considered an ""immoral"" (bad) action since I am causing them direct harm. 

This is really straight out of the objectivist's playbook and operates under the assumption that the fundamental desire of man is the freedom to pursue their life as they see fit without undue intervention from any external entity (government, religion, culture, etc). As individuals, we have only to answer to ourselves and our desires so long as the actions we partake of in our pursuits do not infringe upon the individual rights of others. This is often referred to as the ""non-aggression principle (NAP)"" in Libertarian ethics.

In short, the rights of the individual are paramount, the notion of liberty is the only objective ""good"" in the world, anything that seeks to infringe on those individual rights barring proper utilization of the NAP is objectively ""bad"", and thus moral relativism falls by the wayside and can no longer be utilized by a corrupt ruling power to subjugate the masses.

I also have a lot of work to be done, so I thank everyone here who took time out of their days to help change my view on this.

My view is that PragerU is an online video program meant to make people conservative and they are intellectually dishonest and therefore is not worth watching.  Even those who agree with the points being presented (which I usually do not) should oppose the low quality arguments being presented in these videos.  The evidence I have supporting this is two fold.  
1.  Pratically all of their videos promote exclusively conservative values.
2.  Their videos never address serious counter arguments and engage in frequent fallacious argument making.

For example, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XJZC411WsM&amp;feature=youtu.be) is about why girls shouldn't be allowed into the Boy Scouts (which is now known as the Scouts).  The speaker, Will Witt, spends his time railing against the leftists that forced the Scouts to change their ways because of their political ideology.  He also argues that having girls in the Scouts will distract the boys from being boys.  Lastly, he says that girls who wish to do the things that boy scouts do should just found their own organization.

However, all of these are false.  Firstly, they are letting in girls because they are a private organization who is losing members and wishes to make more money.  Secondly, the troops themselves will be gender segregated.  Finally, while this isn't false, these girls could found their own origination, why should they when there is an orginzation that already supports them (the Scouts).

To avoid cherry-picking or strawmaning (two things that PragerU is fond of), [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIBtb_NuIJ1xzDfMyGhkbo3hikZ9FST0z) is a list of videos, produced by Dennis Prager himself, about the differences between the right and a straw man he created for the left.  Even the view videos on topics I have agreed with have little to no real counter-arguments in them.  [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHrihwWJv8o&amp;index=54&amp;t=0s&amp;list=PLIBtb_NuIJ1zs1gI2nYdZk6wL606nGOQ9) cherry picks European countries to make it look like Europe as a whole opposes abortion when that is not true.

TL;DR, PragerU exists not for educating, but making people conservative and they lie, mislead, and cherry pick to do this.

What will CMV:
1. Showing PragerU's fallacies are mistakes and that they opposing fallacious reasoning by conservatives.
2. An argument that gives a reason to watch PragerU (excluding ironically, to learn about your opponents thinking, and [edited in] entertainment).
3. Evidence that PragerU does not use straw men on a consistent basis (the most difficult in my mind).

What will not CMV:
1. Any sort of equivocation (i.e. those on the left do it).

Basically, I contend that, based on what we can assume, if the Nationalist Government of the Republic of China had put down the Communist Revolution, history would have gone better. Now ""better"" is a relative term, but I'll explain why I believe so.

First, the obvious. Mao Zedong's government killed around 45 million people. Some people put that number as high as 78 million, but either way, he's up there with Hitler and Stalin as one of the most brutal dictators and mass murderers in history. Chiang Kai\-Shek, on the other hand, was not exactly a benevolent ruler either; but the most excessive count I can find puts him as responsible for 18 million deaths. Still far too high, but far cry from Zedong. Let's also not forget that only about 2.8 million of those deaths were from corruption or political repression. The rest were the result of war. So; even if Chiang had continued corrupt and repressive policies in peacetime, that's still millions of lives saved right off the bat.

Secondly, there's the likelihood that the Republic of China would have reformed into a democracy. That's what it did on Taiwan after all, on top of becoming one of the ""Four Asian Tigers"". Let's not forget that, ideologically speaking, the Republic was only supposed to follow authoritarian policies until the country was stable and educated enough for democracy. Of course, there's no way of knowing whether or not the Kuomintang officials would have honored their pledge, and this also doesn't mean that the transition would have been smooth. But, it still seems likely that it would have happened eventually. Communist China is still a dictatorship today. I doubt the shallow, corrupt system that the Kuomintang perpetuated would have been so stable to the democratic wave of the late 80s and early 90s.

Third, there's the benefit for the rest of the world. With China an anti\-Communist ally, the Korean War would have gone much differently. North Korea would have been surrounded by American allies, and thus less likely to attack South Korea. But even if it had decided to do so, the only chance of victory it would have is if the West just didn't care enough to stop them. I'm aware that the only way America was able to get a coalition together from the UN was thanks to the Soviet Union boycotting over Taiwan, but let's be honest, it's not like America and South Korea couldn't have defeated North Korea on their own, especially if China was on their side. So, either no Korean War or a decisive Western victory. In a Western victory, Korea is united, all those killed by Kim Il\-Sung survive, and the united Korean Republic likely would be democratic as it became in our timeline. The Vietnam War is a lot more difficult to predict, but it's also very possible that it would either not occur; or be a Western victory.

So there you have it. At the very worst case scenario, a few million would have survived. In the best case, millions would survive on top of two wars being prevented and China, Vietnam, and Korea becoming democratic. I am not saying that Chiang Kai\-shek was a good guy, or that he deserved to win, or that his wining would have suddenly turned Asia into a utopia. Just that, based on what evidence I have seen, a Nationalist China would have saved millions of lives and possibly spread democracy as well.

If you want a delta, remain respectful. Don't be condescending, don't try to claim that your argument is ""just so obvious"" or that anyone who disagrees is stupid, uneducated, etc etc. It annoys me enough when people do that in other arguments, and this is a very opinionated and complicated topic. Also, giving credit where credit is due and solid, concrete examples are huge pluses. That said; don't be upset if I don't give you delta; I don't always give them even when I like the points made."	74	90

**I'm not arguing against the existence of two big parties, I'm arguing about the morality and validity of their policies.**
Let's look at some big issues and see where each party falls:

Abortion: Republicans fail pretty hard on this one. I can see how someone can view it as murder, but if we are talking about pragmatic policy, anti-abortion stances don't cut it in the real world. We've know for a while now that anti-abortion policies don't work, people will still get them and these policies do little to limit this.

Healthcare: The US lags behind the rest of the world on healthcare. Obamacare is not perfect but it is a step in the right direction. Republicans want to repeal it but couldn't come up with a replacement. They fail pretty hard on this issue.

Gun control: Again, the US lags behind the rest of the world on this. There is something to be said about gun culture and there are arguments on this but overall we are really stupid about guns in our country and the NRA has heavily bought out conservative politicians.

Climate change: Republicans time and time again align themselves against science and embarrass themselves when it comes to this issue.

Education: Need I say more.

Welfare: The US lags behind, again, everyone else. Supply-side economics and its various hydra heads have been slain by every leading economist since Reagan. We know that giving the rich tax cuts doesn't work. Republicans have failed their constituents by repeatedly passing policy that they continue to benefit from, leaving the rest of us out to dry.

War: Both parties in the US are extremely warlike, but conservatives moreso. I can't knock them much on this because dems can be stupid when it comes to foreign policy too.

~~Immigration: This goes without saying. Leading economists agree that immigration is good for the economy and that these often cited ""ill effects"" are fantasies. Republicans repeatedly fumble on immigration. Come on... a fucking wall?~~

Drugs: Not even going to waste my time on this one. Dems get the point of course.

Civil rights: ^

Prison reform: Clinton did continue the shit prison reform of previous republican presidents, but the modern parties are split on this issue. Republicans are involved in a toxic for-profit prison system that directly benefits them. Dems are the only possible way that this will be solved.

I could continue but this is the trend I'm trying to establish. What I'm not arguing is that the dems are perfect and loving politicians who always do the right thing, I'm arguing that they are the lesser of two evils. If any party is going to make positive change then the Dems will be our best shot.

**What won't convince me:**

Uncited rebuts of my points. Just saying that I'm wrong on any of these issues with proper citation won't cut it. I've done lots of research on these topics and I'm parroting every scientist and leading economist. Just stating that ""immigration is bad"" won't cut it, because every source has said otherwise. For example, just stating the fact that dems have not perfectly executed their strategy for helping poor black people is not a rebuttal. They are the only party trying. Just because the dems aren't perfect, doesn't mean that voting for repubs magically makes sense. Hence my title: The US has a one party system.

Bringing up other points is fine, but these are the linchpin issues I've brought up. A single point being disproven/brought up that contradicts my point won't cut it. I'm talking in generalities. I'm talking about who should get the vote. I need to be convinced that Republicans have the better overall policy.

~~Philosophy is not what we are discussing. Conservationism has some merit intellectually but we are talking about politics and hence, policy. I don't care about the philosophical implications of this or that, I care about saving lives and doing the right thing, the correct thing based on research on statistics. Again, dems don't do everything perfectly but they aren't a joke like the republican party.~~"	0	29

Political scientists, philosophers and economists have proposed various alternative forms of governance and we see numerous alternatives around the world. I do not see the point of continuing to uphold a democracy just for the sake of it, when technocratic governments or oligarchies are able to produce a better life for our societies. 

Not having to vote would take away a huge burden from our societies: Not only from the individual citizen but also from the politicians. Today, they have to act as if they are accountable to the people and as if they do not bend to lobbyists and corporate interests. In a technocracy, the ruling class could improve social life, implement all the measures that improve working conditions, alleviate climate change etc. 

My claim is simple, if everyone stops voting, there is no basis on which we can form a govenment and this will compel us to consider alternatives. "	0	26

They are a formidable measure of psychology and ethics, and give a convenient enough excuse so that the world does not find out about them. 

If we take vault 111 from Fallout 4, we learn that in the Fallout universe cryogenically freezing someone and then resuscitating them is totally possible. If we ignore the fact that some (most?) of the experiments went wrong (ex. the life support failure of vault 111), they better human understanding. In some cases, the misfortunes are a blessing in disguise. I’ll keep using the vault 111 analogy, the experiment was only supposed to last 180 days, however it lasted 210 years (for the sole survivor). This proves that cryogenic freezing is not only possible in the Fallout universe, it is possible for over 2 average human lifespans.

An ideal way, though certainly not the only way to do this, would be through a bill similar to FDR's Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937 . 

There is no constitutional issue preventing an increase in the size of the court, and while a slippery slope argument does have some merit, I find it difficult to see how those arguments lead to a situation that is worse than we have now. 

Today Judge Gorsuch was the deciding vote on the reversal of a forty year *unanimous* precedent on union rights. As a general rule, stare decisis suggests the court should not revist a ruling in such a way, so in and of itself this is exceptional. But it rises near to the point of absurdity when one factors in how Judge Gorsuch came to sit on the court.

In a complete break with all historical precedent, Senate Majority Leader McConnell refused to schedule any hearings on Barack Obama's nominee for the Supreme Court, citing a non-existent 'Biden rule' based in the argument that Joe Biden had previously said (when there was no vacancy and less than one hundred days from an election) that a hypothetical nominee might be put off. McConnell *did* put off the nomination of qualified centrist nominee Merrick Garland, effectively stealing a court nominee for the first time in US history. In the follow-up to the election, he then abolished the Supreme Court filibuster in order to make sure that Gorsuch could be confirmed with a simple majority. After all, he wouldn't want democrats to do something as scathing as refuse to vote on a nominee.

A president under federal investigation is now able to nominate his second justice, almost certainly a man, who will impact US jurisprudence and things as vital as the right to choose going forward until somewhere around 2050. Under these circumstances, I find it difficult to see any reason why democrats should not do everything in their power to correct the wrongs that have been done."	12	150

My friend and I were out on a weekend night. Light buzz. One of us had a Fallout Boy shirt on. A girl in line who was, I can only assume farther along in her night than we were, saw the shirt and told my friend “fuck you and fuck your shirt”. 

Now aside from the fact that she might not have put it that way or even said it at all if she was sober, my friend shot right back at her and made a comment about her weight where she promptly poured her drink out on his head. Thus getting escorted from the bar.

I personally feel that even though he probably could have picked any number of comebacks, that his was reasonable. 

Basically, if you are going to say something mean then you have then opened up the floor to the person you insulted.

I am open to being swayed in the other direction and obviously there are some things that would be absurd.

Every chip meets that criteria and so do Cheetos. Therefore, Cheetos are chips. However, my friend believes they still aren't chips and so do many others I talk to. But does a Cheeto not meet all criteria for being a chip?

Edit: Google defines a chip as ""a thin slice of food made crisp by being fried, baked, or dried and typically eaten as a snack."" I believe Cheetos would fall under this definition. "	14	113

We've already seen what happens when they try this. They tried shutting down the government over protecting DACA recipients, then caved after less than 24 hours. The current Democrats in Congress simply don't have the organization, the political will, or the ruthlessness to use this kind of tactic to make their policy goals happen.

If they get a majority in November they might be able to make their policy goals happen, but it won't be through this kind of tactic.

We have every reason to believe that Trump will use the Russians again in 2020 to influence the election outcome. In the age of electronic voting, imagine what the Russians could do to voting machines if they were able to so easily penetrate the DNC. In order to prevent, or at least mitigate any attempt by Russia to win the election for Trump via vote manipulation, we need robust Voter ID laws so we know \*who\* is voting and from where, when, etc. This will ensure a fair election where any attempt at further collusion or foreign interference will be stopped dead in its tracks.

**#CancelColbert**

""CancelColbert"" became a trending hashtag, thanks to Twitter activist Suey Park. The hashtag claimed that Stephen Colbert was racist for using ""ching chong chinaman"" as a part of his act, even though was obviously a joke meant to mock and satirize racists, not be one. The hashtag backfired and pretty much ruined Suey Park's life, as well as contributing to the over-sensitive social justice environment that most people agreed was terrible. But later it was announced that the humorous and successful Colbert Show would indeed be ending for unrelated reasons.

**Russian invasion of Ukraine**

In the first territorial conquest in Europe since World War II, in early 2014 Russia invaded and annexed the Crimea, and then went on to invade Ukraine. Obama didn't really stand up hard to Putin, he refused to even call it an invasion. The US and EU imposed some weak sanctions that didn't really do anything to move Putin.

**MH370 disappearance**

A large jet disappeared over Southeast Asia and no one has been able to find out. In addition to the loss of life, this was the start of a years long nightmare for the families of the victims, who have been tortured by endless inquiries and false hopes up to this day. It also resulted in a massive expenditure of resources in the search that ended up with nothing. 

**Rise of ISIS**

No explanation needed. The rise of an explicitly theocratic, and totalitarian state in the Middle East that would result in a great deal more violence, including the beheading of journalists, happened this year. It extended the Syrian civil war and ended any hope of a legitimate opposition to Assad.

**Newsweek Satoshi Nakamoto story**

Newsweek published a story claiming to unmask the founder of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, but this was proven to be false. All that was accomplished was an apparently unrelated man got a ton of unwanted worldwide attention, and the journalist's highest profile story of her career blew up, and millions of people were misled in the process.

**Michael Brown shooting**

An 18 year old African American man was shot to death by the police. This led to massive riots and unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, which ended up with yet another person dead, a police officer's life was ruined. The entire community of Ferguson was heavily damaged in the resulting violence, and racial tension exploded across the country after this. Polls of how people view race relations, which had been steady for decades, suddenly took a nosedive and we are still in a period of negative race relations now. 

**MH17 shootdown**

Some rebels supplied by the Russian government shot down MH17 - the same airline that suffered the MH370 disappearance. It's such a tragedy for the airline to lose two planes in one year, through no apparent fault of its own. The shooters will never be held responsible because the Russian government will protect them.

**Ebola Virus Disease**

Ebola is a horrible disease that makes you bleed from your pores until you die. But until 2014, it was thought to be confined to Central Africa and easily controllable to very small outbreaks. But that year there was a huge outbreak in West Africa that killed tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of people. They will be forgotten because they were born in a poor developing country. Also some of the brave doctors and nurses who went to help were at high risk and many of them got Ebola and died.

**Murder of Felina**

Felina was a twitter citizen activist who rallied her fellow Mexicans to report criminal activity in Mexico's drug war through tweets. In this year, the gangs somehow tracked her down, knocked on her door. They forced her to tweet out a picture of herself looking defeated, then later tweeted out a picture of her dead body from her account. The drug lords sent a message that they were king, and the drug war has been accelerating in Mexico ever since.

**#GamerGate**

A massive controversy erupted online over games journalism, a seemingly obscure topic that nonetheless marked the beginning of the alt right. A lot of people like Milo Yiannopolis and Mike Cernovich first started getting really popular around this time. The alt right had its first big wins and basically took over the Internet. This was the beginning of today's online alt right and alt lite influence. It also resulted in a lot of people getting harassed and bullied online with no effective defense.

**""A Rape on Campus""**

Probably the worst piece of journalism of the decade. Sabrina Erdely and Rolling Stone published a liar's completely implausible account of being raped by a fraternity at UVA. After going massively viral, after a week or two the story turned out to be false, Rolling Stone didn't even verify basic facts or try to interview the accused. The fraternity was defamed, and real rape victims ever since then have had a harder time being believed. The story damaged Rolling Stone so bad, it contributed to the magazine's being sold off a couple years later.

**Iggy Azalea called out for cultural appropriation**

Iggy Azalea, a white Australian rapper, was called out for cultural appropriation, which is when a person of the wrong race uses the cultural symbols or clothing of another group. This is a completely stupid controversy since culture is by nature fluid and every race has borrowed and borrows from what other groups have made throughout history. Yet it has become something people bully each other over. Iggy was bullied out of the industry despite having some great songs and doing what she loved.

**Republicans gain the Senate**

Alright, if you're a Republican you probably don't consider this bad news, but if you're a centrist or a liberal it's definitely bad, since it means that the centrist judge Merrick Garland didn't get confirmed to the Supreme Court and now we will have 5-6 or more conservative judges on the court, completely wrecking its balance. Even if you're a conservative, the fact that the Republicans didn't even hold hearings on Garland's nomination was wrong.

**Hillary Clinton decides to run for president**

Apparently in December of this year is when Hillary Clinton decided to run for president. The Hillary Clinton campaign was one of the biggest disasters in history. She had to go through scandal after scandal, and the end result was two candidates that the majority of the country didn't like. We've been going into a more and more divisive political time ever since then. 

In conclusion, 2014 was the worst year I'd say since 1997. Many negative events and/or trends started then, that are at the root of all our problems today. It's really remarkable how they all managed to happen in 2014. CMV.

Specifically, I’m talking about things like:

[student sent home for wearing braids](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/black-student-box-braids-sent-home-christ-the-king-elementary-school)

[Kid Loses National Honor Society Title for Wearing Spaghetti Straps](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/29/cameron-boland-fla-student-loses-national-honor-so/)

Note: I hate trump just as much as most of reddit but I still don’t think the kid should have been suspended

I think that dress codes in general tend to be sexist, restrict students’ freedom of speech, reenforce negative behaviors and mindsets

**1. Dress Codes are Sexist**

In my own anecdotal experience and the experience of many other people I’ve met dress codes disproportionately target women’s clothing and tend to be enforced more harshly and frequently against girls than boys. In many cases, these dress codes were written many years, sometimes decades, prior and have not been updated to reflect modern standards of modesty and dress. The many of the same clothes that would be considered inappropriate for school would be seen as perfectly acceptable in a church or a business setting (spaghetti strap or strapless dresses, shorts/skirts with hemlines above the knee, exposed collar bones, multiple ear piercings, etc). Not to mention it reinforces sexist stereotypes of women/girl’s bodies being inherently sexual objects that should be controlled and covered. Which leads me to my next point

**2.  Dress Codes Reinforce Negative Behaviors**

Instead of suspending children, pulling them out of class, or otherwise disrupting their education we should focus on teaching students to control their emotional and sexual behaviors. In life there will always be people wearing revealing or sexually provocative clothing. There will also be people wearing clothing with expressions or ideals that you find to be offensive and abhorrent. To be a functioning person in our society one must learn to control their own behavior and accept that they neither can nor should try to change or dictate the behavior of others. One must not let other people’s appearance, dress, or beliefs impede you from doing your job and living your life. I believe that dress codes in schools hinder children from learning this important lesson at a young age, which in turn creates less well-adapted, less open-minded, and more judgmental adults. Instead of saying, “girls should cover their shoulders because it distracts boys” we should teach children to focus on their studies and not spend all of class ogling girl’s breasts.  

**3.  Dress Codes Violate Free Speech**

In the trump example in the link above, the student was suspended for wearing a shirt that said “border wall construction co”, a reference to Donald Trump’s proposed wall along the US-Mexican border to keep immigrants out. While I 100% disagree with this statement and would be offended if I saw someone wearing such I shirt I acknowledge that it’s within their rights to wear whatever they want to wear. 
What about more extreme articles of clothing like Klan Uniforms (for non-US people see this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan)) or ISIS flags or swastikas?
I’ll acknowledge that such displays could be considered an indicator to incite violence or an intent to cause harm and chaos. However, they’re still protected under the 1st amendment and as long as the wearers don’t *actually* incite violence it should be allowed. I believe that in many cases people wear things like this in order to get some kind of reaction out of people. By simply ignoring such behavior and socially ostracizing such individuals, I believe that we can make a much more powerful statement that most people do not agree with and are not intimidated by such behavior. Also I believe that such extreme examples would be very rare. 99% of students just want to get through the day, learn, and/or see their friends. Especially for kids under 18, I seriously doubt that a child could be considered a true adherent of any discriminatory belief system. Children and juveniles have not yet developed the cognitive capacity, reasoning skills,  empathy skills, or had the life experience and education to understand the deeper meanings of some of these more offensive belief systems. They are often blindly repeating what their parents, friends, or the internet told them with out seriously examining or questioning it for themselves. In some cases kids do things that know most people will dislike solely for the purpose of getting a rise out of people. In both of these cases I think such forms of thought and actions can be better remedied through education and therapy than suspension and knee jerk punishments.

People should be held accountable morally and their fortunes, fame and reputation needs to be punished because as cultural celebrities, these people have significant impact on later generations and we shouldn't praise them also for being smart and dismiss their flaws as quirks and let them get richer and richer.

How do we, as a society, keep letting talents bloom and improving scientifically and culturally but also on a social level, have a better relationships morally and better role models? And personally, should I (or we) keep an blind eye for their ambitions and achievements despite their flaws? Could we have a better view on people like this and not just focusing on their achievements but letting everyone know what's not okay about behaviours?

Obviously CO2 emission is not distributed evenly among regions, countries and persons. The average emission per person in developed countries is much higher than in developing countries. According to the current scientific consensus, one of the main reasons behind climate change is CO2 emission.

&amp;#x200B;

The atmosphere by its very nature is a resource inherently shared by all human beings on this planet. Any CO2 emitted anywhere and anytime will eventually end up distributed evenly in the atmosphere affecting. All human beings inhale air, thus their health is affected by the composition of the atmosphere. Of course, there are many other ways how the atmosphere affects everyone's life through climate change. I just don't want to go into the details.

&amp;#x200B;

My belief is that not compensating other human beings for the CO2 we emit while enjoying the benefits of our industrialized civilization is simply immoral. How can any human being have more right to emit CO2 into the atmosphere than anyone else? If anyone can emit as much CO2 as they see fit, then we are going to be in a very big trouble soon.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I emit somewhat more CO2 yearly than \~4 tons (according to online calculators). It would be absolutely acceptable for me to pay as much as $100/ton/year in tax through the increased prices of goods and services. I'm not saying that it wouldn't hurt my budget, becaue it definitely would, but I can accept that.

&amp;#x200B;

I would expect this money to be distributed to every human being on the planet evenly instead of it being spent on various goverment programs. The incentive for reducing CO2 emission would already be built into the system by raising the prices of goods and services which emit more CO2. The CO2 dividend would simultaneously help the poor all over the world. For example, with the current emissions and $100/year/ton tax, every person would be entitled for $400/year, no matter where she lives. It would be a basic income. Obviously this would hurt the rich, so it's not something that is easy to implement.

&amp;#x200B;

Admittedly, this is very idealistic and it's obviously not my idea, but I think not implementing something like this is simply immoral."	2	66

Google defines ego as ""a person's sense of self-esteem or self-importance."" I personally believe that it is usually easier to work with people who have high levels of ego, as compared to people who aren't egoistic. Most people confuse superiority complex with egotism. People with superiority complex will try hard to make others believe that they are important. But Egoistic people, from that definition (and many other definitions I found online), must accept themselves as important people. 

The original reason for adapting this view: I'm someone who likes helping others. Some of the people I have helped, keep coming back to me, even if they aren't truly in need of my help. They don't realize the amount of time I sacrifice in helping them. I'm able to handle that now, but an important lesson I learned (apart from the lesson: ""avoid helping people who don't really need my help"") was: **people with more ego, who feel they are worthy and important, usually try to solve all their problems themselves to declare their self-worth and are thus reliable in a team effort**. Thus, in a team, people who have heightened view of themselves, would like to **own** their work to declare their importance among other members in the group. It will also be possible to create a competitive environment to improve their productivity. Also, if an egoistic person is ""lazy"", and tries to avoid work, it would be more easier to remove him from the team than removing someone who is more friendly and has less ego, but isn't productive.

What do you think? Is Ego a good thing?

Music, sports, languages, mathematics, popularity, social skills, memorization, science, arguments, and the list goes on. And of course these people are wildly popular and have a shitload of personality and are well-liked by basically everybody. And they don’t even need to try.

Now, I’ve also seen people who suck at everything. They try their absolute hardest, and they fail miserably. They crash and burn and never recover. Over and over and over again. They have zero personality or social skills and they are mostly “that weird kid” at the back of the room. They’re not smart, good-looking or interesting at all.

Yet despite this, people keep telling me that everybody is good at something, and that everybody is bad at something. I can’t help but feel like it’s not true, especially based on past experiences. 

Why is it that some people have to try hard and others don’t? Why is it that some people get effortless straight A’s and others have to fight against all odds to get a D-? Why is it that some people turn the heads of everyone for their remarkable and outstanding feats, while others are stomped into the dust? Why is it that some people have an entire room dedicated to trophies and medals that they’ve won in nearly every subject, but some only have of the participation ribbon they received when they were seven? How can people honestly tell me that everybody’s good at something and bad at something when I’ve seen it time and again that it’s not true. Am I just overthinking it? Am I just missing or looking over something? Change my view. "	2	20

I fully accept that there are a wide variety of other reasons to do so, including taste, habit, etc., but I am not concerned with those.  If you ask most people if caffeine improves their energy and focus, they'd say yes.  If you present the point that habitual caffeine use means there is no positive energy effect, you'd likely be ridiculed and the point would be dismissed.  I believe that this viewpoint is currently scientifically supported, and thus that habitual consumption of caffeine is detrimental towards this goal for the majority of people.

The following is my understanding of the mechanism through which caffeine functions, the mechanism through which tolerance builds, and excerpts from studies supporting the view that the primary benefits felt from caffeine are due to withdrawal reversal.  

Adenosine is a neurotransmitter that can bind to receptors in your brain.  Binding to the A1 receptor promotes muscle relaxation / sleepiness, binding to the A2A receptor interferes with dopamine and other neurotransmitters.  It builds up over the day and then dissipates while you sleep.

Caffeine essentially gets in the way and prevents Adenosine from binding to A1 and A2A receptors, meaning you don't get the tired sensations and lack of dopamine.  Additionally, caffeine leads to the release of adrenaline, further aiding alertness.^[1](https://examine.com/nutrition/how-caffeine-works-in-your-brain/)

Caffeine has a half life of three to ten hours, depending on the individual.  This means that depending on quantity/time of caffeine consumption, many people will have decreased sleep quality due to its presence.  Even if it's not enough to prevent sleep, it can still reduce the quality and start building up a sleep deficit. 

While that's an avoidable effect, caffeine use also causes the creation of more Adenosine receptors.^[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1888264)  This is thought to be the primary process through which tolerance occurs, and it makes sense that with a higher baseline number of receptors, your baseline alertness/mood are lower, and you need caffeine to block some of them to get back to a true normal.


Research into caffeine effects typically shows significant positives, until prior caffeine consumption is controlled for.  This indicates that the positive effects are primarily due to reversing withdrawal from consistent caffeine use.


&gt;The research also showed that avoidance of caffeine withdrawal symptoms motivates regular use of caffeine.  For example, **the satisfying feelings and perceived benefits** that many coffee users experience from their morning coffee **appear to be a simple reversal of the negative effects of caffeine withdrawal after overnight abstinence**.^[3](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/press_releases/2004/09_29_04.html) [emphasis added]

&gt;Caffeine reliably improved performance on a sustained attention task, and increased rated mental alertness, in moderate caffeine consumers who were tested when caffeine-deprived. However, caffeine had no such effects when consumers were no longer caffeine deprived. These data are consistent with the view that reversal of caffeine withdrawal is a major component of the effects of caffeine on mood and performance.^[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12424547)

This study even found evidence that caffeine wasn't even actually beneficial if you don't habitually use it, though they suggest that it should be tested further.

&gt;Testing the responses of caffeine non-consumers to caffeine administration is a method that can potentially demonstrate beneficial effects of caffeine unconfounded by caffeine withdrawal. The present experiments revealed no such effects, with the possible exception of caffeine-induced increases in self-rated alertness. In contrast, as well as increased alertness, a conditioned increase in drink intake reinforced by caffeine and significant effects of caffeine on overall mood and on psychomotor performance were found for caffeine consumers...

&gt;...Thus perhaps caffeine does substantially increase alertness independent of caffeine withdrawal.^[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12601503)

There seems to be significant evidence that habitual caffeine consumption leads to no benefit over habitual abstinence.

My stance on this could be changed if significant evidence against the withdrawal reversal hypothesis could be presented, or if my understanding of the mechanism could be corrected/expanded sufficiently to call into question the validity of the withdrawal reversal hypothesis.

Now a game regardless of what device you play it on, is there to serve a purpose and that is to entertain, I think we can all agree to that.

In recent years, gaming has not been restricted to just geeks/nerds/teens ...etc. Everyone in the household is playing, from your grandmother playing candy crush to your little brother playing Pubg. Lately I have been noticing that the community has been turning into some sort of elitist group. Maybe it was happening way before but it is then that I realized it.

If you go to any forum/sub reddit or even game chats, every hates a new player, calling them noobs even though everyone literally starts as a noob. If you want to be a ""gamer"" you have to play I don't know how many games, your moves have to be perfect, win every time and possibly have a YouTube walk through channel.

If you go and ask a basic question, you'll be hounded by how dumb you are, how that you can google it, and the competitive aspect of gaming has become cancerous, it is now a social humiliation if you're not good at a certain game, which is honestly ridiculous because in order for someone to win, the other person has a lose.

Look at the console debate, players literally get into fights if the other person chose a different device, if you go into online games there is ALWAYS that possibility you'll be insulted, called names ..etc usually your mother or sister will be involved in that insult.

If you dare criticize someone's holy grail of a game or a gaming company, you're dead to them. oh lord, how can you say that about Dark souls, the only true game in the world? *insert any game name instead, doesn't matter"". 

Also it's really unfriendly to women, if you're a female gamer you're either sexualized or ridiculed. because it is now a social belief that girls don't play, even though they actually do. They play the same games as boys. There weren't even Female/Male games when they started creating them, they had to put them in the boys section because that's how markets were at the time ""it's real, look it up"".

I could go on and on but you get my point, why can't we just enjoy what we enjoy?, take for example the reading community, of course it has problems but it's also welcoming, people share theories, if you're wrong they're mostly nice about it and not a full on asshole. They suggest to you your next read and I have never seen a word to ridicule a ""new reader""

This isn't about reading obviously, I just picked a community with a large amount of people that I felt welcomed in. Where in the gaming community, I couldn't enjoy some of the games because of the jerks that consider themselves ""gamers"". I honestly do enjoy solo games immensely.

I am open to discussions obviously, show me my bias, show me how I'm wrong :)

I understand that it’s just the internet and people have argued that proper use only really matters if you are writing a paper or an email to a boss or a colleague. But over a long enough period of time, improper usage of basic skills leads to the proper usage becoming forgotten. Right?

I *would* tip someone is to thank them for going above-and-beyond, or if I'm just feeling generous. But otherwise I wouldn't. If you listened to reddit, you would think this makes me a bad person. But it doesn't, and here's why:

1. ""But if you don't tip, employees will earn less than minimum wage!""
   1. Look at [this chart from the department of labor](https://www.dol.gov/whd/state/tipped.htm). You can see most states are either purple or green - this means that even if NOBODY tipped, tipped employees would still necessarily earn the state minimum wage. The blue states mean that if nobody tipped, tipped employees would earn the federal minimum wage. It is true that in most states employers can pay their tipped employees below the minimum wage, but *only if* their tips add up to being minimum wage or more. There is no legal situation in the US where a tipped employee earns less than the federal minimum wage. Note that many of the blue states on that graph are only blue because the state doesn't have a minimum wage.
2. ""But employers could illegally pay their employees less than minimum wage!""
   1. This is the case for any job. And you might think that employers of tipped employees are more likely to break the law, but if you really think there's a good chance that an establishment is ignoring very important state and federal laws, then morally and practically I'd say you should not encourage that behavior by patronizing them at all, let alone tipping their employees
3. ""But waiters and other tipped employees deserve that extra money!""
   1. Why? Nobody tips the busboy who helps clean up your table, or the dishwasher who cleans your plates.
   2. I worked as a waiter for over a year, but I was in a nursing home. Federal regulations say that employees of a nursing home are not allowed to directly receive any compensation from the residents - this means I was working as a waiter, for minimum wage, for over a year, and never received *a cent* in tips. And now I'm expected to go tip waiters unconditionally? Nothing waiters do is that special that they deserve special treatment in the form of tips
   3. I guarantee there are people who need or deserve your extra dollars much more than waiters. Do you also give money to every homeless person you see? Do you donate to [Deworm the World](https://www.evidenceaction.org/dewormtheworld/)? They both need it much more than some waiter is likely to
4. ""But if you don't tip, your friends will think you're a scrooge!""
   1. I don't have any friends

Given all these reasons, I see no compelling reason to tip. Please, change my view."	21	88	
changemyview	t3_9uuleq	https://www.reddit.com//r/changemyview/comments/9uuleq/cmv_the_woman_should_not_always_have_the_ability/	2018-11-07 01:15:46	Gyeff	CMV: The woman should not always have the ability to decide on abortion	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/9uuleq/cmv_the_woman_should_not_always_have_the_ability/	"I think that abortion should be viewed through a capitalist framework. That is, the person who owns the fetus gets to decide the fate of the fetus.

To use an analogy, if I purchase all of the ingredients for a cake and then bake a cake, the cake belongs to me, I can do whatever I want with the cake. There is a nuance to this however, if I rent my labor to someone else, my labor becomes an ingredient in the production of the cake, therefore the cake belongs to the person who purchased my labor.

The problem is that in the current system, society mistakenly believes that the woman owns the fetus. This is not the case. The woman used the ingredient of male sperm in order to build the fetus, therefore the sperm owner has partial ownership of the fetus. The woman cannot decide what to do with the fetus alone. STIPULATION: Verbal or contractual agreement prior to submission of required sperm about production of fetus.

The situation would be different if the woman bought the sperm. In that case she has full ownership of the fetus and therefore can do whatever she wants with the fetus.

Similarly, if a man gave the sperm and purchased a pregnancy surrogate, then the man has full ownership of the fetus. The man decides the fate of the fetus.

Finally, if an entrepreneur purchases both the sperm and the pregnancy surrogate, then the fetus belongs to the entrepreneur and he gets to decide the fate of the fetus.

The argument from anti-abortion advocates will be ""It's a human, therefore it's not a normal possession and therefore has to abide by special rules"". To this I ask, why? Why does it have to abide by special rules? What gives you the right to say it must abide by special rules and what is the special qualifier in humans that puts them under the umbrella of these ""special rules""? And who decides these things? Who decides that there is this special qualifier in humans and who decides these special rules? In my view, the anti-abortion advocate arbitrarily just ""made up"" these special qualifiers and special rules.

Now, if the anti-abortion advocates group together a number of like-minded heads and all agree on these arbitrary qualifiers and special rules and agree to commit violence upon anyone who disagrees, i.e create a state law, that's fine. But, don't lie and tell me that the rules aren't arbitrarily created by you and your group of like-minded heads. What I'm talking about here are the laws of capitalism, which I agree are man-made, but the capitalist framework provides some consistency rather than resorting to new arbitrary frameworks for a multitude of different circumstances.

To use an analogy to explicate the idea that humans don't fall under special rules based on special qualifiers: Imagine that slavery is an available option and I am allowed to obtain a slave either through purchase or through conquest. Am I allowed to do whatever I want with the slave including kill it? Clearly the answer is yes, because to whom else does the slave belong besides me? If the slave is not producing value for me, I have a right to kill it. 

By contrast, if I rent a person, there is an implicit contract suggesting that the seller's body will be available once again for future renting or for self-use after the rent period is over, so I cannot kill the rented individual.

In the case of the fetus, to whom else does the fetus belong besides the people who owns the ingredients: sperm, egg and womb. The fetus did not negotiate any rent contracts.

----
EDITS:

Added stipulation for first case (sperm or pregnancy surrogate is not purchased):

There is some kind of verbal or written agreement regarding production of fetus prior to submission of sperm as a necessary ingredient.

I'll explain.	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/9uun8e/cmv_conservatives_actually_want_govt_to_regulate/	"Note: I know the sub bio says ""mindset for conversation,"" but I'd really appreciate people trying to poke holes in my argument, so I can see if I can patch them. Also seems like that's the whole point of the sub, so not sure why that rule is there (I guess this part is a bonus CMV). To be clear, I'm not looking to debate, in case any mods are reading -- only looking to *converse* over *constructive criticism*.

**TL;DR**: American Conservatism is a set of principles that totally implodes on close inspection, and so conservatives therefore have not spent enough time reflecting on their views.

&amp;#x200B;

Conservatives miss it, but the three core tenets of American Conservatism are: stronger government regulation of big business, free public services, and freer immigration. I'll explain.

""Social conservatism"" upholds strong traditional values. By extension, *American* social conservatism upholds strong *American* values. America was founded as a nation by, for, and of the people. For the general good of the public. Corporations seek to make money, and historically have done this at any cost. Look at how the laissez-faire economic policy of pre-Industrial Revolution America mingled with a more modern economy: the middle class plummeted, labor conditions were horrible, and giant corporations held a huge segment of the public in a choke-hold. It was only after the *Republican* president Roosevelt used the anti-trust laws (and the rest of the government took other steps) to more heavily regulate businesses that conditions got better, and America was able to step closer to that egalitarian city on a hill it was meant to be.

America was founded *to be a utopia*. We can't forget that. When the rest of the world was stuck in the monarchical, royalist past, we went a different way: the way of the people and the future. If social conservatives really do uphold strong, traditional American values, they need to be like the Founding Fathers and prevent those with power from taking advantage of the public. Regulating business is a key step in this. When we set limitations on how much power any one person can have, both in government and business, we make it easier for everyone to be free. In the government, this means no private money funding political campaigns, limits on the power of the president, more transparency in the tax system, better public education, etc. In the private sector, we need to make it harder for one entity to rise to the top and monopolize it (think Google, Amazon, AT&amp;T, Comcast, Visa, etc.). Since a conservative wants a free market, they shouldn't want any one entity controlling a huge sector of that market.

A fiscal conservative wants people to get off welfare, right? Cut taxes, cut spending? Then they must want better labor and wage laws, and free education. If people want to work for a living, they have to earn a living when they work. That means raising the minimum wage. Now more people can afford to get off welfare and start building their own financial future. Since they have free education, more people can get degrees and trades now, too! And you know what else? Let's take a turn and cut some regulation: employers are no longer required to pay benefits. Why? Because in the interest of cutting spending, conservatives actually want to move health insurance to the public sector. I'll explain. The US government spends more money on healthcare for its citizens than any other nation on earth (double, in fact). Conservatives can cut spending and prevent this by making one giant healthcare pool and putting everyone in it -- lower rates for the vast majority, and less spending because people have been shown in other countries to seek better care, more often and sooner, after instituting universal healthcare. This makes for a happy, healthy public, which is what strong, traditional American values stand for. Not to mention you now spend $0 to some private-owned insurance company. So you end up saving money AND living healthier!

Conservatives also want God out of public schools, off public buildings, and erased from US currency. If they're Christian, they also want an end to public prayer. The constitution forbids the promotion of one god over another by the government, a practice unheard of at the time. By writing ""In God we trust,"" and similar mottoes, we put the Christian god above others and directly violate the Constitution of the United States -- breaking Rule #1 of social conservatives. This is also true in public schools. If they teach creationism, as many do, they must also teach every other religion's creation story. Or (and this is simpler), they don't teach any creation stories and opt instead for science. Remember America can't favor any one religion over any other, right? And Christianity's own teachings (King James, Matthew 6:5) condemn those who practice public prayer, so for the Christians among them, that's out too.

Finally, immigration. The Declaration of Independence holds ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that **all men are created equal**, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness."" It very pointedly does not specify ""all American men are created equal."" This country was founded by immigrants. Not only that, they were undocumented immigrants. So clearly the founding values, and arguably the most traditional, of this country are those of immigration: America wants people to come here and have a chance to live in the greatest country on earth. If conservatives uphold those traditions, they'll be happy to let people come and live here. As it stands, government regulations around immigration are INSANE. It's such a prime example of runaway government regulation, conservatives should be frothing at the mouth trying to streamline it. After all, these people often risk death just to come here, clearly the hard-working individuals on whose backs this country was built (remember the railroads?). So if social conservatives want to uphold the traditional, founding values of the country they love, they welcome all immigrants and asylum-seekers with open arms and not a mountain of unnecessary government red tape."	0	24

Instead of pushing women to be more like male players, change the womens game to better suit it's players.	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/9zcp2n/cmv_womens_football_is_terrible_even_at_the/	"I say this not because of some misogynist rant but because it really is terrible. I'm volunteering as a youth coach for boys U12s. After painfully watching a game of 'elite' women players it became very clear that the sport gets way more money and attention than it deserves for some unbeknownst reason. I've watched mens U19s and U17s play at regional level and I'll be brutally honest- those teens are an order of magnitude better. I think there's a simpler logic as to why. Not physiology as that is obvious, but to get good players you need a large pool of talent to sift out the best. Women's football does not have that even at grassroots levels so you end up with relative mediocre players abound. No fault of theirs though.

So I make a proposal to change the womens game so as to evolve the sport rather than expecting the womens teams to play at the same level as their male counterparts. Things like rule changes, transfers(something similar to a the draft in Basketball), uniforms and generally making the sport take advantage of women's strengths(Agility, technicality of female players is quite close to that of their male counterparts IMO). Football is generally slow to evolve, and modernising the sport through women's football would serve the sport quite well. And it would be exciting to watch(more eyes watching makes for better sponsorships), and less intimidating for girl players especially at the grassroots levels.

I have noticed that this view is unpopular, and would like to get some thoughtful responses on the topic. (I've discussed this idea before on 4chan's /r9k/ board, but I figured that responses here would be more constructive.)

Leaving the relationship is better for both you and your partner in this situation.

\*Why it's better for you:\* You don't waste your time with someone who isn't the right fit for you, and you don't build underlying resentment toward your partner when deep down you know you'd rather be with someone else.

\*Why it's better for your partner:\* You don't waste your partner's time by leading them on while you're actually more into another person. Breaking up with our partner may hurt them, but it's just cruel to let them continue give you their heart when you're not capable of giving them yours.

Also, since I've had this discussion before, here are some things that will not change my view:

1.  ""When you're in a committed a relationship, you shouldn't be looking for someone better to come along."" I wholeheartedly agree with this statement at face value, but it's not really what I'm referring to here. You don't always have to be actively ""looking"" in order to catch feelings for someone. I do also believe that you should leave if you feel the urge to start looking for someone new, but that is a separate discussion.

2. ""You shouldn't leave your partner every time you develop an attraction to someone else."" I also agree with this statement at face value. However, this doesn't really address my argument either; I'm specifically referring to times when you are more interested in the other person than your partner. Passing infatuations for other people may be normal in long-term relationships, but strong feelings for other people are reason to leave.

changemyview	t3_a2dz7n	https://www.reddit.com//r/changemyview/comments/a2dz7n/cmv_pantents_slow_down_technological_progress/	2018-12-02 15:15:50	Inconsequential88	CMV: Pantents slow down technological progress. Open Sourcing is the future, and should be a replacement.	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/a2dz7n/cmv_pantents_slow_down_technological_progress/	"I made this post a bit long because I wanted my explenation to be as clear as I could make it. 
So sorry for any grammar mistakes.

TL;DR: Pantents suck and should be replaced by open source. But legaly pantens overrule open source even if the pantent stole from the open source, because money. 

Oh and for those who don't know, yes physical hardware can also be open source. And yes it is profitable.
Just look at Adafruit Industries, one of the biggest succesful open source hardware companies out there.
They make millions anually and create tons of helpful free (or cheap) resources for people to use.

In my opinion, pantents prevent others from developing and improving on new ideas.
Not only do pantents support monopolies but they also create them, since it takes large amounts of investment in both money and work time.
Also the pantent owner gets a head start and leads to only a few companies dominating the market. e.g. nvidia and AMD are the only big PC GPU manufatcturers out there and the only reason why nvidia has a bigger market is because of its proprietary and immoral greedy tactics.
Patents are also expensive and take too long to approve of, which postpones development since there's a risk of patent trolling.
Which is also a huge problem with patents, large and wealthy companies are buying off and stealing inventions of others.
This is not a 'conspiracy theory' it's a fact, there was also a pantent on having mini-games on loading screens in videogames. 
Which is why until recently many videogames, including the ones with long wait times, did not have interactable loading screens (although there are some exceptions but they were only allowed if it wasn't a seperate game.
Pantents have resulted in bright ideas dying off because the right people who could of mended that idea to bring in something new to the world are suppressed by the 'owners' of the patent who honestly could care less.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_troll
https://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/everyday-innovations/patent-trolls.htm

The bottom line is money, the majority of CEO's only care about higher profits. They could care less if they stop helping people in need, as long as they make money it doesn't matter to them. 

However a better solution would be for innovators to make their inventions open source.
Not only does open sourcing inventions prevent monopolies, but it also promotes development as you have a comunity of like minded individuals working on solving the same problem. And it's possible that someone else can help with an issue you're having with the invention and even discover something new you would've probably missed.

Open source also has many ways of earning profit.
The fact that it is open source is reason enough that people would support the inventor.
Because with open source, the major way you would make money is by giving people what they want and making plenty of great things where they would donate to you the innovator for the excellent work done and to further improve on said work. While also giving it for free or at a less price to those who aren't really able to afford it.
Another main way of earning money is by using a GPL (or similar) liscense that would make it free to use your invention for non-commercial use.
Therefore you still make money when businesses use your inventions. 

However the biggest problem with open source is that since it is a new thing, it's possible that it won't be as easily enforced as pantents.
Which could result on someone else claiming your open source invention as their own with a pantent, and then suing you for using their pantented idea without permission. 
https://www.neowin.net/news/developer-claims-microsoft-stole-his-idea-and-now-earns-billions-from-it/

So what I think needs to happen is, inventors should move over to open source ideas and these ideas should not be ruled over by pantents just because someone with money said so. Just like Microsoft, they recently made around 60K of their pantents open source because it's a ""big part of our future.""

I know this is a completely biased opinion and I know pantents have actually done good in the past and their purpose back then.
But now we have the internet, a way for people around the world to instantly connect together.
And as the world and technology progresses further, so must we.

Now change my mind, please tell me why I'm wrong and why these pantent trolls and proprietary products are a good thing.
And please explain why it's acceptable for large companies like Google or Microsoft to conduct cyberespionage on someones private work and steal their ideas before they even begin to develop it in the first place?
https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/11/30/google_stole_my_patent/

Edit: Thanks everyone for your helpful input. My view has been changed. I used to think patents were selfish and slowed innovation, but now realize how necessary they are. However I still believe that there are improvements that need to be made like costs and approval time. But if I ever invent something big, I'll definitely look into getting a patent for it (while still making it open for non-profit use), and I'll instead just keep other smaller projects that aren't as important to me open source."	0	40

I will try my best to articulate my views. Please ask questions if you don't understand anything. 

I live in Bangladesh and I have a Bachelors and an MBA degree. I work at a large and prestigious bank in Bangladesh as an officer. Its a salaried desk job where the work is heavily clerical. 

I leave home at 7:45 am, work from 9:30am till 7:15pm or even 7:30pm and return home at 9:15pm to 9:30pm or more. I am called a relationship officer but my role is that of a universal banker. I process transactions, queries, account opening and even branch operations and everything. Basically all clerical work, at a very fast pace like that of a cashier handling 3-4 tasks at the same time. I am not allowed a snacks break and only get 10 minutes for lunch if customers are not nearby. So I get lunch at 1:30pm but sometimes even after 4pm. I am working constantly with not even a single minute for a mindfulness moment/relaxation break. I am not allowed to leave before 6pm or arrive later than 9:30am. There are training every other week on Saturdays for a whole day. I also must bring in sales outside office hours and on weekends--however I can to meet very large targets. I can't leave for an hour for chores that cannot be done outside work hours (say a government paperwork), I cannot go out of the office for fresh air anytime during the whole day, cannot use mobile phone, internet or even take a minute to write in my journal. Its like I am in a factory doing clerical work. My salary is not negotiable and paid according to company policy. I do not get travel allowance for sales visits. 

In my country Bangladesh, the labor code only extends to workers (if I understand the law correctly) but not to administrative workers or managerial positions (basically salaried people). So one could say that there are no safeguards for salaried personnel. In fact this lack of safeguards has meant abuse, oppression and exploitation of workers. Companies hold salaried people from 9am to 8pm, have them work on Saturdays and then have training days on Fridays. Many don't give them adequate lunch breaks or snack breaks and fire them for no reason or a made up reason. 

If I was wage worker, I would have got a 48 hour work week, an one hour break in an 8 hour day. There would be some (even though meagre) profit sharing, unions, strike possibility, a grievance and court system for termination etc etc. There is a [huge labor code](http://www.dpp.gov.bd/upload_file/gazettes/14212_75510.pdf) for wage workers that does not apply to me. The pay would be horribly poor at 10,000 a month, while I currently get 30,000 a month. But the laboringness of the work is the same, with worse conditions for me. 

Given the above context my point is that a salaried employment system is simply a way of bypassing wage laws and the decent work conditions the wage laws provide. The salaried system gives employers the leeway to do whatever they want with no safeguards like in the wage system. 

I really don't see how the salaried system is at par or better than the wage system. It seems like a system made for employers to bypass wage labor laws and squeeze workers to get more productivity out of them, working them to ill health and death. Its a system that oppress workers and a system that has a worse work conditions compared to wage labor minus the pay. Change my view.

Everything we experience is through our brain, our senses feeding our brain with information, storing experiences in our so called memory, inside the brain. It's electrical signals and impulses, super advanced stuff, but it's all happening in our head. Feeling happy? Sad? Angry? It's all just chemical reactions in your body and through your brain you experience those chemicals and phenomenon. When we die, there will be no more electrical signals and impulses, therefore we can't experience anything, we're just gone forever... it will be like sleeping without dreaming and never waking up again, just black, nothing.

So I'm not the most educated person in the world about depression, but these days it's used all the time and it makes me sick.

And I'm not at all saying that depressed people can wake up one morning and go ""oh well guess I better start looking after myself!"" And change it all.

And I am also not trying to undermine the suffering that one goes through, I've heard some horrific stories about this horrible condition and I wouldn't want it on anybody in the world.

But some people. Seriously grow up.

Or at least try, I'm not saying life is roses but the anti-depressant don't work if you eat junk food and watch movies every night. 

There is a lot of people that have been blanketed with ""depression"" when the truth is a number of people probably have ""attention seeking syndrome""

I apologise if someone reading this is going through a tough time and maybe taking it personally or to heart; I don't mean to offend you, the truth is I'm not super educated and I'm looking for a geuine CMV, feel free to message me if you want an uneducated arrogant little arse hole to help you out. 

Thanks for reading, really hope I can get something big from this and help me become much wiser in my travels.

Update: Please keep em coming, I think this is a really important topic, I'm going to be starting my overnight shift soon (Australian) so don't think I'm running away."	0	76

First post here. I've thought this for a long time due to the ridiculous amount of alcohol related deaths from drunk driving, alcohol related illnesses, and other alcohol related incidents like fights or other crimes. I don't see how anyone can make the argument that the social benefits of alcohol outweigh the negative outcomes.

For reference, according to National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism an estimated 88,000 people die from alcohol use a year, including nearly 10,000 traffic-related deaths in 2014. Alcohol was the third leading cause of preventable death, behind tobacco which is universally accepted as a net-negative product for society.

The only counter-argument I can see right now is that it is ingrained in western culture and is beneficial for improving social situations. To the first point, I don't care. Just because something is around for a long time doesn't mean it is a good thing. To the second, I say that is a small benefit for the cost of acquiring it."	188	183

My ex-girlfriend, Clara, has borderline personality disorder, and subscribes to Taoism. Most people would know about Taoism via the yin-yang, but actual its core teachings are about social harmony, acting spontaneously, and avoiding conceptualization. However, as with anything else, there are misconceptions and extremes that you have to be careful. In Clara case, these misconceptions nurture the disorder, and the core values of Taoism help her navigate in life. Because on the surface she is sharp and reasonable, a therapist cannot work out without having a solid understanding on Taoism.  

&amp;nbsp;

^(Just to get you a feel for the problem, for example, she admitted that she doesn't understand herself （a typical problem of person with BPD）. But when I talked about that, she used a teaching of Taoism to defend: a wise person is the one who knows nothing; you don't see me understand myself because you don't get that knowing is not knowing, and not knowing is knowing. I think even an expert in BPD would be confused before this.)

Therefore, insight played a crucial role in our relationship, if not the only one, and to grasp it I must have a long, stable time to research. I could assure her that I loved her, but for me claiming something without a solid understanding of it was unacceptable. I was so afraid to be wrong, even know deep down I knew I was right. Seeing there was no point to continue the relationship, 2 years ago I terminated it so that I can make it better the next time. She accepted my offer to end the relationship immediately.  

#FAQ  
###You are thinking too much. You haven't solved your insecurity/rumination/resentment
I didn't all live in rumination and resentment, but expanded my knowledge and core values. If I needed to psychoanalyze her, then it was for the knowledge that I didn't have before, not to resent ""why did you do this to me?"" My therapist was really confused for never seeing someone so sane like me (that's her word) and should have get over her long ago.  

To effectively solve the fantasy or resentment, I imagine she (or someone I have absolute respect) looks into my eyes and asks ""What would you do to beat this pain?"" Her gaze at me is sharp and cold; it cuts all my pains and shows that what I do is just to get something in return. The gaze is really scary, but I feel safe and be loved. I wouldn't want to disappoint her, yet I was disappointing her.  

###It's the excitement or enigma on the past that you're chasing after
We attach because both of us respect ration, knowledge, and wisdom, and tend to be open. Her part has nothing to do with me, and my part has nothing to do with her; they just happen to align together. It's a natural attachment of finding someone who can understand you, not because of seeking for companionship.  

###You are egocentric and full of pride. You just want to prove to yourself that you are right
###You don't concern her wellbeing, but just see her as a property. What you are doing only adds more anxiety to her
###You are harassing/stalking/preying/manipulating her
If I have ego, then I wouldn't ask you to question me, because the act of doing it requires me to worry that I have distortion. I have to have self-reflection, to face the shame of exposing my personal life and the fear of being wrongly accused, and to spend a huge amount of time and effort to analyze and craft it. All of this requires a very strong commitment for her wellbeing. The fact that I'm talking to you right now means that I'm not playing scenario in my head.  

I don't think wanting to expand my knowledge is viewing her as a property, or trying to eliminate my distortions is not concerning about her wellbeing. To concern her wellbeing, I have to concern on my wellbeing first. But when I concern about my wellbeing, I was accused for being selfish. A selfish person wouldn't spend time to actually understanding BPD and Taoism, and insists others to subordinate them.   

If I really don't care about her wellbeing, then I wouldn't have broken up with her.  

###It's not your job to help her. She doesn't need you in her life
Taoism, in itself, is a good philosophy. It teaches you how to become selfless and think about others before thinking about you, and it's popular in the East (our culture). It's just that if one does not understand it concretely, they will have misconceptions, and these misconceptions really align with the symptoms of BPD. So you have to solve both of them at the same time. This is why we broke up, because at that time both of us couldn't handle it. It's the lack of knowledge that leaded to the breakup, not because of being unfit with each other.  

Yes, it's not my job to help her, but she alone cannot help herself. She has her journey to understand herself, but the misconceptions of Taoism prolong her problem. The fact that she doesn't see how I can solve her problems does not mean she doesn't want them to be solved. I don't care if she needs me or not; I just focus on the problem and solve it. If it took me two years to get it, then she just cannot go anywhere without help.

###A lot of things can happen in 2 years
Yes, she has been through a lot of ups and downs in 2 years without me, but from my last observation (November), she still hasn't found a suitable partner, and doesn't show that she has solve her problem. I think she has accepted that no one can understand her.  

###You can't use logic into relationship
Actually it's her who use logic in relationship. She won't accept cliché like ""let's bygone be bygone"", ""the heart has its own logic"", or ""perfect is the enemy of good"", because it doesn't solve anything. If you cannot prove that you have a long-term solution, then she won't accept. This is why we attracted each other.  

There are many factors contributed to our attraction, and one of them is **cognitive psychology.** Cognitive psychology is the study about how knowledge is organized and retrieved in our mind. Because her life is full of chaos, what she needs most is the insights on how her mind works. At that time, I only had a primitive understanding of cognitive psychology, and I even didn't know what I needed to know. All I knew was that this field existed.  

If you want to know more, check out my research: [A theory of perspective](http://lyminhnhat.com/2018/12/21/a-theory-of-perspective/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=Change%20My%20View&amp;utm_campaign=Perspective). It answers the questions that we both inquired but didn't have a satisfactory answer back then. Without those answers, both of us will feel dissatisfied. 

#OK, what do you want?  
I want to know why you haven't been convinced yet.  

Please note that when you form your skeptical thought, it is likely that is has been addressed in a different form. For example, these comments:  
 
* This is stalking  
* She doesn't want you in her life    
  
are just the same idea in different words. However, it is still useful for me to know, so if you have a variation, just tell me.  

**Why do I have to convince you?**  So that when facing the most skeptical person, I can say this: ""I have convinced the internet successfully. Here is the link: _______""  

I intend that after convincing you I'll send the message to her friend. But first, please help me see the holes in my logic.

People's personalities are a factor of nature and nurture.

Personalities are an important factor in overall attractiveness, compatibility and the ability to find love.

Let's ignore nature for now because it is difficult to define and instead discuss nurture. Also, nature is a constant variable that hasn't changed.

When we had more distinctive gender roles between sexes men's nurtures were developed such that they found women with specific qualities attractive. These qualities were qualities that women developed due to their nurture that was quite specific to the gender role. Women also developed a nurture which found certain qualities in men attractive and men developed these specific qualities as it applied to their gender role. 

It is like raising a bunch of men as negative numbers to like positive numbers while raising women as positive number to like negative numbers. While it's true you'll get some variability where some men ended up a positive number and some women ended up a negative number, overall the variability would be lower and everyone would fit within the box more readily.

Overall the nurture worked such that it created a situation where more men found more women attractive and more women found more men attractive when compared to now.

In today's society, people are nurtured to be equal with a diverse set of potential traits. Now you have positive numbered men who like negative numbered women and all sorts of variation which actually reduces the number of people you are compatible with which reduces your likelihood of finding love.

The positives gained by a more unstructured and equal society does not outweigh the loss from being less compatible with more people.

Note: Yes there are homosexual people and this current society may benefit them more but they also only represent 2-7% of the general population so what's good for homosexuals isn't necessarily good for society as a whole. "	0	33

There is a potential that they won't care, because my income is still being reported, and I'm ultimately still responsible for - and will pay - said taxes (because I live in a society). Given that, the whole gesture may pretty much be a waste of my own time (both now and next Jan-April), and they will neither be affected, nor care.

On top of that, while I am not in the following group, a lot of people live paycheck to paycheck (if that) and might end up spending the money, and then end up owing tens of thousands of dollars that they don't have any more. So I don't really recommend doing this unless you're doing well financially and have good self-control with your spending.

But I'm fucking irritated, and I feel like I should do /something/.

I suppose the most direct route to changing my mind is altering this impulse to something more productive. Thoughts?

**Edit:** So, technically my ""view"" has changed from a practical standpoint (vis a vis, I can't do what I wanted to do, because Federal is pay-as-you-go whether I want to or not, and I live in WA so I don't have state tax either way). My moral dilemma remains, but it doesn't seem like anyone is keen to address it, so... I guess we're done here?

**Edit 2:** Ok, apparently I am (or rather, my employer is) only obligated to pay quarterly if my estimated liability says I need to, but if I change my exemptions to something higher, the estimation will be zero. The real value will be calculated at the end of the fiscal year and I can pay then. Technically, my original plan would still work, be legal(ish?), potentially net me some interest during the year, and probably still not phase the government (unless a bunch of people did it at once). Some very good points being made, so I guess we're not quite done here...

Also, it's the middle of the night and I woke up randomly. I saw the replies in my email, but I'm putting off responding directly to them until the morning proper (because sleep), but I will :)

**Edit 3:** Insomnia. Replied. Wee.

Keep'er goin'...

**Edit 4:** Holy fuck. Ok, someone please verify this thought I just had: Without getting into specifics, I make six figures. That means my liability is tens of thousands of dollars each year. If I hang on to that, and make just 1% interest in a year, that's THOUSANDS of dollars of interest that I'm giving away.

If the only thing we accomplish here is that I pay my taxes on full, but keep that interest, I consider that a win.

**Edit 5:** Yeah that was some huckleberry-bad sleepy-time math. It would have been potentially HUNDREDS* of dollars xD

\* Maybe, if I was really careful and deliberate.

But some good hints to look into investing. Not 100% on track, but good advice non-the-less.

Speaking of the thesis, responses seem to boil down to the following;

* You have to pay federal tax with each paycheck if your estimated liability says so, but;
* I could technically pull this off if I modified my exemptions, but;
* Modifying my exemptions inaccurately is still illegal and fine worthy (despite most people getting away with it because it's not often pursued), and;
* It would probably be a huge hassle, and;
* Since I'm paying anyway, and there isn't a massive amount of others doing this, it wouldn't really matter, but;
* It's good to think about civil disobedience and take interest and participate in your government, generally.

Auxiliary tip:
* If one has a fair amount of paycheck surplus generally, they should invest (safely, I'm thinking 401k and CDs, etc).

Anyone else have something to add?"	337	102

Its MLK Day? Ohhh."" Which leads me to believe that MLK day is one of the least, if not the least memorable holiday in the states. I would say that its a generational thing and that the memory of MLK's legacy is not as relevant in the minds of people today as it was in the 1980s when the holiday was created, but that would not account for the fact that most other popular holidays are centuries older than MLK Day and are still enthusiastically celebrated. You could also say that other popular holidays are tied to specific faith based practices and therefor have long lasting cultural support. But that doesn't all the way explain the popularity of things like Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christopher Columbus Day, Presidents day, Memorial, Veterans day and the 4th of July.  Even holiday's that have a more ethnic/cultural association, like Kwanzaa St. Patrick's Day and Cinco de Mayo have a more celebratory vibe than MLK Day which is usually acknowledged, with the exception of some businesses closing their offices, through a brief sizzle reel of MLK's highlight's on the news. As often as people site the ""...Content of a person's character"" quote, it's not as if American's don't know who MLK was or not respect and acknowledge value of his legacy. I could just be that MLK Day happens right off the heels of America's premiere holidays (Xmas/NYE). Whatever it may be,  I'm convinced that MLK is the most forgettable of the American National Holiday's."	0	24

Objectively those are low effort comments that add nothing of interest to anyone, yet they show up at the top of almost every YouTube video. I'd imagine that if there was a functional dislike button these comments would be disliked to hell before the young kids who don't know what they're doing find them.

This relates to lectures that are primarily a professor providing a lecture in a one-sided fashion towards the students. This can include lectures with questions asked to students, but the main source of information is not the discussion that arises from student-professor interaction. This does not include lectures that rely on this interaction, language courses, labs, group-based courses or other interactive courses. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a TA at my university and have noticed a sharp rise in lecture courses having attendance count for as much as 10% of the grade. I feel like this is pointless and serves nothing else than to add bodies to the lecture hall. Forcing attendance even comes across as demeaning at times and treats these adults as high schoolers. I teach a freshman level lab alone, this course makes sense to require attendance as it is a hands-on course designed to teach and have students demonstrate proficiency in certain lab techniques. The materials in the lab are not available at home. However, I just sat in on the intro to bio lecture that has an attendance policy. I feel like this is pointless, the powerpoint is put online after and nothing within that room is exclusive to that room. Even if it was, if someone aces the test does it matter where the information came from? The attendance is enough of the grade that not going to class and getting 100% on everything else will still give you a 90% in the class. This is usually not feasible, so a potentially brilliant student who fully understands the material could get a 98.9% on all the tests but due to not going to class receive a B+ opposed to an A. Many of these students want to pursue graduate programs where a B+ is a low grade to receive. All this does is bring students who do not want to be there into the lecture, creating distractions for others. If a course doesn't even provide all the knowledge in lecture outside of lecture but a student does well, can you say they don't understand the material? I could sign up for a physics course, never attend, and study everything in the course outline and fully understand it. Do I know less than someone who attended daily? The grades at the end would suggest I do, falsely. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some of the arguments that I've heard in meetings to justify this. ""This ensures responsibility for our students"" The intro to bio teacher is not the person who is responsible for making sure these adults are responsible. ""Not attending is disrespectful"" Attending for the sake of it is more so. ""Higher level education requires attendance"" Many medical schools have a single note taker and one or two students out of the entire class in attendance, these are students who were selected for their proficiency in academics and attendance is not taken as seriously it is at a freshman level. 

&amp;#x200B;

I suspect a large portion of this stems from professors taking it personally if students do not show up. They assume this is due to a lack of enthusiasm when it is not a direct correlation. Overall I would never be able to assume someone's attendance based off their knowledge in the subject. I have worked with brilliant PhDs who never went to class and are well known in the field and I also went to undergraduate classes with people who attended daily and I wouldn't trust to spell my name without me double checking. All of this suggests attendance isn't a solid metric for assessing knowledge in a subject.

DAWs, VSTs, soundfonts, etc. I don't have money for it all.

I read somewhere that it's okay to use pirated software because the producers aren't going to get after you for it, due to jursidiction limits, evidence restrictions, and a lack of interest in spending the time and money going after small fry copyright violations.

If buying the software supports the company financially, then apparently, as far as supporting the original software developers goes, buying the software legally actually hurts them by strengthening the status quo of exploitative employment practices and intellectual property ownership, and it's better to actually just send the individual developers money if your intention is to support them, and circumvent the exploitative business they're employed by altogether.

And as far as money goes, most of their money comes from licensing their product en masse to other companies, not selling licenses to individual users.

I see the reasoning here, but I still feel like there's something said that refutes all of this, and I'm wondering what it is.

One could buy a complete review for an AP class for ~$15 from Princeton Review and just study that and pass the AP exam. It is clear that their pricing is directly related to the fact that one is forced to buy their product. If one did not have to buy their product, no one would willingly buy it. I am not against paying for learning material, but I wish that I had an option.

Several times growing up, when I had colds or the flu, they would say, “just pray” and wouldn’t take me to a doctor unless I was passing out or in agony. It never got bad enough that I was in danger of dying, but I know what it’s like to feel like garbage and have your caregivers tell you that you’re just not praying hard enough. 

Anyway, my stepmother and I are very close and really the only opinions we differ on concern religion (she’s loosely catholic, I’m agnostic). We were talking about a report that I’m doing for an ethics class concerning the death of a 2 year old girl whose parents refused to take her to a doctor because their faith “forbid it”, and the death of a newborn in Oregon for the same reason. In both of these cases the children were sick for a long period of time and all they did was pray and “anoint” then with oil. Long story short, the parents in both cases are being charged with neglect and manslaughter/murder, and I support that decision because it’s ridiculous to me that you could watch your child wither away to nothing and eventually die due to “God’s Will”. (This is a 3000 level college class and what follows is a civil debate, and I’m simply presenting the facts and then leading a discussion with everyone’s opinions. My own opinions aren’t in the presentation itself, and I have to review it with my TA to make sure it’s relatively unbiased). 

My stepmother lost it and said I was being cruel and not thinking about the pain the parents were going through, what it was like to lose a child, etc. I tried to explain my opinion, that if these parents actually cared about keeping their kids alive they would actively try to keep them healthy, but she just repeated that I‘m being cruel because I don’t understand what it’s like to have faith. 

Does anyone have an opinion here that I’m just overlooking in favor of my own? How can I have more compassion for these people?

changemyview	t3_asxwxd	https://www.reddit.com//r/changemyview/comments/asxwxd/cmv_social_media_banninghiding_conspiracy/	2019-02-21 03:09:05	GreyWormy	"CMV: Social media banning/hiding ""conspiracy theories"" is insidious."	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/asxwxd/cmv_social_media_banninghiding_conspiracy/	"The word ""conspiracy"" is often used to demean an idea as being outlandish or plainly false. This is an incorrect definition. A conspiracy refers to a secret plot, often to do something illegal or harmful. A theory of a conspiracy then is a supposition that someone may be making a furtive effort to do something wrong. There is nothing about the term that means a conspiracy theory must be outlandish or unbelievable. I **need** to express to you that the way I am using the term is purely by-the-book and not in any way meant to denigrate or cast doubt upon anything described as such, so please take no offense here.

So what's a modern-day conspiracy theory? The Trump collusion is one example; it is still a theory as the Mueller investigation is not yet closed, and it is in regard to a secret plot by Trump to collude with Russia to get a better foothold on the US.

Another conspiracy theory is that Jussie Smollett faked a hate crime in order to gain some attention. He has not yet been convicted of this alleged secret plan of his, so it is still just a theory.

Are these conspiracy theories to be removed from the likes of Facebook and Youtube? I think they should not, and it would be monumentally dangerous to conceal these topics from the public.

At first glance, one might see a headline about Youtube not recommending conspiracy theory videos anymore and you would think, whatever, who cares about flat earthers and birthers anyway?

But the title of ""conspiracy theory"" will cast far too wide a net and will not just quash people wearing tinfoil hats. Once upon a time, Watergate was a conspiracy theory. So was the idea that the CIA was supplying crack cocaine to the inner cities. Today these are matters of fact, but back then, when conversations about the subjects *really mattered*, they were still merely conspiracy theories. Hindsight isn't 20/20. We do not know which conspiracy theories of today will be the facts of tomorrow.

""But,"" you may ask, ""isn't it better to not promote these stories until enough evidence comes out so that they are no longer just theories?""

I argue no. Today, journalists live and die on social media. They are, in fact, the major medium through which journalists do their work. Banning or hiding any video or article because it contains suppositions about a possible conspiracy is akin to a newspaper journalist in 1972 being told by their editor that their article on Watergate will never be run. I hope it is plainly obvious why that would be a problem.

Because after all, what's *wrong* with a youtube video about how the moon landing was faked? For any of you who disagree with my sentiment here, please tell me in your response whether you are afraid that you'll be swayed into believing this theory if you watch a video about it. Seriously, I want to know. My money is on that your answer will be something like ""no, of course not."" The implication then, if you think moon landing hoax videos are harmful but you're confident they will never alter your opinion, is that you believe yourself to be a better judge of the truth than others are.

I ask you then, who are you, or the CEO's running social media, to act as gatekeepers for what other people are allowed to see and hear? How are you so certain that Mark Zuckerberg is such an expert on the truth that he should act like your parent and dictate what you're allowed to be exposed to?

Reasonable people will not be convinced by moon landing hoax videos and unreasonable people will find bizarre things to hypothesize about anyway. This state of affairs will not be changed by what stories we are exposed to on social media. What we all *will* be exposed to is that elephant in the room.

Recall when I pointed out that Trump colluding with Russia is a conspiracy theory. Has this subject been hidden from social media? No, of course not. Typing ""Trump Russia"" into the Youtube search bar yields thousands upon thousands of videos on the subject with multi-million dollar media channels at the very top of the list. This is totally fine in my opinion, but this shows, without a doubt, that banning ""conspiracy content"" is actually about banning subjects that the bosses of social media do not want you to see. Some conspiracies, it seems, they favor more than others.

Now if you are of the right-wing persuasion, your reason for fearing this development is obvious. If you aren't, and you are fully onboard with this effort to keep this conspiracy and others like it on the front page while quashing others, I argue that you aren't looking where you're headed.

It is true that, currently, Silicon Valley is largely left-wing and does promote left-wing ideals. This *will not* always be the case. There will come a day sometime in the future when the pendulum will swing the other way, and social media will be controlled by the other side. In this juvenile stage of social media, I argue that we do not want to cement them as the custodians of thought. One day, if this is the set standard of social media, they will absolutely use this precedent to conceal content that is harmful to Emperor Donald Trump VII.

This is not an implausible future. After all, we got Trump right after we had Obama. Two more opposite leaders you cannot have imagined. And you could doubt that the same could happen to the social media industry?

To sum up, Facebook and Youtube acting as gatekeepers of information is dangerous. It will prevent journalists from exploring different angles on stories. It goes lightyears beyond their actual function; mediums through which people can connect with others and share content. They are not impartial about what information they promote and which information they hide. They are the unelected masters of a platform that openly hide content they disagree with, and they will not actually ban all conspiracy theories as they say. Further, there is no assurance that the kind of content they disagree with will not change, so everyone of any persuasion has reason to fear this development.

But...they're allowed to do it. It's their platform, their property, and whatever they say goes. But being allowed to do something doesn't make it a good idea.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: There are a lot of people questioning my definition of a conspiracy theory. They all make good points, and it is unlikely that social media companies plan on censoring any content that is just a hypothesis about shady dealings, and are likely referring to content with blatantly false or misleading information.

My response to this is simple: There's no way these companies can develop a system that is sophisticated enough to tell the difference. Moderation of content is done with computer algorithms, not by people. 2.1 million posts are made to Facebook every minute. 60 hours of video are uploaded to Youtube every minute. There is no workforce on the planet with the manpower to moderate all of it. This is why an automated system will be used instead. This presents several problems, because an algorithm cannot tell if content is a well-reasoned look at a subject from a new angle or an outright fabrication. I submit then that using the definition of ""conspiracy theory"" to mean something that is self-evidently false is pointless; all of it will be caught in the crossfire.

If you want a recent example of this exact thing happening, [here you go](https://www.advocate.com/media/2017/3/23/no-one-can-explain-why-youtube-bans-some-lgbt-content)."	53	111

However I think that in a choice between increasing the minimum wage and using taxes to increase transfer payments to low income people, the transfer payments are much better, for two principal reasons:

1. If there is a political decision to use government power to help poor people, it is more efficient and equitable to spread the cost among the whole taxpaying public as opposed to concentrating it on the particular employers involved in lower wage industries.  

2. Concentrating the cost of providing higher incomes in specific employers is likely to produce large disemployment effects meaning lots of people lose out when they lose their jobs or can't find new jobs that pay the legal minimum wage. 

I think if you want to give people a better income, the route is not a minimum wage but something like aggressive EITC expansion as, e.g. Kamala Harris is proposing.

They have their reasons or arguments, which respect cuz it is their choice, but nothing will sway me to support the idea of not vaccinating your child. 

I can't ignore how vaccines have helped mankind for decades. I can't ignore how the vaccines have completely eradicated mortal diseases in places all over the world. I can't ignore how ignorant the anti-vax movement is! How it puts a lot of people at risk!

I can't not vaccinate my child out of fear for their life or well being. Vaccines are chemicals, SO IS EVERYTHING ELSE YOUR CHILD CAN COME INTO CONTACT WITH. Literally everything and anything your child comes into contact with can cause a reaction that can put your child's life in danger, may it be food, clothes, animals, or germs. You can't protect your child from everything they come into contact with, mainly because you have no idea what can cause a reaction. The body is chemicals and everything that exists has chemicals, and *God forbid* that those chemicals don't get along. It's not your fault or your child's fault that this happened, BECAUSE IT JUST HAPPENS, ALL THE TIME WITH ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING. How can you be so ignorant? 

The whole autism/mental/learning disorder argument infuriates me. It tells me that those parents would love their child less if they had a disorder. If you wanted to be a parent, I would figure you would be prepared to raise and love them no matter the cost, but all this tells me that these parents dont want to deal with the extra work of raising a mentally handicapped child and won't love them. IF YOU AREN'T PREPARED FOR ANYTHING LIFE CAN THROW YOU WHEN YOU HAVE A CHILD, DON'T HAVE ONE! They might face struggles to exist with their disorder/handicap, WHATEVER, that's why it's your job to help them! You are supposed to, right? How can you be so ignorant?

This place is basically a 'metric heaven' where pretty much all our measurements are in SI (or derived) units. We drive in kilometres per hour (km/h), we measure our weight in kilograms (km), we \[should\] measure our height in centimetres (cm), large drinks are sold by the litre (L) and small with millilitres (mL). Our food is weighed in grams (g) and our temperatures are in degrees Celsius.  


It's not just our engineers and scientists that use metric, but everyone in their daily lives. We seldom use imperial for anything.  
Just listen to any Aussie and you'll hear things like this:  
""I lost 20 kilos last year!""  
""I got fined for doing 67 k's in a 60 zone.""  
""I'll get a 400g steak cooked medium please.""  
""They say it's gonna be bloody hot today, like 37 degrees!""

&amp;#x200B;

But of course you might also hear...  
""He's like 6 foot 3... that's like 185cm or something,"" (It's actually 188cm)  


The point is that Australia doesn't just use metric for science and exports, **but also casually, in our daily lives.**  
This could have been a reality for the United States if pirates didn't steal their kilogram from France in the late 1700s. It's also a shame that they pulled the plug on metric conversion in the 1970's.  


  
So here are my arguments as to why America needs to go the extra 1.6km and abandon their customary (imperial) units:  
1. **The rest of the world is metric** \- apart from Myanmar and Liberia. Actually, they're seriously considering switching.

2. **Imperial units from the US seep into metric countries** \- Australians have to measure screen sizes in inches, although we have trouble working with them. Thankfully, most packaging displays screen size in centimetres too. Our nautical speeds are in Nautical Miles (and we boat in Knots), likely due to Imperial influence that's beyond our control. Aviation? I wouldn't touch that with a 3m pole!  
3. **Conversions are difficult** \- 1 km = 1000 m. 1m = 100cm OR 1000mm.   
1 mi = 1760 yds. 1 yard = 3ft. 1 foot = 12 inches.  
4. **Imperial units are actually defined by metric** \- 1 inch = 2.54cm, BY DEFINITION!  
5. **Metric is MORE convenient in real life** \- 1cm is about the width of a fingernail. A handful of sand weights about 1kg. An arm's length is about 1m. Metric units are just as relatable as imperial! It also is more precise on packaging as we can see that a 650ml bottle is slightly larger than 600ml. It's not trying to fit into the larger fluid ounce.  
6. **Easier to learn** \- kids spend less time learning measurements in school and more time actually using them

Presidents go campaigning across the country and promise things to the people in different states. They promise things that aren't the most important for the country, but they'll have an impact on the people they're visiting, and that's all those people care about.  


I think the president's job should be running the country, not appeasing the people. If you can't tell, I'm not a huge fan of Trump, because I think the only reason he got elected at all is because he appeased the people, and he had a ton of money to support his campaigning in order to do it. But this isn't an anti-Trump post, it's a post against the current political system, it's a post against the campaigning style of elections.  


I think that the people who should be concerned with the welfare of the everyman are the county officials. Possibly the state as well, but I think that's as high as it should go. I think people higher up than that should have as little support from the general populous as possible. Yes, they'll be deciding on things that affect everyone like medicare, but that should only be their priority if it's important for the country, not because it's what the average joe cares about. Those are two different things.  


The solution I propose is a recursive system of voting. Your average citizen will vote only for the officials in their county. They in turn will vote for the state representatives, and they in turn will vote for the president and any other country-level officials. I think this would be a much healthier way of voting. If politics were a game and I were the game developer, I would view this multi million dollar campaigning as an exploit of bad design.  


However, I am me and it's a lot harder for me to find flaws in my own ideas, so that's why I posted here. I'm not looking to drop my view entirely, although I'm certainly willing to if enough of you point out that it's a shitty idea.

&amp;#x200B;

Bill Barr is a man who said many months before he became attorney general that Trump firing Comey (and Trump doing things that are obviously intended to stop and block criminal investigations into himself) are **not obstruction.** Because the constitution gives the president power to do that. Bill Barr said in his essay: As president, he has the power, the decisions are not reviewable, so we must obey, *even if he is doing it to save himself from criminal prosecution.* That's probably why Trump picked him as AG.  The president has the absolute right to order the justice department ""Don't investigate me."" in Barr's view.

Barr's summary of the Muller report said ""The investigation did not establish that Trump or his associates conspired with Russia.""  It only said we didn't find enough evidence of collusion during the election, but nothing about inappropriate action after the election. It did not say anything about:

* Is Trump under any kind of pressure from Putin right now?
* Is Trump doing things to benefit Putin against America's interests?
* Is Trump a security risk right now?
* Why so many contacts between Trump campaign and Russia?
* What about Paul Manafort sending polling data to Konstantin Kilimnik? Who ordered Roger Stone to contact Wikileaks? What were the conclusions on those matters?

In fact, the fact that it DIDN'T say these things is deeply concerning. Why didn't the Barr summary address these issues? **If Trump was not bowing down and kissing Putin's ass, the report would have said that.**

In my view, all we've seen is a **summary of a report written by a man who believes he must obey the president even if the president is self-dealing.**"	29	84

I also get uncomfortable when she dances with other people.  It would be beneficial to both of us if I could loosen up about it. 

Basically I can't help but view dancing as sexual to some degree.  Some dances more than others, but all of them at least a little bit.  Most dances for pairs I would place somewhere between flirting and foreplay if I were to try to place it on that scale.  

The features of dancing that make it seem sexual:

- Two people focused on each other
- In close proximity, touching frequently if not constantly
- Moving their hips with synchronicity
- One person leading and the other (for lack of a better word) submitting
- Movements often stylized in a sultry, provocative and enticing way

We've even gone ballroom dancing which is formal and stuffy as hell and I still got weirded out by some other dude guiding my girlfriend around the room by her hip.  

I think the source of this view is that I don't enjoy dancing, and therefore the *only* reason I would do it would be as part of putting the moves on someone.  I don't find any joy or pleasure in dancing for dancing sake, so I have a hard time relating to people who do.

The best way to change my view would probably be to point out another activity with similar traits that is not viewed in this way.  But I'm open to any argument that makes me seem like less of an insecure weirdo :)

edit; To be clear, I'm talking about couples dancing.  Or at least dancing with someone else.  I don't think that dancing by yourself, for yourself, is always a sexual thing."	58	117

So if you don't want spoilers don't continue.

Anyways I've had many people saying they were upset that the MCU seems to be whitewashing the role of Ironheart by foreshadowing the idea Morgan takes on the mantle

Imo this is an appropriate outcome since she's Tony's daughter

Riri Williams may still play a part in the MCU version, especially since Morgan is currently only 5 years old.

We don't know yet how the role will turn out.

Who knows if Riri Williams starts with it and passes it on to Morgan when she grows up so she can follow in her father's footsteps. 

It's not like certain heroes haven't passed the mantle to someone else before in comics. It happens all the time.

Maybe Riri Williams stays in the MCU becoming Morgan's Rhodey.

Either way it seems we'll have to wait for the Champions or Young Avengers to find out.

Anyways if somebody wants to provide a counter argument as to why we should be upset about this possible whitewashing I'm all ears (or I guess eyes in this case)."	0	14

One of the main western wold epidemics is obesity. In my opinion we should introduce obesity tax and use this money to invest in climate change research and building eco friendly infrastructure.

Why do I think that? We already like to taxate things that are damaging nature. Obese people recuire more resources. Obese eat more food - you have to grow more food to feed them, thus increased resaurce consumption. If they eat more there is more waste - waste disposal is also resource intensive. Obese people wear bigger clothes food - bigger clothes means more material. Transportation of heavier objects is more recource intensive - you need bigger cars and you need more fuel because vehicle is more loaded. Obese people tend to to be ill more - you have to produce more medicine, you have to use more often diagnostics (CT, MRI etc) and to do that you need resources and so on...

As I said before - we could introduce this tax and use this money to a good cause - developing of eco friendly materials, infrastructure, energy source. 

The main problem that I see is more political - human rights and discrimination. 
So, lets' discuss.

Whilst your manager may accept suggestions and advice regarding solving a problem, they generally have the final say on which solution to try and are responsible if it 'fails' based on a defined or inherent criteria. The same can be applied to movements up the hierarchy,  certain levels can accept suggestions for specific promotions but again the managers make the call on whether or not someone is promoted. Wouldn't a more democratic approach be that everyone votes for who is promoted? I understand the complications regarding voting for every micro-decision but surely on some level, 'macro' decisions that affect further micro decisions would have to be agreed upon via consensus.

By contrast, **entrepreneurial debt** should be encouraged instead. I use this term to refer to the act of borrowing money, in exchange of interest or equity shares, with the goal of building a company or starting an activity that will yield utility in the long term.

**Why I believe consumer debt is bad**

When you borrow 100 dollars today from a bank, you are not actually borrowing from the bank. You are borrowing from the future version of yourself.

If you need to repay those 100 dollars after 1 year, yourself from 1 year later will have his wealth reduced by 100 dollars because he has to repay the debt you've made in the present. This alone forces him to rethink his lifestyle and tailor it to a smaller wealth, but it's actually worse because future you has to pay interest on the sum. This makes him even poorer.

So, if you generate debt today to purchase a 1000 dollars television, future you will have a television and 1000 dollars less in his pockets. 

I'll stop now and ask you to watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0) 30 minutes video from Ray Dalio, as it sheds more light on the subject.

If you don't feel like watching it, the gist is that if millions of people buy the television with debt they need to repay 1 year later, 1 year later we will have millions of people whose spending power has been reduced by 1000 dollars. This causes the world economy to take a substantial hit, especially when you consider that people generate debt for all sorts of useless things: low paying college degrees, expensive cars and accessories, large apartments and so on.

It's a cycle. We make ourselves richer in the present by making ourselves poorer in the future. 

Banning debt alltoghether would be obviously dumb, because debt can be an amazing tool. If I generate debt today to get a college degree that allows me to get a good paying job, I have made myself richer today by also making future me richer as well. If I generate debt to fund a business today, 1 year from now that business will generate even more money than what I originally borrowed.

**Conclusion:** I believe that, by banning consumer debt and encouraging entrepreneurial debt, the world economy would be a lot more stable. It wouldn't solve all its issues of course, since new companies fail and college graduates don't always get a good career, but it would definetely mitigate them."	0	58

First, I'll establish that God does have infinite knowledge.

1. “Remember the former things, those of long ago; I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like me. I make known the end from the beginning, from ancient times, what is still to come. I say: My purpose will stand, and I will do all that I please” ([Isaiah 46:9-10](https://ebible.com/query?utf=8%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Isaiah%2046%3A9-10&amp;translation=ESV&amp;redirect_iframe=https://www.AllAboutGOD.com/bible.htm)). 
2. “O LORD, you have searched me and you know me. You know when I sit and when I rise; you perceive my thoughts from afar. You discern my going out and my lying down; you are familiar with all my ways” ([Psalm 139:1-3](https://ebible.com/query?utf=8%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Psalm%20139%3A1-3&amp;translation=ESV&amp;redirect_iframe=https://www.AllAboutGOD.com/bible.htm)). 
3. Great is our Lord, and mighty in power; his understanding is infinite ([Psalm 147:5](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/psalms/147/5/s_625005)).

Anyways, I think you get it.  It's mentioned throughout the Old and New Testament. This means God knows all that has been and will be. 

Given that he knows the outcome of every ""choice"" or ""decision"" with 100% certainty, how can you say we have the ""choice"" to do something else?

If we have an apple and a pear, and I have to choose one, God already knows ill choose the apple. Therefore, I can't choose the pear because God has already seen me choosing the apple.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, please change my view, it's very demoralizing. Sorry If I didn't explain it very well, there's a lot of people who share my view so you can probably find it better explained online. Thanks!"	8	71

Currently, some judges have been using algorithms created by 3rd party companies that show criminals “risk level” of committing future crimes to help determine the proper sentence. However, there is little transparency about how these algorithms are made and their potential bias against certain groups. No one gets the see the full algorithm except the company who created it, not even the judge. While I’m not accusing any company of being intentionally biased, these algorithms have the power to exaggerate the current racial bias in the court system. If the full algorithm can be reviewed and be proven not to be unbiased, it would be a lot fairer compared to now, where the lack of transparency is potentially biased against minorities.	25	21

You can add to all of this, the fact that men do not have the remnants of chivalry to help them change a tire, hold a door, pull out a chair etc. I would have some respect for feminists if their efforts were focused on countries where women are still being attacked for trying to get an education, or having acid thrown in their faces for not covering up.

This makes no sense as they are literally speech.  It is also a call to action.  We have just agreed that calls to action can be an exception on our freedom of speech.  But people will insist that this is not speech which makes no sense.

This stance is quite unpopular (shoutout to R/UnpopularOpinion), but if you truly look at what he’s saying, and what racist rhetoric and ideologies are, he isn’t one. He grew up into a very wealthy family, and it’s safe to assume that he lived a life where he wouldn’t be able to understand the struggles that people less fortunate than him might have gone through. (Especially POC and other minorities who face a lot of discrimination) Though, I still believe that calling him a racist and comparing his shitty tweets to white supremacist rhetoric is not only wrong, but it’s also dangerous. If you keep calling Trump Hitler, you’re essentially downplaying the horrible atrocities committed by actual Nazis, and people who actually hold these views today (I.e Richard Spencer). I don’t believe that his lack of communication skills and idiotic comments that offend people aren’t equivalent to calls of lynchings, and gassing of millions of innocent people. I don’t consider myself a Trump supporter, but I think the MSM, and certain Left-Wing extremist take things much too far.

But here I’m talking about 5e, so we aren’t selling our soul for power anymore here. Honestly, I think the hate on necromancy is a bit undeserved, and may just be related to our fear of death. So here’s my rundown of why I think that necromancy isn’t evil, but is more like a chaotic neutral.

1. The main argument against necromancy is that the gods say it’s evil. But that’s not all true; only a few say it’s evil. Heck, not even all the “good” gods say it’s evil and are more just like “yeah, it exists”. And then there’s the Platonic argument that since all the gods are equally powerful, they naturally should all have equal say in morality. Since they disagree over what is right or wrong, they clearly shouldn’t be our waypoint of accuracy for our morals.

2. Second most common argument is that it enslaves the soul when you make a zombie or skeleton. This is very, very inaccurate, as some ghosts use their body as a weapon with Animate Dead. Only soul-based magic can do that to a person, and THAT is evil magic.

3. Necromancy isn’t the only class of magic to have evil spells, and is arguably one of the less nefarious spell types. Conjuration, when used to conjure a demon, requires human sacrifice. Blood magic requires literally using the blood of your enemies. Illusion and enchantment are used to make people go crazy (or worse). Compared to these rather terrifying displays, necromancy’s Soul Bind is a bit less nefarious. Liches kind of suck, but thats a more advanced version of soul binding, using your own soul. 

4. If people weren’t scared of it, villains wouldn’t gravitate towards it like children to the candy aisle at Walmart. It isn’t the strongest form of magic, and it certainly it isn’t the most terrifying in its potential (see point 3). They just use it because people are scared of zombies. If it were more accepted, it might be used somewhat, but it would probably be used just for some grunts or cannon fodder in front of the actual threats from the conjuration/evocation spells. 

In my honest opinion, I think Enchantment is an evil school. It has a couple friendly spells, but mostly it’s used to hypnotize the enemy into attacking their own friends. That seems a lot more evil than desecrating a body that isn’t useful to anyone anymore.

So, anyone disagree? Anyone have new ideas that counter my arguments? If so, feel free to try and change my view.

Edit: thanks to the guy who reminded me of this. Healing spells are necromancy. They’re definitely not evil."	36	68

So who the fuck made the universe? How did we come to be?

Atheists: science hasn't come that far yet but there's certainly no god

Now to me this is as stupid as religion. I feel like the ONLY defensible position is agnosticism (no clue if there's a god or not).

I know I know, you can't prove a negative. Fine. But it's a natural assumption to make that someone could have made the universe. Mainly because something (usually) doesn't pop out from nothing, like modern science seems to suggest.

EDIT:

My mind has been changed. Here's a little explanation why. I initially thought that something had to make the universe because I don't see how time can just begin from nothing. But then, who made that something? And who made the entity that made that something? It's a never ending loop and the only way to resolve it is by saying that the universe started from nothing. Which still doesn't make sense to me BUT it makes more sense than saying that we came from a god. I now believe that atheists are more logical than religious people.

Every situation is different for anyone who experiences it. I've unfortunately lost a couple of people in my circle to suicide, have had people come to me for help when they are flirting with the idea, and haven even flirted with those thoughts myself many moons ago.

If there is one common thing I've seen in my experiences, it's that those who are hell bent sure on the idea of doing it definitely have a distorted perspective on how they view the world around them, and how they fit within it. It could be (but not limited to) that they feel like nobody cares, that they have no value to contribute to society, or that society in general just has nothing to offer them in return for their own contributions. In almost all cases in which I hear of someone actually going through with it, it seems like nobody around them even saw signs. I take this to be because they are so cemented into their ideas and plans that they are careful to not open any lane for such a conversation to start as they see it to be worthless and a waste of time. 

In my opinion, someone who is not allowing any form of counter-argument to occur is likely struggling to come to grips with the possibility that their views and ideas might be wrong. I tend to question the effectiveness of someone continuously reinforcing the idea to a suicidal person they are ""mentally strong"" enough to get through it, and that they are overall ""wiser"" or ""worth more"" than the average person to not be around for family and loved ones to learn from. Would this not give a false sense of confirmation that they are mentally sound enough to feel like they are right in their views? Couldn't this further hurt any chances of them being open to the idea that the line of logic they followed to get those suicidal thoughts is indeed wrong?"	7	8

The French peasants wanted a revolution because people up top were abusing them. 

Hitler was a jack ass, and his hate was unwarranted, but he thought that Jewish people were rich and thus he hated them.

\-Anonymity. You can be as anonymous as you'd like. Without giving someone your username or posting personal info in a comment, there is no way for someone to tie your account to you short of stalker level data collection and/or tracking

\-You can follow close friends/family and they can follow you 

\-You can post items such as pictures, updates, etc just to your account for your followers to see that don't wind up visible

\-There is an ad-free subscription 

\-The sheer amount of content available is ridiculous, and management of what content shows up in your feed is pretty straight forward 

\-Communities/groups/subs (whatever you want to call them) are generally sorted by the most popular for that group within a recent time period, preventing you from seeing old or unpopular content 

\-Searching through or sorting said groups or finding them to begin with is a breeze 

\-Private chat features 

\-Easy to search for and view content outside of your subscribed groups and friends

**Cons for my case:**

\-Need to ask everyone in your life for their handle

\-If you're a fan of NSFW content, extremely easy to followers to see how kinky you are (unless you sign out first)

Now, clearly, there are a lot of separate issues- discrimination, private prisons, unreasonable bail amounts, and lack of protection  from prison rape, but I want to discuss perhaps the biggest issue with our justice system. Its Punitive.

Punitive justice is the idea that we lock people up to punish them, or in other words, jail is supposedly “revenge"" for committing a crime. It’s the concept that because you did something bad to society, society will do something bad to you.

Its somewhat stupid.

This system fails to address the cause of crime- mental health, poverty, upbringing, , and abuse. (Obviously there are other reasons, but these are generally the most common).

Now, picture this, you’re poor, you don’t do well in school. You may be raised in an unstable household, perhaps without a father figure. You make some bad decisions, deal some drugs, or perhaps steal a car, or maybe you get in a street fight. Boom! 15 years.

15 years locked in a cell doing nothing. When those 15 years are over, what’s  changed. Your still poor, no social support network, chances are nobody is going  to hire you.  So what do you do, you make the same bad decision. Boom! Another 15 years.
Its no surprise that many inmates are repeat offenders.

“But this is how they repay their debt to society”

Ive always hated this saying. It implies that we somehow owe something to society. Do you believe that people born into these situations of poverty and instability owe something to society. Society needs to start paying its own debts before it can go around collecting.

“But it removes people from society""

Yep, until they are released. Then the cycle begins anew.

“But these people are bad. They deserve what they get""

Honestly, I can see why you may think like this. I mean, look at our media. We constantly see stories of good vs bad. The heroes kill that bad guys. The evil minions are offed without a second thought. It makes sense that people would apply the same logic in real life. But real life isnt so simplistic, and often times, criminals arent bad people, just individuals who make poor choices. And that can be fixed.

Which brings me to the conclusion.

A rehabilitative justice system Is inherently Superior
Imagine if rather than simply locking people up In jail cells for years wasting our money and time, we focused on Helping people Become productive members of society.

 Think of your average drug dealer. Well, obviously the career choice is a bad one. But the intelligence and financial know-how needed to actual do the task is rather large. So imagine if we Taught that drug dealer how to run say, a small business Now Obviously they have to want to put the effort into learning but surely 15 years is enough teach. 
I feel as if a justice system, which focuses on actually stopping people from committing more crimes is a  is far better than one which simply punishes. while, I understand that we have an innate desire to take Vengeance on people we feel have wronged us we must give up our “ Justice boner “ To actually fix the problems that plague our society"	39	45	
changemyview	t3_duls57	https://www.reddit.com//r/changemyview/comments/duls57/cmv_homosexuality_is_absolutely_a_sin/	2019-11-11 02:34:11	boyhero97	CMV: Homosexuality is absolutely a sin	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/duls57/cmv_homosexuality_is_absolutely_a_sin/	"Tl;dr The OT and Hebrew law is not relevant to Christians and there is only 1 verse that condemns it in the NT. This verse's authenticity has been called into question by many scholars. 

I am arguing that homosexuality is not a sin and sex between two people of the same sex MIGHT or MIGHT NOT be a sin. I also want to prelude this with I am not a biblical scholar, just someone who has done a lot of research. 

First off, there is no mention of homosexuality in the bible. Homosexuality is a sexual orientation, something that the people in Jesus's age had no concept of. Homosexuality was not even a word until 19th century psychoanalysts invented it. Therefore, the bible cannot say anything about a concept they did not have. Second, on to my argument that homosexuality may or may not be a sin. The first mention of sex between two men is made in Leviticus. Leviticus and almost all of the rules and laws in the OT are part of the Old Covenant and do not apply to the New Covenant made by Jesus's death. This is why we can eat shellfish, shave, and wear clothes made of two kinds of fabric. 

On to the second argument. Most of the bible verses in the NT that are used to argue against homosexual activity do not explicitly refer to homosexuality. 

The most debatable one is 1 Corinthians 6:9-11. Many bible translations equate the words μαλακός (malakós) and ἀρσενοκοίτης (arsenokoítēs) to refer to homosexuality. Malakós is directly translated to mean ""soft."" Many recent bible translate it to mean ""homosexuality"" and older versions like KJV translate it to mean ""effeminate."" There is simply put no way to know exactly what Paul even meant by soft or even effeminate as what is effeminate in one culture might not be in another. Some have supposed that Paul meant weakness of character or cowardice instead of effeminate but Paul gives no context to this list of immoral things. The word arsenokoítēs is a compound word that Paul invented that directly translates to ""Malebed."" Again he does not give any context and there really is no way to know what he meant as the word is not only not used anywhere else in the bible, but we cannot find the word in ANY ancient Greek texts. This is why again, bibles such as the KJV do not translate it to mean homosexual acts. Paul doesn't define this term and we can't ask him what he meant by it. 

There are many other verses that people try to infer as condemning homosexual acts but that's a homophobic culture making inferences about a 2000 year old text. The only explicit ban on gay sex is in Romans 1:26-27. There is a lot of debate over this verse. Many obviously believe that this is a valid text and that it is clear. However, there are several scholars who believe this is a non-Pauline interpolation added to the letter later. In other words, we're unsure that Paul wrote it. Another very small minority argues that we should not listen to Paul on this issue because they believe that he is prejudice because of his Jewish background. I don't know how I feel about this last argument personally, but to be fair, Paul is the only person in the NT to talk about homosexuality. Why would NONE of the other disciples or Jesus talk about it if it was an issue? It was certainly going on. The Greeks were notorious for pedophilia, with it being acceptable for teachers to have homosexual relations with their students and the Romans, who ruled Jerusalem, were also very notorious for pedophilia and homosexuality so long as the male penetrating was of a higher social class. 

In conclusion. I am not saying that homosexuality is condoned by the bible, but it is not necessarily a sin. It is forbidden in the OT (unless there are similar translation errors) and I think it is safe to say that the Jews treated it as forbidden. But the New Testament is less clear. There are no verses that forbid it except for 1 verse, and that verse's authenticity is called into question by many scholars, as are a lot of Paul's letters and works."	0	55

This got me thinking about why people are so offended about weddings that take place on plantations. Despite reading several articles and comments decrying these weddings, I still don’t understand the offense. 

Yes, atrocities took place on plantations. Atrocities also took/take place at other locations that are considered acceptable as wedding locations - anywhere where Native American land was forcibly stolen or where their tribes were intentionally wiped out, anywhere where a war battle had once taken place, anywhere that was once segregated, anywhere that was once built by, housed or otherwise used enslaved people, anywhere where people have been raped, etc. Slaves built the White House and many universities buildings, farms and other buildings that are currently used for celebrations and weddings with no objection. Why are plantations singled out? If American people refused to have a wedding anywhere where atrocities once happened, they’d basically be limited to fairly new construction in areas Native Americans have never lived - I mean, what would even be left? Foreign venues in a country where there have never been slaves or war?

Also not all plantations used enslaved people and not all of them used a lot of enslaved people. For example, a large manor in the South could’ve had 15 enslaved people and a plantation could’ve had 5 enslaved people and used paid labor for the rest. Obviously neither have enslaved people today and haven’t for many years. Yet the manor can be promoted as a wedding venue today without offense and the plantation can’t just because one is a farm and the other isn’t? I think that’s unfair.

Do we decry all buildings for their racist or sexist pasts? Should none of us ever get married in churches, temples and other religious buildings that once refused to  condone interracial or LGBTQ marriages or segregation or used enslaved people’s labor or services (essentially ruling out any historic religious building), even if they’ve changed their tunes now?

Plantations today are still working farms with  features such as historical tours, wine-tasting, pick your owl fruits and veggies, haunted hay rides, live music, etc. Clearly they’re very different than how they used to be generations ago. If the current owners acknowledge the previous owners/their ancestors’ use of slave labor somewhere (e.g., historical exhibit at the plantation, pamphlets, description of history on its website), I don’t see why people shouldn’t use it as a wedding venue without a sense of shame. 

Overall, who knows what other venues once used slave labor? Basically any building built before 1865 would be disallowed (as well as any buildings currently built on former Native American land), and I don’t think people should be prevented from having weddings basically anywhere in America without being called insensitive - because that’s what the result would be. Also we’d have to build a new White House, Capitol, Smithsonian Institute, Wall Street, Faneuil Hall, Harvard University, Georgetown University, University of Virginia, Monticello, Great Pyramid, Great Wall...where does it end?

I believe that layering multiple blankets until you're as warm as you would be with a comforter is the superior sleeping configuration. My viewpoints are as follows:

- When layering multiple blankets, you have the option of removing some in the event of becoming too warm, giving you greater thermal flexibility than a comforter. To achieve a similar level of warmth control with a comforter, it is necessary to stick a limb out from under the covers, drastically increasing your chance of a demon gnawing on your toes.

- Individual blankets from a layered pile can be folded in half and placed on your feet or any other cold location for targeted insulation. Comforters can't really do this unless you get an oversized one, and even then you're stuck trying to fold the edge over itself without opening up an air gap underneath.

- Individual blankets are much easier to wash than a full-sized thick comforter, which sometimes requires a visit to a laundromat to use a sufficiently-heavy-duty washing machine to clean it properly."	30	17

As Christmas is coming I decided to post some of my doubts concerning Christianity, or maybe rather Catholic priests. Sorry for any mistakes. I am not a native speaker.

Priests are considered to be spiritual guides but I often have a feeling that they do not care at all and that all of it is just a farce. They do very little. They don't clean, don't cook, don't work and judge other people, for example, if it is wrong or not if somebody doesn't go to church because they are dead tired or tell them that the only sickness that justifies your absence during a Sunday mass is the fever of 42C.

Priests tell us how to live in romantic relationships but they don't have any experience of them. One priest told my friend that if she loved her husband she wouldn't be angry at him when he comes home totally drunk after partying and she just should keep quiet and give him dinner and if she yells at him for being drunk it is the lack of love on her side. The same priest told me that if I go to my neighbour at night to tell him to stop listening to music so loud because it's 2AM and I can't sleep it's the lack of love on my side. According to him, real Christians should just keep quiet about everything because meekness is love and goodness.

On one Sunday I attended a sermon during which the priest said that a good parent wants for their son a good job, and for their daughter a good husband. It sounded as if the only thing you would want for a girl is marriage. I'm 24 and currently single and every time I talk to a priest the only question he asks me is when is marriage going to happen and that I should actively look for a boyfriend. Then he proceeds to tell me that he has a niece who is younger than me and she has just gotten married as if he wanted me to feel guilty that I am not. I lead an active life in other ways but I am never asked about those other aspects of life as if the only thing in me that could potentially have any worth is whether I am in a relationship or not.

In my town there's a christian speed-dating event. What I find peculiar about it is that the oldest for men to come is 42 and the oldest for women is 39. Why is that? Non-christian speed-dating events don't have such limitiations. Why do women have to feel unequal from the very beginning?

Priests seem to have no idea how vicious, envious and cunning people can be. They seem to think that if you drink a cup of tea with somebody you instantly become friends and deeply care about each other's lives. During one sermon I attended, the priest said that an old woman came to him saying that nobody visits her and that she's very lonely and depressed. He told her that she had definitely worked for it because there is no other way you can become like this.

My whole family is Christian and when I tell them what I've just written, they tell me about those priests who were very brave and about whom you can read in history textbooks. Ok. But what about the rest of them? What about those I have just written about or about those who burn Harry Potter books as if they were the most evil thing in the world which is, and always has been, so complicated and messed up that no words can expess it.

That's the end of my rant. Can you change my view?"	0	7

Memory and learned behavior (conditioning) may mediate your responses to environmental stimuli to a degree but the older these are the less they impact you. (People seem to believe the opposite, that your earliest memories and conditionings effect you the most). There are two things that back me up here: more recent memories are stronger (and many childhood memories are completely forgotten) and time causes the extinction of conditioning. 

I think of this every time someone claims that they have bad social skills or something because they were bullied in school or were homeschooled. The truth is that social skills are mostly genetic and memory based."	0	59

If you have a giant on your team that's essentially your best asset. You don't want it biting the dust on the front lines when it's your best asset. Game of Thrones didn't use their Giants to a great effect in the TV series. Yeah it had a rather large bowl equipped but it seemed as if the humans did more work than the Giants.

Let's talk about Rocks.

First of all rocks are everywhere. You can find plenty of them on the battlefield next to you. If you can prep before a battle I was always tell the giant to find a bunch of rocks. Think about it. Imagine a Giants tossing ten pound boulders at you at like 70 mph. That's insane!. You would literally blow through any defense the enemy has. Not to mention the fact the sheer crazy of damage you would make would make enemies run and retreat.

Most Democratic candidates are advocates of some form of tuition deduction, whether that is through student loan forgiveness, pressure on universities to cut their budget, or more grants to students. This seems counterproductive to me, because the United States would like to have more young people in the trades, not less; less young people in college, not more. 

An additional, related point that I've heard candidate Andrew Yang discuss many times is that ""College got 2 1/2 times more expensive. Did it get 2 1/2 times better?"" He assumes the answer to be no, but I'd argue it to be yes. 

The value of a college degree compared to a highschool diploma has gone way up in the United States; back in the boomer era a middle-class life could be attained with a highschool diploma. This is far less likely to be the case now; what kind of job can one get with just a highschool diploma? So, although the value of a college degree may not have been 2 1/2 times better compared to back when Yang was in school, I would argue that the relative gain going to college has far exceeded that. 

I'm open to changing my mind, but not based on arguments such as education being a right. Food is also a right (and a more important one at that), but that doesn't mean truffles should be free."	0	38

The poll linked here convinved me that this is indeed the case, but why?

What Muslims Want:” A survey of British Muslims by ICM on behalf of Policy Exchange. London: Policy Exchange, Dec. 2, 2016.  
____

In my research I discovered this article by a professor named Graeme MacQueen, but he seems sort of anti-Semitic to me.


A recent poll reveals that a maximum of 4% of British Muslims believe the official narrative of the 9/11 attacks. This is one of the strongest rejections of that story ever recorded. The sponsors of the poll have done their best to link these poll results to extremism and terrorism, but the data offer no support for this interpretation. 

The poll was released as both a set of data and an interpretative report on December 2, 2016. The sponsor of the poll was British think tank, Policy Exchange, which had the polling company ICM carry out the survey. Policy Exchange, regarded as a highly influential institution, is known for its relationship to the Conservative Party. The current Chair of its Board of Trustees is well known neo-conservative, David Frum. Policy Exchange has been described by a representative of the Muslim Council of Britain as an “anti-Muslim organization,” a useful observation for readers puzzled by the think tank’s interpretation of the poll.

That being said, it seems reasonable to conclude that this poll is true based on the data alone. It also could simply be blowback, considerng the dramatic increase in islamaphobia since 9/11, which produced a sense of distrust.


The question in the poll that most directly addresses the events of September 11, 2001 is: 

&gt;“Who do you think was responsible for 9/11?” Five possible responses are listed, with results as follows (Report, p. 75; data set, p. 802):

Al-Qaeda/Muslim terrorists 	4%

Jews 	7%

The American Government 	31%

Other 	6%

Don’t know 	52%

 _____

Graeme MacQueen, however, writes:

&gt;In 2011 the Pew Research Group surveyed eight Muslim populations. Of the total Muslim population represented (588.2 million in 2011), 17% assigned guilt to Arabs (see endnote 2).

&gt;In short, a very modest percentage of Muslims around the world has accepted the official story. Knowing this makes the recent results for British Muslims look less peculiar. It is true, however, that these recent results show an even greater scepticism than usual among Muslims, and this is fascinating given the location of this Muslim population in the midst of a country where both government and mainstream media routinely recite the official story.

(Report, p. 76; data set, final page):

Al-Qaeda/Muslim terrorists 	71%

Jews 	1%

The American Government 	10%

Other 	2%

Don’t know 	16%
_____

MacQueen continues:

&gt;The contrast between 71% and 4% fingering “Al-Qaeda/Muslim terrorists” is, indeed, dramatic. But what Policy Exchange does not tell us is that, if British Muslims are not representative of world opinion, neither is this control group.

But the control group is not suppose to represent world opinion, just as Bristish Muslims does not represent world opinion of all muslims. 

MacQueen continues:

&gt;Anti-Semitism

&gt;The authors of the poll report say that some Muslim respondents, within the focus groups held in various locations in the UK, repeated the erroneous claim that no Jews died in the Twin Towers. The authors comment that this is an example of a “belief in conspiracies rooted in anti-Semitic tropes” and they explain that this claim is meant to be a sign that Jews “had foreknowledge of the attack–and were therefore implicated in the crime” (Report, p. 77)

&gt;The attempt to criminalize 9/11 dissent, in the UK and elsewhere, has depended in large part on the idea that everyone who questions the official narrative of 9/11 says “the Jews did it.” This allows 9/11 dissent to be regarded as a form of anti-Semitism and attacked by states with all relevant legal apparatus. The notion that 9/11 dissenters are racists plays into the criminalization effort much better, for example, than the notion that 9/11 dissenters are troubled by violations of the laws of physics in the official narrative.

&gt;The authors are correct when they say that the claim that no Jews died in the Towers is false. But they do not attempt to quantify this result. How many Muslims referred to this claim? In the only relevant part of the survey that is quantified respondents chose the US government as responsible for the attacks far more often than they chose “Jews.”

&gt;And what, precisely, does “Jews” mean in this poll? This option is one of five offered to respondents. Muslims did not choose the wording of this option: the designers of the poll did. To whom is the term pointing? The state of Israel? A group of high-ranking neo-conservative state officials in the US? Jewish teenagers in Montreal? We are not told.

and to top it off MacQueen, being the anti-Semite he is states:

&gt;[3] Examples of Israeli foreknowledge are referenced on pp. 151-153 of my book, The 2001 Anthrax Deception: The Case for a Domestic Conspiracy (Clarity Press, 2014). Another well-known example is the warning received two hours in advance of the attacks by employees of the Israeli instant messaging company, Odigo. See “Odigo says workers were warned of attack,” Haaretz, Sept. 26, 2001; “Odigo clarifies attack messages,” Haaretz, Sept. 28, 2001; “Instant messages to Israel warned of WTC attack,” Washington Post, Sept. 27, 2001; “Agents following suspects’ lengthy electronic trail–web of connections used to plan attack,” Washington Post, Oct. 4, 2001.

Are you kidding me, Israelis were warned about 9/11. No, they were not."	10	26

Sex is the body you are born in, gender is what you identify as.

According to this I believe there is nothing wrong with a person who has a penis ,was assigned male at birth, who identifies as a man and uses masculine pronouns identifying as trans. Your body has nothing to do with the way you identify, so what is stopping said person from identifying as transgender?

The definition of transgender I am using is “ denoting or relating to a person whose sense of personal identity and gender does not correspond with their birth sex.”

As far as I am concerned, If the man described above identifies as a trans man, that does not correspond with their birth sex of just man."	0	56

Less than 3 months ago, I started reading and joining subs of interest to me. I quickly learned there's a tremendous amount of toxicity in certain subs. I don't need to call any particular one out. I'm sure you can name a few from your own experience. 

My view is that with comments getting downvoted, and as a consequence muting the person for 6 minutes at a time, they aren't allowed to properly defend their view or statement, and basically are forced to suffer a gang attack. 

Therefore, that person will not go into a sub that he knows will differ with him on POV, and instead, is almost forced to only engage in discussions with others who are like minded. Rather than be a place of open discussion and fair interchange of competing opinions, Reddit (and many other areas of the internet) becomes a breeding ground for radicalism. 

There is no safe space to present an opposing idea without getting beaten up for it. 

Am I wrong for seeing it this way?"	112	55

While, on a very microscopic level this might be true, its absurd to suggest this as a reason for actually purchasing a bidet. 


1.)Wipes are cleaner than both alternatives. Bidet water isn't soapy. Its just water. If washing your hands with water and no soap isn't good enough, then washing your anus without soap isn't good enough either. Which means that as a matter of consequence, if you're not going to do what's needed to clean your anus, then saying that something is cleaner is 100% meaningless. Either use wipes (actually cleaner) or don't celebrate your bidet.

2.)If you have to wash your hands after using the restroom anyway, your hands are equally clean in both scenarios. 

3.)If your anus is clean enough with toilet paper that it's not staining your underwear, then the material aspect of this cleanliness is sufficient for 99% of applications. Especially because *you have to wash your ass anyway even if using a bidet.* If your participating in specific forms of sexual activity, a bidet isn't better you still have to wash your ass. 

There isn't a scenario where a bidet is better than TP except this imaginary cleanliness that comes from a sense of superiority that results from owning a bidet. They are functionally identical. You still have to wash which means the distinction is meaningless.  As I have stated multiple times, I fully accept wet wipes are cleaner because they have soap in them."	1	90

Now this statement applies to everyone in regards to whomever you vote for, but in this instance I’m going to be talking about Bernie Sanders supporters.

As more and more of the establishment throws itself behind Biden, I hear more and more rhetoric about how regardless of who wins the primary we all should come together to support the party nominee.

Some people are very militant about this, and will blame their parties loss on voters who don’t turn out to throw their support behind the majority candidate. I’ve listened to this for 4 years as someone who didn’t vote in 2016, as if the reason Hillary lost was because me and these millions of other voters didn’t do our duty and go support her, and not the fact that her character and her policies didn’t appeal to me and millions of others.

I see the same sort of situation emerging in 2020 if Biden loses to Trump. I’ll hear a lot of rhetoric to the tune of, “If you didn’t vote you can’t complain,” and “The reason Trump is president is because of people like you.”

Politics shouldn’t be a zero sum game, and the fact we have only two parties basically turns our elections into a form of sports, where people are expected to support a team and a color, even if, or especially if your team’s policies don’t resonate with you.

I think there are more than enough reasons that I won’t vote for Joe Biden even if he gets the nomination as seems likely. Whether it’s my concerns for his mental health, my concerns about his touchiness, particularly with children, my concerns with his voting record particularly with things like the Iraq war, or Gay marriage, or my concerns with certain racial things he’s said.

Personall I feel as though I have enough reasons to conscientiously object to voting for Biden. Yet without a doubt someone will insinuate that I should plug my nose and go vote regardless of whether I find a candidate and his policies distasteful or not.

Imo it’s not my responsibility to vote just to push someone out of office. Instead, it’s my responsibility to vote for someone I feel represents myself."	54	86

To me this seems backwards. If you don’t bring value to the consumer then over the long term your shareholders will lose value. Companies that mainly focus on short term profit margins by using tactics like misleading advertising and price gouging might show a temporary large profit margin, and a subsequent increase in their stock price, but this will not be sustainable over the long term. If the company focuses on bringing value to the consumer through honesty, integrity and providing a solid product value they will be sustainable. They might not see sharp up ticks in their stock values but will see a steady improvement over time.	2	53

It does not matter who she is if he wants to fuck. The woman has no control over being seen that way. 

People often say ''sex sells'' to justify using women in advertisement, but this statement is wrong. The truth is, ''women's bodies sells''. Because it's so easy to deshumanize a woman.

If a 12 years old girl happens to have curves, men will look at her because they can't help it. Even if they know she is a child. Because male sexuality doesn't care about that.

The sexual instinct of a man is to view a woman as a way to have sex. Using her. She could be replaced with another equally good looking woman. The sexual instinct of most men is to dominate that woman. 

Therefore, male sexuality is inherently evil. Even if men can be good people, they do not have control over the way they view women sexually. And we're all powerless to it, both men and women."	0	92

It occured to me when i was at a get together and a non-binary person was there(I didn’t know what it was then), so i said oh good for her, and my friend said no, call her them/they. I was taken aback but still tried and every time it felt so wrong, like she was put on some pedastoæ, so i just started saying her instead.

I would be cool if you could change my mind.

As people don't starve and are able to enjoy the perks of electricity and other amenities they are also much more likely to develop cognitive functions.

Intelligence also means that people become less violent (as they fear death) and much less likely to just put their lives and the fate of the human community they belong in the hands of few individuals.

This represent a risk, as centralization of command is always a bad strategy in pretty much every human activity ranging from war to fishing and hunting to farming and breeding. Thus centralization produces inefficiencies and possible output drops.

Some degree of centralization is needed for practicality, but as standards of living , cognition and HDI improve, people are far less likely to assign to some individuals the role of managers of the community without a constant oversight AND the ability to remove them in the event of them being ""incompetent managers of the community resources"" or straight up enriching themselves by subtracting resources from the community.


#The answer to the Western world development lies not in democracy but in abundant availibility of both biological energy (calories from an abundancy of arable land to support cognition and population growth) AND chemical energy (coal, gas...to support technological advances and electricity production) .

Obviously, if a baby has two parents who identify as race X, then it's highly likely that the baby will also grow up to identify as a person of race X and consider themselves to be a part of the X racial community. This, I accept. However, this is also true for religious and political affiliation as well. An atheist couple is likely to have kids that grow up to become atheists, a Democrat couple is likely to have kids that grow up to become Democrats, and so on. Yet we don't refer to the babies of atheists or Democrats as being ""atheist babies"" or ""Democrat babies"".

A baby doesn't know what atheism is so he/she cannot be considered a member of the atheist community. A baby doesn't know what the Democratic party stands for so he/she cannot be considered a member of the Democratic party. A baby doesn't know what ""black"", ""white"", or ""mixed-race"" means in the context of American society so he/she cannot be considered a member of these communities. To claim that a baby is black or white or mixed-race before he/she can exercise a claim to such membership is dishonest and is not reflective of the baby's own state of mind.

Finally, there are cases like Barack Obama who would have been classified as a mixed-race baby at birth due to having a white-identifying mother and a black-identifying father, but eventually chose to identify primarily with his black father's side instead (in fact, when asked about race in his census form, he stated that he ticked the ""black"" check box and left the ""white"" check box blank). Obama chose to identify as a black man in adulthood, and he did so despite the knowledge that black people are often disadvantaged and suffer from discrimination in American society. Was baby Obama mixed-race and adult Obama black? Did his race change once he was no longer a baby? Or is it more likely that baby Obama knew little and cared little for the concept of race and was in fact, *raceless* and it wasn't until after his experiences of childhood, adolescence, and adulthood shaped him in such a way that he was able to find a closer sense of belonging in America's black community?"	0	25

Same for any third party voter. If you choose to vote for a third party, you are voting for an ideal, rather than the two actual choices you have.

I don’t think he was giving great arguments as he was getting pretty heated, so I thought I’d throw this post up in hopes for more rational arguments. Thanks for reading and I look forward to your responses.

EDIT: These responses have been great. While I haven’t awarded any deltas, this is something that will take time in order for my mind to change, and it may. I have a better understanding for the arguments against my point of view and will continue to explore these arguments. If I end up changing my mind in the future, I will come back and award deltas.

The flexibility of democratic governance has also allowed it to be a system that can improve upon itself whenever a massive issue arises (monopolies, worker laws, etc.) Not to mention the competition allows much more growth and drives companies and workers to produce better products to help improve lives.

The one major contender I’ve found to capitalism is communism which has simply been exploited every single time it has been implemented, and most likely would continue despite previous failures.  If the world was a perfect place where everyone was exactly the same, then communism would be preferable.  But everyone is different and strives for different things and has different talents, which makes capitalism a better option to pursue productivity.

Although it is easy to admit that capitalism allows a lot of inequality, as well as worker exploitation and wealth hoarding in a lot of cases.  Needless to say, it helps improve more lives overall than any other economic system implemented yet.

It feels more like people want to enact angry punishment rather than fix something. It’s also such a far-fetched goal that I don’t think anyone really believes is actually an achievable outcome from the protests. Defunding the police force would probably end up costing more money in the end anyway.

In my opinion you want the police force to be well trained, mature, level-headed, smart people who are well paid (the pay rise in question would come post reform). The kind of people who just sigh when sworn at, not swing. You want their job to be an extremely competitive field with many applicants (meaning they’d be able to choose the absolute best and not just accept everyone who signs up) and their training programs to be lengthy and state-of-the-art, with expertly constructed mental evaluations. Paying your police force well also decreases low-level corruption.

Not only would doing this help but it’s also something politicians will be more interested in implementing because it is to everyone’s approval. Those people who think there’s nothing wrong the way things are now will not object to extra funding for the police, Trump would also be able to spin this as some victory for himself (which is the absolute only way he would ever sign off on something), the police force will obviously back a pay rise, and every american gets access to a better police force and thus a better and safer country. 

It just seems like an achievable win and accomplishes the exact thing we all want for you (a police force you can trust, rely on, be proud of), asking for total demolition sounds like a great way to have your government ignore you as they usually do (a problem in every country) and just wait until people stop protesting, and unfortunately the protests will have to end *eventually.*

We all have enhanced memory, data retention and information retrieval capabilities because it exists. If you have a smartphone in your pocket and an internet connection, you can express and consume information to a degree that is exponentially higher than it was at any point in our history. Other advancements (the printing press comes to mind) advanced us, but the internet is on another playing field.

Another consequence of this is the proliferation of interpretations of facts, the proliferation of false information, and the proliferation of interpretations of false information. In theory, this should overall be a good thing. In practice, it has caused division, polarization and the rejection of coherent evidence-based conclusions.

But it gets worse. If we assume that people generally want the truth and prefer being correct, why are so many of us pitted against each other on issues that should be self-evident to everyone? Climate change comes to mind, where a well-reasoned and well-researched view unmistakably points to man made climate change being the existential threat of our times. Are the people who can't accept this view stupid? Ignorant? Is that really the problem? Is it really unmistakable? 

It is my view that:

1. People generally want to be intellectually honest and upright
2. To do so requires investigating all claims and opinions on a topic with the same level of vigour before coming to a conclusion. It also involves revisiting all ideas with that same vigour when new claims are presented.
3. Next to nobody has the time to sufficiently research any single topic, let alone all of the ones that affect us day to day.
4. As a result, we lean heavily on our biases and end up necessarily blind to opposing views that may, in fact, have the data in their favour.
5. The only way to resolve this problem is to build a compendium as powerful as the internet that everyone can fully trust, that stays up to date, and presents all the narratives on all possible issues according to how confident we ought to be in them.
6. Were we to do this, our species would make real progress on all of the most important questions in science and philosophy and be able to focus our productive power on things that drive our culture forward.

To be clearer, my view is not that this is actually possible. I also do not believe that everyone would hold the same opinions if such a system existed, because the data is often ambiguous on difficult issues. If two interpretations had similar coherence and evidence behind them, I would expect there to be a concerted effort to prove one over the other.

Hopefully this was clear enough! I'm excited to hear your opinions."	3	24	0.64

If a group of people decide you have some social trait, you have an ugly hat for example, then that becomes ""the truth"" despite the fact that you may not agree. You have the ability to make your case to them and argue why you think your hat isn't ugly, but you can't decide it for them and as long as you're in that room with those people, the fact is you have an ugly hat. If you were to leave the room and go to a different room with different people who all decided that your hat is amazing, well then your hat is amazing. 

This concept I think applies as a whole in pretty much all social settings, but I admit it's a fairly bleak view which is why I want to hear opposing views and potentially come to see things differently. I suppose using the word truth and facts might not be the best word choice, but I'm not sure how else to explain the concept.

Or even that his rough treatment was racially motivated. Don't get me wrong, I am not saying the way the police treated him was correct or proper conduct. However, to insinuate that his unfortunate death is due to racism and not at all because of George Floyd's own actions is ignorant and disingenuous. The man was a career criminal. He was high on meth, phentynol, and had also robbed a pregnant woman at gunpoint. When he was arrested, instead of obeying and complying like a normal person, he behaved like a man on drugs (which he was) and tried to fight against the officers and run away. None of this would have happened if he had simply accepted his arrest like a normal person. 

People are dying and businesses are being destroyed in these protests for what? To honor a scum bag by all accounts, who may not have deserved to die, but pretty much caused his own demise. Regardless of skin color, if you behave the way George did when under arrest, you will be treated with force. Race had little if anything to do with his arrest.

It infuriates me that no one even talks about the innocent men and women killed in these riots such as Officer David Dorn who was killed im the line of duty, yet they are immortalizing a career criminal in the media.

George Floyd's Death is being used as a political tool to push an agenda and perpetuate the belief that most/all white cops are racist, when in fact the VAST MAJORITY are good cops.

EDIT: I want to clarify that IMO George Floyd's death was UNJUSTIFIED and the Officer involved definitely behaved inappropriately. I am simply fed up with the portrayal that George's death was entirely racially motivated and not at all caused at least in part by his own criminality.

EDIT 2: I agree that attacking George Floyd's character and giving the perception that I believe his death was justified due to this was a mistake and have changed my mind about this. The reason I brought up his character (or rather lack thereof), is because it annoys me that the media is portraying him as a saint and ignores all the innocent deaths caused by the protests. These innocent deaths IMO deserve far more attention and remembrance than the likes of George Floyd's."	2	124	0.52

Despite this, when studying WW2 the role of the Swiss in aiding the Nazi expansion, civilian bombing campaigns, and storing Nazi gold are never addressed. We simply learnt that Switzerland was neutral and that being neutral wasn't a bad thing. 
Let me define a few key ideas:


Facilitating war crimes: Making it easier to perform war crimes and aiding the actions (I am not saying they enacted war crimes, simply that they made it easier for the Nazis to do them)
Aiding the Nazis: It is evident that the Swiss aided the Nazi campaign (they traded weapons, stored Nazi wealth and allowed the Nazis to invade their airspace on multiple occasions)
War Crimes: Here I am specifically addressing the genocide committed by the Nazis in the holocaust alongside civilian bombings although other ideas are applicable.

Here it is evident that Nazi war crimes were aided by the actions of the Swiss. I know they didn't directly commit war crimes and there's no legal body to hold this kind of action accountable, but shouldn't we hold them up to some kind of ethical standard for these actions we condemn in society so much? This is a government we are talking about, why do we still believe it is acceptable for people to perform business with Nazis? Why is this not talked about or taught to our children? Is being a bystander to a genocidal regime an acceptable action?"	5	33	0.62

Like braiding your hair is suddenly offensive to Africans who 'had it first'.

I am British and i don't think i could care less if someone decided to use my culture in whatever way they want.

I don't get why we can't all use each others culture and embrace it together. If we truly wanted equality why are we attacking people who like bits of other cultures and want to use it themselves? 

More bullshit examples i have seen are:

Taking another country's food dish and adding your own twist to it. Eg when a white chef took a twist on pho, a Vietnamese dish, apparently appropriating their culture?!

Offence over music, if an artist uses different styles of voice or dancing that come from other cultures, is somehow wrong and offending to the culture. Or if a remix of a 'traditional song' is somehow also considered offensive.

When people use other cultures clothing/fashion, eg hennas, braids as i said before, and other accessories.

I just don't get why we can't all just appreciate other cultures and use them in our everyday life, without everyone assuming it is done to cause chaos and offence.

It goes without saying mocking another culture is too far and shit like that, but general use that has no means of wanting to be offensive is just stupid, idiotic and negatively impacts societies where there are many cultures."	170	112	0.8

I propose that an upper age limit for voters, like seventy years old, would be better for society.  I have two arguments for my position.  

1.  

Elderly voters are heavily incentivized to vote for people who will give them short-term benefits even if it costs more in the long-term.  For example, elderly voters find it easier to vote for people who will increase the national debt unsustainably because they will be dead by the time it would start to significantly affect them.  Younger voters have more time to live and thus are less incentivized to vote for people who will give them small benefits in the short-term in exchange for a huge cost over the long-term.

2.

Elderly voters are not as incentivized as younger voters to improve society as a whole.  Younger voters will eventually be elderly so they are incentivized to vote for policies that help elderly people.  Elderly voters will never become young again so they are not incentivized to vote for policies that help younger people.  For example, younger voters who want to own a home in the future will vote for policies that make home ownership more affordable for them as well as policies that help current homeowners.  Elderly homeowners by contrast have little incentive to vote for policies that make home ownership more affordable but are heavily incentivized to vote for policies that help current homeowners.

TL:DR

Elderly people are less incentivized than younger people to support policies that benefit society as a whole over the long-term."	0	118	0.44

I would argue that specifically for police and teachers, unions actually harm society. 

For example the US spends the most per student by a lot, with abysmal results compared to other countries. Unions exist to prevent the firing of bad teachers. If bad teachers could get fired, then we could actually get qualified individuals with a passion for teaching. But in order to do that the job has to be competitive with a competitive salary. For example, offer 100k base with bonuses for performance. Why on earth would any qualified person take a job that barely pays a living wage? Some teachers do it because they are passionate about it, but compensation is highly important for results. 

Now moving on to police. The argument is the same. Why should they get unions that serve to protect them from misconduct? We see it all the time, bad cops getting suspensions with pay or some other non-sense punishment. Get rid of the Union, get rid of bad cops , and put together an independent oversight committee.

What I'm sharing here in terms of its history is just based on what I know of the country. The gist of my argument is that there are deepening divisions across the US across ideological/political/social/cultural lines. Because of this, the USA is in fact *not* united at all. 

The American Revolution set out one of the most impotent political moments in the 18th C. It marks a turning point in the anti-colonial movements that succeed it. It marks the creation of a distinct state separate from the UK. In that respect, the USA was a giant political 'experiment' if you will as its founders set out to establish something that hat hitherto never been done before. 

The later Civil War became a turning point in this young county's history as Americans tried to find a way to unite despite very strong and opposing views on very important matters. As PBS describes it:

&gt; A common explanation is that the Civil War was fought over the moral issue of slavery.

&gt; In fact, it was the economics of slavery and political control of that system that was central to the conflict.

&gt; A key issue was states' rights.

&gt; The Southern states wanted to assert their authority over the federal government so they could abolish federal laws they didn't support, especially laws interfering with the South's right to keep slaves and take them wherever they wished.

In the end, the North prevailed and these individual states became part of a broader federal union that was called ""The United States of America."" 

The extent to which these individual states were united I'm sure has varied over time. However, it seems to me that today, the USA is more divided than at any other point in history. It seems obvious that there are important cultural, moral, political, economic, and social differences between southern and northern states. It's evident in the voting patterns historically across the country and in the social differences between them. 

I'd argue that the USA, which was  the product of very revolutionary ideas, is no longer living up to the idea of a group of united individual states located in America. 

Civilizations come and go. Rome is perhaps the best example of this. Is it too far afield to hypothesize that the USA could go down a similar path given the escalation division and lack of a united vision on what it means to be a state in today's modern world?

First off I'll start with the elephant in the room; Donald Trump. I will not be the first one to call Donald Trump a fascist, nor will I be the last. This CMV however is not about Trump, I mainly wish to discuss the **USA as a whole** instead of just this administration.

While some people might say these are all symptoms of the Trump Administration, I would argue that many of these problems were already present in pre-Trump USA.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Powerful and continuing expressions of nationalism

American nationalism is taught from young age trough for example [education](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/rules-about-how-to-address-us-flag-came-about-because-no-one-wanted-to-look-like-a-nazi-180960100/) and [sports](https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/military-football.jpeg).

2. Disdain for the importance of human rights

Human right voliatons in for example [Guantanamo bay](https://digitalcommons.law.seattleu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2279&amp;context=sulr).

3. Identification of enemies/scapegoats as a unifying cause

The nazi's racist policies were inspired by [American Jim Crow laws](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/30/how-american-racism-influenced-hitler).

4. The supremacy of the military/avid militarism

I think [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Military_Expenditures_2018_SIPRI.png) speaks for itself.

5. Rampant sexism

While the USA is on the [lower side](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/2019/10/peril-progress-prosperity-womens-well-being-around-the-world-feature/) compared to other western countries, this is not that bad.

6. A controlled mass media

While there definately exists free press in United States, the nation still ranks [very low](https://rsf.org/en/united-states) on the [Free Press Index](https://rsf.org/en/ranking_table).

7. Obsession with national security

We have a clear example in the [Patriot Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act). On the other hand the EU seems to still value [privacy](https://www.edaa.eu/a-legislative-comparison-us-vs-eu-on-data-privacy/). (Although still not enough IMO)

8. Religion and ruling elite tied together

American politics is [quite religious](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/07/16/8-facts-about-religion-and-government-in-the-united-states/). Though I guess coming from a county as [irreligious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religions_by_country) as the Netherlands any nations politics would seem religious.

9. Power of corporations protected

I honestly don't know enough about economic policy to comment on this. As far as I know however the USA is known for protecting big businesses. On the other hand the Netherlands are known for being an international tax haven, and Rutte has been criticized a lot recently for giving Shell and other big companies [tax cuts](https://br.reuters.com/article/us-netherlands-tax-idUSKBN1DF2HQ).

10. Power of labor suppressed or eliminated

The USA has a long [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestead_strike) of [anti-union](https://psmag.com/economics/what-caused-the-decline-of-unions-in-america) policies.

11. Disdain and suppression of intellectuals and the arts

I do not believe either the USA or western European countries are against intellectualism or the arts. While Donald Trump does disregard science this is not a movement unique to the USA.

12. Obsession with crime and punishment

American society values [punishment over rehabilitation](https://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug03/rehab).

13. Rampant cronyism and corruption

While the USA doesn't score very well in the [Corruption Perceptions Index](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2019/results/nld), it is still better than France and Spain for example.

14. Fraudulent elections

As far as I know votes in American elections are generally speaking being counted fairly.One could argue however that the system itself is fraudulent as because of [gerrymandering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering_in_the_United_States) people are not being represented like they should be.

&amp;#x200B;

These views are based on what I percieve American society values. I have never lived in the United States however, so these views might very well be wrong. That's why I challenge you to please change my mind!"	7	54	0.53

t ""the people should decide"" isn't really valid. ""The people"" (ignoring the fact that Trump lost the popular vote, but that's a separate
 topic), already decided Trump should have the decision on who's nominated when they voted him in 4 years ago and the people decided on 
the Senators who'd be doing the approval during their last election(s).

The argument that they shouldn't move forward was wrong 4 years ago when they held up Garland's confirmation, and it's wrong now.

The fact is the people in time limited positions should be performing the duties of those positions during their time. From the moment t
he president is sworn into office until the moment their term is up they are the president and have that authority and responsibility, s
ame with members of congress. If on the last day of their session, congress decided to declare war on Canada, they could do that (the ne
xt Congress could immediately end it, but that's not the point). 

There are practical issues related to the timelines, but that's not what I'm talking about. I'm only talking about the concept of ""the p
eople should decide""

Personally, I think the whole way the SC is run should be changed, I think the justices should be rotated in and out from pool of all Fe
deral judges, but that's also another topic."	120	163	0.76

My reasoning for this is pretty standard (people vote and not land, voters should be represented equally, etc) so I'm just gonna address some of the more basic counterarguments I've seen that I disagree with:

1. **Larger states would just stomp all over smaller states if they proportionately had the same amount of votes.** This one seems to be the most common one I see and also happens to be the one that makes the least sense to me. From a partisan standpoint, I agree that this would make sense if the combined population of Democratic states was significantly different than the proportion of Republican voters, but this is very much not the case.   
For example, in the 2016 election, the population of blue states was approximately 156 million and the population of red states was about 167 million, so why do any of the states need disproportionate representation? Sure, California might have 12% of the population, but so does Texas+Louisiana+Mississippi+Alabama. Should each person's vote in those southern states matter more just because they happen to be split up into separate states?   
I saw this analogy in another thread: *Democracy is two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.* and I take issue with this as applied to the US electoral system for two reasons:   
-the 2 wolves vs 1 sheep implies one of the parties being significantly larger than the other when this isn't really the case.        
-using a wolf and a sheep implies one of the parties is morally right and that the other is wrong   
  
2. **Popular Sovereignty is not always good, examples including things like Nazi Germany** True, I agree, but there's nothing you can really do about it. The law has no morals; it doesn't choose to give disproportionate representation only when the minority side is morally right. If a large group of people can collectively make a bad decision, a smaller group can do it even more so. We have a Bill of Rights for a reason, to protect against a tyrannical government.   
  
I'll wait for arguments to come in, but I think that my main point is just that the ""minority"" really is not a minority at all. Using statements like ""oh candidates could just win the election by campaigning in California and New York"" as a counter to a proportional electoral college just doesn't make sense to me when it can just be flipped around to become ""candidates could just win the election by campaigning in the South""- in the 2016 election, Trump still would have won even if the electoral votes were proportional to state population because California really isn't as populous as some people make it out to be."	9	68	0.61

There are truly 2 separate countries with completely opposing moral and political views housed in the US. Splitting into 2 wouldn't even be possible due to the entire middle of the country falling on one end of the spectrum, with the majority of each coast going to the other. I will try hard to not bias my post toward one side being in the right/wrong for the sake of discussion since that's not what this post is about. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is regardless of the outcome, we've seen that one half of the country completely despises the other half and visa versa. For one,  republicans and democrats have extremely different ideals and stances on policy. Middle of the aisle candidates don't even exist. If you aren't far right, you're a liberal in their eyes. It you aren't far left, you're a conservative in their eyes. If Biden wins, Trump has convinced his supporters that it was through cheating and that there was malarkey with the vote counting. If Trump gets vote counting stopped or tossed out as he's trying to do, his opponent's will argue that that is a complete attack on democracy. Neither side wants to work with the other at this point. Neither side will accept the outcome of this election despite any proven facts that could be presented by one or the other. This leads me to believe we are doomed to a repeating cycle from here on out. 

There appears to be no winning or coming back from this. America is deeply fractured and will be the end of itself from the inside, one way or the other over the coming years. Whether it's a civil war, complete inaction by parties refusing to work together, or the loss of democracy, it seems to be on a path to self-destruction.

World governments and the scientific community I believe need to re-evaluate the way they allow private entities such as businesses and academic institutions to capitalize on the access to information as well as the targeted distribution of information to the general public. If this problem is not well recognized and handled seriously I believe we could soon see many more people that are divided and at odds with facts and reality. 

Additionally, just to give a personal perspective (I have no cited source for this but) if i were a betting man I would say it’s likely that algorithms on platforms such as YouTube may have had more of an impact on political radicalization in recent years than we may like to think.

Note: I am willing to accept that this perspective can have its own issues when it comes to the potential for government overreach regarding interference in private and business affairs.

Note 2: if your thinking that my view implies that private actors who are mainly motivated by financial gains cannot be trusted to handle information ethically. You’re correct.

I live in Uruguay (Cavani's country of birth) and the word used in the post it's not even close to being racist. That word it's used really often as a common nickname and the fact that some people are calling him a racist its bizarre. If we can't understand the context of the sentence, how the hell are we going to move forward? 

Another example (this is an anecdote that probably doesn't represent reality, however it might be interesting to see if anybody had similar experiences).Two years ago, I was drinking a beer in a little town close to Norwich. I was with a friend who me and my friends call ""n*gro"", meaning ""black"" in spanish. I swear to God, a group of ladies came to me, one tap on my shoulder and said ""if I hear that word one more time I'm calling the owner of the place"". Since my explanation wasn't enough for her, I had to leave because I was somehow causing unnecessary tension in the place. 

So, I love all the efforts to make the world a place with no room for racism. I really think it's fantastic all the progress done. But, It makes me sick how sometimes we try to look for racism where there isn't shit. Maybe I'm not understanding the situation really well since I'm not american or european, but the fact that the post at the beginning had to be removed, and that Cavani and Manchester United had to publish an apology it's insane."	29	57	0.83

This will let them draft Trevor Lawrence who has generational level hype around him. On a season where they are already out of the playoff hunt and everyone knew going in that they weren't going to compete getting him is far more important that winning a couple meaningless games.

So what happened? They were leading the Raiders with about 15 seconds left. This means that the Raiders had 2 plays (if the first play is either an incomplete pass or the receiver is able to get out of bounds. Since the Raiders were still on about the 50 they had a long way to go and very little time to get there. So as a defense the coverage you virtually always go into is a variation of the ""Cover 4"" defense. where you only have 3 players trying to get at the QB and you have your remaining 8 guarding the sideline and deep ball. You want them to throw the ball into the middle of the field and you don't care how many yards they can pick up because they won't be able to stop the clock again before time runs out. At best with this defense the Raiders could pick up 10 yards slide and spike the ball to give them 1 last play. But this would still mean the endzone is 35-40 yards away.

What did the Jets do instead? They went with a cover 0 all out blitz. It means they rushed 7 with an 8th pointlessly being a spy guarding the short middle. And only had 3 players left playing coverage. This left an undrafted rookie to guard one of the fastest players in the NFL and predictably led to a game losing touchdown. Now if the play was successful and the Jets were able to sack the Raiders QB the game would be over but the play call was a completely high risk, low reward scenario that had no to reason to called.

Now the best argument that I have heard against this being a tank job call is that the Defensive Coordinator will be (and already has been) fired by the end of the year so it won't matter to him whether or not the team gets the #1 pick. My counter to that is that he still cares about the team and the players and wants to best for them even if he won't be around for it. And since we will never get the truth out of him this argument dies there. So I am looking for any other argument or justification on why that was a legitimate call and not a play designed to fail."	6	14	0.6

We know it's true because IIRC it was said in interviews that was the intent - to bring the Star Wars universe to a new generation. I agree that they could (and probably should) have done something different, though given the new characters, the great filmography and effects, and great new characters, I personally don't think it's that big of a deal though I respect that other people do.

Everything else is invalid.

""Rey can pilot too well!"" - Anakin build c-3po and a functioning pod racer which he raced AND WON at the age of 8.

""Rey can fight too well!"" - Rey didn't grow up on a farm - she was a scavenger who often had to protect herself and her haul. Not only can we intuit it fairly reasonably from circumstance, we can see from early on that she knows how to handler herself as she fights off some people trying to take BB8. Meanwhile, Luke was swining a lightsaber around blind-folded an hour after leaving Tatooine and we had zero reason to believe he had any fighting experience at all.

""Rey shouldn't have been able to fly so well!"" Pod. Racing. She didn't do anything out of the bounds of other jedi heroes-to-be. At least she's piloted before that scene - AFAIR little Anakin had never even moved the podracer before.

""Rey shouldn't have been able to force manipulate someone!"" - There's an entire scene where the somewhat unstable Kylo tries to force his way into her mind and she is able to push back. His lack of control and her natural ability accidentally trained her. Just as someone who has a sensei throw a punch a certain way and someone learns it from observation (or receiving), Rey was able to learn it well enough to handle one simple stormtrooper soon after.

""Rey shouldn't have beat Kylo!"" And she didn't. She fought as hard as she could against someone who was toying with her, trying to turn her, while also suffering a gut-wound from a bowcaster. In one moment at the end, he's obviously extremely winded and feeling weak and Rey gets a few good hits in. None of that is nearly as unbelievable as people have made it out to be. At this point we don't even know how good a saber-fighter Kylo is anyway. Only that he suffers major problems with control.

So I'll make this easy-mode. ""What it will  take to change my mind"" as people so often ask is simply a well-reasoned example of serious flaws in the movie compared to the level of skill/accomplishment set by other movies in the series.

EDIT: Ok, it seems that ""criticism was the wrong word to use"". I'm looking at examples where fans who know and understand the Star Wars movies think that this film is broken, invalid, wrong, out of character, or otherwise breaks the rules set by the other movies. Basically that it's ""unbelievable"". I would have though my examples would make that clear, but hopefully this helps. Obviously, you can't argue opinions so I should have needed to say that I wasn't trying to here."	0	72	0.45

That's a hell of a lot different than bending over a 5+ year old and whipping them on the ass though. Or like my mom, just grabbing whatever is in reach and going to town for even the most minor of infractions from ages 5-?? (It was still happening last I spoke to her 2-3 years ago)

Is there a better way that would avoid ANY physical component? Not sure if it's ok to do this but I won't accept any variation of the answer ""Watch them better."". I consider it infeasible to have a 100% uptime of observation on the child.

That's why men in general have the instincts to take more risks, work more, be more aggressive in pursuit of success in general as a result of natural selection. That's the reason why, given a large sample, men earn more or have a large presence in politics. For example look at Iran and Finland: you'd expect more women working in stem at Finland since women are more free there, yet it's the total opposite, because as women get more free they inclined to choose jobs that brings self-fulfillment, rather than a stressful job for earning more.

In fact, the only reason I care at all about it as a state is that it is politically important. Otherwise, I'd rather vacation somewhere else. Some players in my RPG have told me that Florida law prohibits people from killing alligators, since it isn't uncommon for them to creep out of the swamp and into your swimming pool. But I don't get it. Florida is one of those states that permits ""stand your ground"" laws, where in I can use lethal force against a home invader...but not an alligator. 

I personally think it's dumb that a human life is deemed less valuable than that of an alligator. Alligators aren't endangered down there, they are everywhere. Not that a conservative state like Florida even cares about the environment, but the point remains, alligator life before human life. If I saw a gator in my swimming pool, on my property, uninvited, I'd be the first person to take a shotgun and make me a nice new pair of boots. I don't care if Animal Control is capable of safely removing them, that's not the point. If I can defend my property with lethal force from a human, then I should be allowed to do so with an alligator. Yes, humans may be more malicious than an alligator, but both are violent predators when they want to be. And I doubt gators swim in pools to cool off."	0	68	0.48

I enjoy eating this way, and am not the sort to shame people for their dietary choices. 

The other day I realised that if everyone reduced their intake of animal products by 50%, it would have **the exact same impact** as 50% of the population going fully vegan. 

The idea of our culture as a whole shifting more towards high-quality meat, with an increase in grains/vegetables, seems far more plausible than half of all people *radically* shifting their entire diet and lifestyle. Everyone could still eat meat every day, we'd just be more mindful and appreciative of it. 

People have a totalitarian view of veganism, due to the 100% commitment that it demands as a result of its definition. As a result, the majority of people have absolutely no interest in entertaining it. 'Vegan' as a descriptor of a person -- something which you can either be or not be -- is detrimental to the cultural conversation around animal consumption.  It prospers a mindset of 'vegan food is for vegan people', instead of 'this is food made of vegetables'. 

It does not help that *some* vegans shame even vegetarians for their dietary choices, though I understand why they feel the need. 

If I was 'vegan' or 'plant-based' for 90% of my life, and consumed animal products at special occasions, or when an alternative was difficult to find, I'd still be doing a whole load of good. For this, I would be labelled a hypocrite and trend-hopper.  

**Conclusion**: '*Flexitarianism*' (another contentious descriptor) has more chance of improving animal conditions than veganism, due to the lack of radical change necessary to implement it across society."	15	26	0.78

The path to a functional government is not in getting rid of the filibuster but would be better achieved in ranked choice voting, which would yield candidates capable of compromise.	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/l6pqy7/cmv_the_filabuster_plays_an_important_role_in/	"The filibuster has a long and storied history (one that I am not expertly familiar with). But the current call to dispose of the filibuster, while making legislation possible again, would lead to pendulum swings in governance as different parties control congress. The reason the use (and abuse) of the filibuster has sky rocketed is because the current political environment is one that has vanishingly few moderates and so compromises and bi-partisanship means that the filibuster has only one real function at the moment: obstruction. 

If we want a functioning government, the problem is not the filibuster, it's the extremes of the parties. Yes, getting rid of the filibuster would clear the log-jam, as I mentioned above, but at a very big expense of creating these large pendulum swings I referenced. However, if we broadly instituted ranked choice voting, the zealous in each party lose their power to control the party, as ranked choice voting naturally leads to a selection more palatable to the voting population, which will favor more moderate candidates. With moderate candidates in place, the zealotry and showmanship of congressional members is no longer incentivized, as there is not a rabid base that controls the power for a politician to pander to and please. This will yield people willing to compromise and restore the filibuster to a tool that is more compromise driven and less obstruction oriented.

I understand, as a part of this argument, that while those in congress now can do something about the filibuster (there are differing legal opinions as to where that power lies) that they cannot do anything about broadly instituting ranked choice voting. My argument is not one based on what the senators themselves can practically do. It is geared toward a better path to a more desirable outcome.

Full disclosure for those who feel my political views are tangled in this and want to know my background. I don't think knowing this info will help defeat my argument, but I can understand those who want to know where I am coming from:

&gt;!I was raised conservative and was mostly conservative in my younger years, but I think that the current batch of Republicans is, to understate, very harmful to the functioning and even continuity of our government. I am not endorsing Republicans with this view or attacking Democrats. Instead, I am looking at the structure of the situation and I believe there is a better path toward our collective desire for a stable, functioning government.!&lt;"	11	58	0.62

My proposal may sound like a blatant contradiction of this principle but I hope to illustrate why I don't believe it is.

In a criminal trial, the burden of proof lies on the prosecution to demonstrate beyond all reasonable doubt that the defendant committed a certain crime. Cases of police killing are currently framed as the officer (defendant) against the state (prosecution). However, police officers are a part of the legal system, just on the ""enforcement"" side. To allow officers to carry guns implicitly grants them approval to kill in situations in which they consider it necessary to do so. These situations are analagous to a death row trial in which the officer is the prosecution and the victim is the defendant. However, in this case the officer has additionally acted as judge, jury, and executioner, and the sentence has already been carried out. The officer should be required to prove beyond reasonable doubt why that person's death was necessary in that moment; it should not be the state's job to prove otherwise.

Now, **if this were to be adopted, I don't think that it necessitates a criminal conviction for the officer** (bolded because too many comments have ignored this). If the officer is unable to establish sufficient justification for the killing, they should be fired from their job as an officer, forfeit any benefits they may have accrued from their job, and be barred from ever serving in law enforcement again. If you are truly in a situation in which you fear for your life, the idea of potentially losing your job should pale in comparison. I believe that this system would cause officers to re-evaluate the necessity of killing in the moment, and would provide incentive for things like body cameras which could prove their innocence of unjustified killing.

edit: there a lot of comments saying that this is how it already works. I've looked into it and found similarities to my proposal but what I've seen so far has key differences. **If anyone can provide a link to legislation or civil codes that require police officers who have killed on duty to be subject to an external review, the process of which resembles that of a typical criminal trial, then I will award a delta. Please note that even though I say that the process should resemble criminal trial, that does not mean that a criminal conviction is within the scope of this process.**

edit 2: I have to step away from this post for a while. For people to whom I've already responded, I will probably continue the discussion when I get back but otherwise I will most likely not be responding to any new top-level comments, as this post drew a lot more attention than I anticipated. Thank you everyone for your perspectives, even the comments that didn't change my mind gave me more to think about regarding this issue."	9438	643	0.89

However, in my opinion, the insistence on partitioning the world into current or past borders is sometimes straight-up laughable.

Take the Western Sahara as an example. An independent state in the region has no precedent, yet there are people (a lot of them) who claim there should be such an entity or that the locals should be given the right for self-determination. The basis of such claims is that the Spanish used to have a funny shaped colony there for a few decades. Meanwhile the area has been under Moroccan administration for a while, ""oppressing"" the Sahrawi Arabs, according to the most prelevant narrative in the West. This seems ridiculous to me. 

I'm not saying we should allow European states to attempt to drastically redraw their borders, nor am I advocating for changes for countries like Saudi Arabia or Iran. There are reasonable borders in the world that were created with a proper understanding of the ethnic and religious situation in the region, and they should be upheld in face of violence. Nor am I saying that the killing of innocent civilians should be tolerated.

For my purposes I would say any car 30+, is classic.

If you plan on driving a classic car as a daily driver or even semi frequently, you shouldn't 

There are two types of cars most people keep as classic cars.  Big comfortable cars or sports/muscle  cars.  Yes, there are some like Beetles, but those are outliers. Few people will restore a Chrysler K car or Chevy Citation.

First, they aren't as safe.  Even the most basic cars today are safer than classic cars.  Airbags, crumple zones, better cabin frames ect.  And most newer card have autonomous braking and blind spot ect as options. And depending how far back you go, no shoulder belts.

Second, they aren't as comfortable as their more current counterparts. Is a 1987 Towncar more comfortable than a 370z? Yes, but bit compared to modern full size luxury. A lot of cheap materials, a lot of vinyl.  Seats had fewer options to control.  Less creature comforts. Automatic windows are less common, no heated seats or steering wheel, no cooled seats ect.  Now not all new cars have these things but, most in the last 20 years have one and the last 10 likely to have more than one.

Third, speed is a common reason. Mustangs or Camaro or Corvette ect. They aren't that fast compared to today.  A 1969 Corvette 427 would do 0-60 in 6.0.  I drive a 2020 Volvo S60 T6 with a 4 cylinder engine and would hit 0-60 about 3/4 seconds faster.  And a dead heat in a quarter mile, in a car that weighs.a ton more.  My previous car would hit 0-60 in 1.6 seconds faster and 1.5 faster in a quarter mile. 

Also older cars were either 4 or maybe 5 speed manual transmissions.  Or 3 speed automatic. Newer cars are often 6-8 speed automatic and more efficient. And leads to smoother acceleration.  Gas mileage is better, better emissions.  Then there things like climate control and radios ect. 

Overall unless you are collecting, it doesn't make sense to own a classic car. That money could be put into a better car that doesn't look as ""cool"""	7	19	0.68

Also, would this constitute as a delta? If this appears disingenuous, I apologize.

Also some views are indeed changed. I am thinking in relation to the maslow hierarchy of needs, though as some of you pointed out fulfilling it from bottom to top is not strongly supported, and the higher tiers can fulfill lower tiers by going top-down. 

original:
Lets face it, human’s basic nature is to survive and ensure the species survive (through reproduction), so first we need food, water, health, shelter, security (through settlements, clans, nations even). When in a basic level only these matter, because survival is prime priority, without these the species would go “brr” - extinct.

Therefore, there is no point talking democracy to places where food, health, security is not even ensured yet, no one would understand how democracy is needed because they need other things first, therefore democracy is not a basic need but a need that only exists after you fulfill and sure you provide all those basic needs.

If you live in a first world democracy be grateful that you have these basic needs fulfilled, you may protest because that is your right (assuming it is written in your constitution), you may complain, but don’t act like your government is the worst in the world.

Views established,
1. Democracy is a higher tier need
2. First world citizens who live in a democracy, be grateful"	2	39	0.56

Bitcoins only value is it's scarcity. Mining bitcoin uses approximately ""87.1 TWh of electrical energy annually per September 30, 2019 (equaling a country like Belgium)."" (Vries, 2020).

As bitcoin becomes more valuable, more people and companies will mine bitcoin as the bitcoin price to energy price will tip into bitcoins favor. With more companies mining bitcoin, this will require more energy.

Bitcoin assesses how much power is being used to mine bitcoin and will increase the difficulty of the mining process to compensate.

So we have a country sized worth of energy waste each year that gets larger annually for something that does not  benefit the human race in a tangible manner.

If the money in bitcoin were placed into stocks at least that would provide jobs and drive innovation.

Change my view.

-A clone shall entertain the same rights as any other citizen

-The government cannot commission a series of clones for a militarized force, but any clone that wishes to join the military may do so.

-The donor and the clone are individual, separate entities

-Clones shall obtain citizenship in the same means and ways as all other citizens.

Here's why I think these work. 

The first, most important one, guarantees that a clone has bodily autonomy once it has fully gestated. 

The second one prevents any Clone Wars shenanigans.

The third confronts the philosophical question of what a human being is, giving the answer that it is not the DNA but the mind that makes the person. This also helps remove problems of a donor passing their problems off to their clone.

The last one was an afterthought, to prevent confusion when making decisions for the first.

THIS IS ONLY ABOUT REPRODUCTIVE CLONING. I am aware that this brings about other problems when going for therapeutic cloning, but I am not addressing that here.

I will try to explain my view from the job nature, education process and aspirations of a dentist.

&amp;#x200B;

The job nature of dentist itself is very unappealing, one essentially bent his back the whole day, staring into (probably) mouthes with rotten teeth, bleeding gums and smelling their bad breath. Day after day they repeat looking into mouthes, with little human connection, not to mention it's really tiring to be focused the whole day with no breaks. I cannot think of any reason anyone would want to do that if not for the money.

&amp;#x200B;

Becoming a dentist is hard as it requires you to be a top student in high school, and study for years about...teeth, not the most interesting topic in the world. Studying vigorously on such topics isn't typically fun/interesting. Whilst there are certainly execptions, I dont think many would pour in years of life into understanding teeth if not for the money.

&amp;#x200B;

What we always hear from doctors are: they aspired to become a doctor to change the world, to help people, or to cure xxx diseases because their family/friends suffered from it when they were a kid. These are all perfectly fine reasons, but I don't think they apply to dentists that well. Dentistry is a very specialised field without diseases as pressing as cancer/diabetes/parkinsons, sicknesses related to it are relatively mild too. Also, it sounds disingenuous to say 'I wanted to cure toothache since I suffered from it as a child.' It is like saying you wanted to become a doctor because you caught a flu when you are young.

&amp;#x200B;

It also isn't likely for one to become a dentist because they got rejected by med school, as dentistry usually has higher requirements that med school itself.

&amp;#x200B;

I genuinely cannot think of why anyone would want to be a dentist apart from its money prospect."	7	18	0.73

I’m really willing to learn if someone convinces me. Also, note - I’m from a country that generally has a different view on those issues, so it is possible that I’m culturally biased.

Also, I generalised the title a little bit - I didn’t know ho to say it shortly, but I mean it in a way that ANY trans person is not a “real” person-of-their-not-assigned gender. But I will focus on women since being women is what I know the best. 

My stance is pretty simple. In my point of view, being a woman means live as a woman from my birth. It means the weird patriarchal parts - being made to wear pink, having to have long hair, being stereotyped and often sexualised. It means having an escape plan when you are alone at a street at night, it means being uncomfortable because literally half the population is stronger than you. It means experiencing women’s puberty, the sexualising that comes with it... I could list all the exemples of bad things patriarchy brought us, but you get the message. 
All those bad parts formed me to who I am and I don’t know any woman who never experienced them. Maybe not all of them, but some probably. I don’t know many men who experienced the same.

Let’s say someone transitions at 20, he’ll, 30. They never knew how hard it is to grow up as a girl. How you can be told to cover up because boys might be distracted. Nothing of it. They maybe saw it and felt bad, but never experienced it. They begin to live as a woman later in life, after the worst usually ends, and with the “benefit” of male upbringing. Sure, it probably wasn’t the easiest being a trans person. But it wasn’t same as being a woman. And sadly, I think in today’s world, these bad experiences are almost always what forms women. 

I don’t think I can confidently say someone is “as much of a woman as I am” if they are treated like women for a couple of years after the worst part of it (at least for me) ends. Being an adult, it’s still not ideal, but your teacher can no longer tell you your shoulders could be distracting and if they do, you can tell them to fuck themselves. 

I think trans women (and men) are still that - trans women (and men). We shouldn’t merge those categories. We should celebrate the differences and getting comfortable with the fact, that being born a women (man)and being trans women is not the same thing. We all should have the same rights, we all should be loved and celebrated, but we are different - and we should be proud of that! Fuck, being woman has brought me so many problems and I’m proud to overcome them. You should be proud of overcoming problems of being trans person! I can’t claim your victory and you can’t claim mine - so why do it by merging those two categories?

Anything unclear I will specify. I’m not native English speaker.

Specification:
I wanted to highlight the difference in upbringing - I probably went to far with the suffering part. I meant that generally, formative years of cis and trans women are drastically different and thus those two genders should be perceived as different, not merge them together forcefully. I did not mean to make the problems my key argument."	91	122	0.64

But then I started feeling like I was being vulnerable by listening to music... like I've been developing my brain to be somewhat dependent on music in order to stay motivated to be alive.

I didn't want to become dependent on music. I didn't want to feel like I was feeding on a drug to escape reality. So I stopped listening to music, and now life feels boring, miserable and monotonous again.

As far as I am aware, the easiest and most affordable way to not keep feeling this way about life is to listen to music.

Apart from drafting and passing bills, the House and Senate also hold hundreds of committee hearings each Congress, perform investigations and publish reports, meet with constituents, help their states and districts cut through red tape at federal agencies, and help constituents access benefits like Social Security.

Any reason why the laws might disproportionately impact POC is because of racist individuals (like cops) or inherited social status (AKA its likely that the descendants of slaves might face poverty.) We can give extra support to these people, but it wouldn’t be solving the root issue of a racist social norm. Culture is something that changes through art, free speech, representation, and normalizing anti-racist sentiments. Considering how many Bollywood, Korean, and other foreign POC-centered TV shows are out there, plus the massive representation western television has been giving POC recently, there is no shortage of representation- same with books, comics etc. I’m guessing we are no more than a century away from defeating cultural racism once and for all. On the other hand, sexism and homophobia are not just cultural issues, but legal ones too that show little sign of change in the countries that need it most.

There are dozens of countries where being gay or trans is illegal and punishable by death. Even most secular and technologically advanced countries in Europe or Asia intentionally limit LGBT rights -either by not legalizing marriage, or transitions etc. The US just made gay marriage legal within the last decade. I don’t think there is a country in the entire world that doesn’t recognize the existence of POC, made it illegal for them to live there, or be punishable by execution, unlike lgbtphobia. 

As for woman’s rights, similar to my opinion on racism, there aren’t necessarily laws targeting them in the US, it’s more of a social and cultural issue here. However, it’s clearly a massive issue in other countries (looking as you, Saudi.) In Europe, there are laws banning women from certain jobs, especially in Russia. Same with Africa, the Middle East, South America, Asia, pretty much every continent. They could be executed, imprisoned, or tortured for things that men do on the daily- example: giving a fleeting glimpse of their ankles or hair. Women are legally deemed unclean and untouchable in many countries, and parents have been known to dismember their newborn if it comes out a female without facing legal punishment. I could go on but the horrors of misogyny are well known. None of this is legal or normalized to do to a man of color. Black men could vote before white women in the US. 

To wrap it up: The US and a scattering of other countries were the few in the world to legalize racism, and and that didn’t last very long. The main issue with racism is fighting cultural and social norms, which is a process that is moving forward every day. The remaining racism isn’t gonna be solved by pressuring politicians and signing petitions- it’s a rooted social norm that is consistently fading as the older conservative generations die off. 100 years ago, racial rights were both a massive legal and cultural issue, but nowadays, it’s been reduced to a scorned social norm that is fading by the daily. Meanwhile, LGBT rights are barely recognized. Even racists know that POC exist, but meanwhile, gays can be beheaded without a judge blinking an eye, assuming people think they exist in the first place. Woman’s rights are nonexistent in about 80 countries, and just seem to be regressing backwards. Because of this, I find myself focusing so much more energy on trying to fight homophobia and sexism, because it feels like something substantial can actually be done whereas in the US, fighting racism seems to be no bigger than writing “BLM ACAB” in your Twitter bio.

I’m not against fighting for POC rights (especially if it’s a productive method not rooted in performative social media posts,) but am moreso just a bit confused as to how racism is being put on an equal or greater pedestal to LGBT or woman’s rights when they seem so many miles apart. We could be using those energy and resources to pressure politicians in countries who are actually making strides to oppress their people. That’s what I’m leaning towards anyway, but seeing how people talk about racism these days like we’re back in the 18th century, my logic had gotta be tripping up somewhere."	0	19	0.5

I believe if you died of natural causes at a very old age (Maybe 82 plus would be good for setting a standard if NEEDED) you got the full package that life offers you and while everybody has the right to be sad, I believe we should be talking about all the wonderful things about you and give the respective person a cheers to a long and happy life. I don't think the sad vibe should be culturally expected at a funeral in this instance. It doesn't make sense to have everybody be sad even if they were a saint because they got the best thing they could get from life that some don't. I feel crying at these events would be expected but the black and gloomy vibe should be dropped and should instead consist of toasts and celebration. I got this thought from a post a while back that mentioned their Grandma was the kind of woman that was a partier and always lived life to the fullest, sounds like she got the best life she could get. So they through more of a party type celebration of their life instead. Just seems like that'd be warranted, although I guess anyone can do what they want I don't think that expectation is helping mourners instead it's just making them sadder. Well, I've made my case and this is how I feel. Interested to know if my view will be changed. Oops mind the grammar lmao	87	49	0.81
changemyview	t3_n7xj2t	https://www.reddit.com//r/changemyview/comments/n7xj2t/cmv_scientific_articles_should_not_be_openaccess/	2021-05-08 20:16:50	4amaroni	CMV: Scientific articles should not be open-access.	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/n7xj2t/cmv_scientific_articles_should_not_be_openaccess/	"On Reddit in particular, there is a strong push for free access to scientific articles that are often hidden behind a journal subscription or paywall. Comments that offer alternative solutions (email the author directly or search for the article on a number of search engines) are often highly upvoted. Other highly upvoted comments generally indicate that people want access to scientific journals without having to pay.

Open access to scientific articles is not necessary and would actually be detrimental to the process of discourse for three reasons 1) the average person is not sufficiently equipped to read, understand, and process the literature 2) trained individuals who do need access already do at no personal cost due to an association with an institution (university, government agency, private company) and 3) there are plenty of points of access for laymen through sites like [sciencedaily.com](https://www.sciencedaily.com/)

Even on Reddit where people tend to boast that the level of discourse is higher than that on Twitter or Facebook, it is a reoccurring meme that people don't even bother to read linked news articles. These articles are typically half a page to two pages of material. Scientific articles tend to be much longer and depending on the discipline, can require a fairly extensive background to read and comprehend. I have found that people without academic backgrounds generally struggle to read papers and have an even more difficult time summarizing the findings and scrutinizing the methodology. Reading comprehension is in fact a skill and can take years of training in an academic environment to flourish. The most well trained academics I know have the ability to read, retain, and articulate an insane amount of information. Meanwhile even on Reddit, people get into arguments that are often resolved with,""I literally did not say what you are accusing me of having said.""

Basic reading comprehension is already a widespread issue, and increasing access to dense literature does more harm than good. A personal anecdote - a user once linked me to an [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4890841/) on PubMed and argued that it was a source supporting her argument that obesity is not linked to health and she is thus a healthy person who happens to be obese. It's clear to me that she either did not read the article properly (most likely) or even worse, she did and completely misrepresented what the author wrote.

Open access would make these kinds of situations more and more common and could have consequences on authors' willingness to publish their findings when it comes to politically or socially charged areas of research. Imagine an author publishes their findings only for a mob on Twitter to demand their resignation or firing because the findings don't agree with their agenda.

Someone might argue that ""ok well there are always bad faith actors who will intentionally push sources that support their agenda despite evidence to the contrary."" To me, that is a part of being a well-equipped reader, acknowledging that you are always in danger of interpreting a source in a light that's favorable to yourself or what you support. No one is immune to that, and it can take a great deal of practice and self-awareness to avoid this issue.

Also, no one fucking understands statistics for shit.

The other two points are pretty self-explanatory. Anyone involved in the scientific field is associated with one or more major institutions that provide them with access to all sorts of journals and papers. At least in the US there is no one who lacks access to literature that need it. 

Furthermore, there are great resources out there like sciencedaily.com that make all sorts of new discoveries and scientific papers incredibly accessible at no personal cost. I think the whole ""free"" scientific papers discourse is inherently disingenuous and is just one of those trendy things to push for on social media.

**Δ View changed. Users have made very good points about how open access actually counters the issues I'm presenting and would make for a better situation than the status quo. Thank you for your comments everyone; I had a good time reading most of them, and sorry if I didn't get to your comment.**"	0	82	0.16

If we can't agree something's a problem, there's no point in discussing a solution. I'd like to avoid the reaction that ""if it's not Capitalism, it must be Socialism,"" because I don't think Socialism is the only alternative.

\-------------------------------

No 8-year old says, ""I want to grow up and spend as much money as I can on yacht's and houses I rarely use and spend most of my time entertaining people I don't like because they have money.""

Kids grow up with dreams of grandeur, often driven by some naïve form of ego, but certainly rooted in an aspiration for perceived greatness. I grew up with kids who all wanted to be astronauts, 4-star generals, and professional athletes. Even the modern craze of being a ""Youtuber"" is just professional entertainment.

Capitalism poisons this greatness. Growing up American, it seems everything about our culture is intended to reprogram us to seek to remove from the economy more than we individually contribute - to pursue a lifestyle which is completely unsustainable en masse and is deceptively improbable. Suddenly these childish dreams aren't the goal, they're the MEANS to the goal, they become a path to wealth. We don't feel fulfilled when we create something great, we expect fulfillment from wealth, and no amount of wealth is ever enough.

Every news story I read online now, I'm initially bombarded with popups. ""Subscribe to our Newsletter."" ""Accept notifications from this site."" ""&lt;Random Ad&gt;"" 2/3 of my mobile screen is full of advertisements at any given point in time. I have to be careful where I place my thumb when I scroll down as to not accidentally press an advertisement, and there's a significant chance that the screen will resize, causing me to touch an ad, or a full-screen ad will suddenly appear. These aren't one-off sites, either, these are mainstream media sites. Any ""news"" site that's for-profit. It's clear that ""good journalism"" is not the objective here - the objective is profit, and journalism is simply the vehicle. Real, quality journalism is dead at-worst and niche at-best, and we have Capitalism to blame.

It's not just journalism, it's everything. Electronic Arts is known for buying super-popular games and exploiting them in any way they can to turn a profit. US healthcare has been hijacked by capitalists in ways that don't need explanation. The stock market - once a vehicle for private investors, has simply become a way for financial institutions to siphon wealth from the lower classes seeking financial security. Art is nearly worthless unless it's ""high-art"", in which case it becomes yet another tool for either money-laundering or self-indulgence. Buying consumer goods may as well be playing the lottery - you have no idea if what you're buying is worth what you're paying, or if the company's just trying to sell a ""high-margin"" item, which frankly seems like a nice way of labelling a rip-off. And how many consumer products are ""designed to fail"" or incorporate ""planned obsolescence""?

And isn't that what capitalism is all about? Profit? What is profit, if not asking someone to pay more than its cost? And we, as a society, celebrate profits. The more profit you make, the better. i.e. The more your rip people off, the better. Technically, profit is the money you make after your expenses. I understand that there's some nuance here, but let's not get hung up on it, because it's not the nuance that's ruining our culture; capitalism preaches an obsession with profit - with charging more for something than it costs to create.

I think we all see this as ""normal"" and I really don't think it has to be. There are so many subcultures which lead happy and fulfilling lives that don't revolve around one person's dream to live a better life than everyone else (and everyone sharing that common delusion). I genuinely feel like Capitalism is a lie that was sold to poor people by the rich to deceive them into believing that they, too, have a chance to be rich, if they work as hard as possible to make the rich richer. We should all know better - we can't all be rich. Is this really who we want to be? Do we really want to live better than everyone else? Are we so selfish?

We should all be working to make the world a better place, and we could be if we were all pursuing excellence within ourselves and our passions, and prosperity for others. Capitalism teaches the opposite - to expect excellence from others and prosperity for ourselves. It's inherently selfish. Americans are programmed for self-indulgence by a capitalist culture. We're eager to sacrifice the quality of our work for profit. We're willing to deceive others in the name of profit. We exchange the pursuit of excellence for the desire to deceive and exploit others. And we're all guilty of this in some way - we demand equality so long as we're the victims of inequality, but the moment we benefit from inequality, we relish and defend our privileged positions as something we've ""earned"" and to which we're thus entitled.

We need to stop praising capitalism and seek an socio-economic paradigm that encourages philanthropy, cooperation, and prosperity for all, not just ourselves. We should seek to create the highest quality product, not the highest selling one. Capitalism corrupts these dreams and turns a society of bright and passionate people into greedy drones willing to sacrifice their own happiness (and that of others) for prosperity that others couldn't realistically share."	0	178	0.42

I was absolutely enthralled from the jump. I could fit entire libraries of music from a litany of bands and genres on one device that could fit in my pocket. I never considered there could be anything else, I thought that it could never get any better than that. I was in love.

Then the first iPhone came out. My best friend had gotten one first and i must admit I was jealous. It was so sleek, it had a touchscreen, it could make calls and texts in addition to holding all my music! It could access the internet, it had GPS, it has a much better camera than my shitty Motorola Razr. How can i live without one?!

Then I got one. It was everything I wanted and more. I was the happiest I could be. The genesis of my lifelong love of gadgets had begun.

Anyways, I stuck with the iphone loyally for a few generations. I was the perfect age when it was released. High school me was not very discerning and was easily impressed by the latest and greatest tech. Android wasn't even on my radar then, I was perfectly content with my first gen iphone.

After the first couple generations I switched to Android after researching the device I was interested in. I couldn't understand how on paper it could have beaten the iPhone in almost every respect. I decided to make the switch, figuring this Android would be the last cell phone I'd ever buy. I've been through at least half a dozen since, and I remain loyal to Android to this day.

I can't understand why Apple can get away with charging exorbitant amounts of money for relatively run of the mill specifications. I can understand when it comes to PC vs. Mac, as I studied audio production and such a task is much more amenable to Apple's operating system as opposed to Windows. Even so, it still seemed silly that Apple was charging far more for the essentially the same hardware.

So, what is it? Is it the software? Some appeal of the UI itself? Brand loyalty? This is one of those opinions I have which could be swayed if someone comes in leaving a response which berates me for the error of my ways. So I want your guys' experience with Apple products. What makes them preferable to an Android in the case of cellphones, or other operating systems when it comes to laptops and desktops? Why should I trade in my Samsung for an iPhone tomorrow? Why should I pawn all my worldly possessions for a beat up iMac on eBay?

Not only could I be swayed, I almost *want* to be swayed. As I mentioned, in terms of audio production, Apple reigns supreme. I'm looking for an excuse to justify such a wildly expensive purchase. So I'm asking you all, from the bottom of my heart, to change my view!

Times eight students who need them is $200,000 a year). Some of these students literally have their hand held or are rolled around in a wheelchair. They can walk just fine. The problem is that they aren’t mentally capable of navigating the building. 

Additionally many teachers have to take an entire period block just to teach five or six of these students. Normal class sizes reach the dozens. These two factors in conjunction mean that the school is spending way more time and money on a few students compared to the regular student population. All for what? 

Sure, these students technically got their diplomas, but the fact that they took special Ed on their diplomas mean that any employee will no it was basically guaranteed to them. Yes, technically they can’t legally discriminate based on mental illness, but that’s near impossible to prove in criminal court, and even if you ignore that, they could still be fired day 1 simply based on the fact that they can’t navigate a building, let alone perform the duties a job would require.

Workplace democracy/democratic workplace (used interchangeably): a system of organising a workplace in which all workers there have equal right to participate in management. This can mean collective meetings to outline the basic goals of an organisation or the right to elect/fire managers. They make up a very small minority of current workplaces.

Non-democratic workplace: One in which those rights are absent. They can exist in the private or public sector.

**Basic argument:**

Democratising the workplace improves productivity and worker happiness.

I believe this for 3 reasons:

* The vast majority of evidence that I have seen (I am open to the possibility that I have missed something) indicates that democratic workplaces that function in market economies have higher rates of productivity and worker happiness than workplaces in the same industry in similar circumstances.

[https://www.uk.coop/sites/default/files/2020-10/worker\_co-op\_report.pdf](https://www.uk.coop/sites/default/files/2020-10/worker_co-op_report.pdf)

* That when a workplace is forcibly converted into a truly democratic one (not like Yugoslavia's old model) that workers self-report greater productivity and happiness, productivity increases have also been confirmed by outside observers.

Taken from chapter 11 of the 2014 book New Forms of Worker Organization: The Syndicalist and Autonomist Restoration of Class Struggle Unionism which covers workplace takeovers during strikes in Australia in the 1970s, most famously at the Sydney Opera House construction site.

* That the rarity of workplace democracy in market economies being explained by lower productivity is not sufficient. As that conflicts with the two points listed above and misunderstands why certain businesses become common. Workplace democracy struggles with finance and people just generally being unaware of its existence as a concept.

**What am I not arguing:**

* We *ought* to push for more democratic workplaces. I'm making is/prescriptive claims, not ought/normative claims.
* That democratic workplaces don't possibly have other downsides.
* That people if you oppose or don't support workplace democracy, that you therefore must not value productivity and worker happiness.

**Arguments I don't care about:**

* How you feel or what you intuit would happen in a democratic workplace. If you think your personal feelings trump evidence. I don't know what to tell you, you've got a lot of growing up to do."	11	61	0.63

The only upgrade was the white seats, so +$1K. With taxes and all fees, it was $57,453.84. I financed at 2.49%.

Soon after, I experienced buyer's remorse, feeling like it was an extravagant purchase. I certainly don't need a Tesla. I don't even drive that much because I work from home. And I don't need a Model Y specifically (I have no kids and my dog fits fine in a compact car).

I got some quotes and I could sell it for $56,650, losing just $800 dollars. Given that I was able to joy ride in this amazing car for a week or so, I wouldn't feel bad about the $800.

However, after some intense mental gymnastics, I'm convinced that it's best to keep the car.

Relevant details that went into my decision:

* If I didn't get a Tesla, I'd probably get a compact car - specifically a Mazda3. This would probably be about $25K out the door, also financed at a low APR
* I have a small, private garage where it can charge (albeit slowly due to it being a standard outlet). I do not pay for the electricity in that garage - my apartment complex does. I don't think they anticipated electric car owners :) So that's free energy for most of my driving for as long as I live here
* The Tesla is very likely going to retain high resale value, so if I sold it within 2-8 years (which is likely), total cost of ownership may be on par or lower than if I got the Mazda, especially considering no gas or oil changes.
* The payment isn't burdensome to me. My insurance payment is very reasonable because I have USAA, which offers great rates (it's limited to military and military family). So the real goal is not having a high total cost of ownership compared to other vehicles (see previous bullet point).
* As for my personal preference, I like the car a lot, and all things being equal, I'd prefer to drive it over other cars. It has so much more power than my prior car (a Corolla). I love the tech and the fact that it receives frequent update. I know robotaxis seem far off, but the thought that I *might* get to participate that is really cool. Finally, dog mode is a game changer for me because I take my dog everywhere.
* One more point is that I could potentially rent this car out on Turo, making some extra dough, because Teslas are in demand. Not sure how inclined I am to do that, given the risks...

**edit:** Please keep in mind that I'm not willing to buy an old used car for super cheap, so please don't use that as the alternative. If I don't keep the Tesla, I would get a new or relatively new Mazda3 or similar, probably for about 25K. I need a decent infotainment and other modern conveinences."	0	37	0.36

A speciesist is a person who discriminates against other creatures based on their species. Remember that includes humans.

So why do I think this is good whereas discriminating against other groups is bad?

First off, I want to get this out of the way, I do not think that discrimination is bad. I think that discrimination is neutral. It is the context that makes it good or bad. It's okay to discriminate against people based off of their height, their personality, their behavior, or the shirt they're wearing. It's not okay to discriminate against people based off of something they can't control. And yes that includes religion.

Okay so you understand that I think that discrimination is not inherently bad, in case you thought I was against all discrimination or something. So here's why I think it it is okay to be a speciesist even though you also can't control your species? The thing is, when we discriminate against other humans they are either things that a person can control or it doesn't really matter. It doesn't really matter for person's skin is white or black because it's not like black people have the ability to shoot laser out of their eyes and white people don't. No it's just a skin color. This is often the case for a lot of things like the food that we like or our hair color, or the ethnic group were a part of. This is not the case for species. Lions have the ability to tear through flesh with their teeth and bunnies do not. I'm not discriminating against a lion because of some minor difference in them compared to me, I'm discriminating against them because they have teeth that can chew my face off.

We discriminate against different species all the time and it's fine. For example it's okay to have a dog or cat as a pet, it's not okay to have a tiger or a lion as a pet. The difference is literally in their species. A tiger or a lion is a wild animal but a cat or a dog is a domesticated species. They either domesticated themselves or we domesticated them.

Annually only about four people die due to roller coasters related failures, some just being staff and faculty who work there, and not the guests who visited them. And with other statistics you would See that you’re more likely to die on the way to the theme park then at one. Even more you’re more likely to die on the small rides they have than any roller coaster that you would go on. And as safety has improved in the past couple of decades we’ve seen less and less fatalities due to roller coasters malfunctions every year. Most roller coaster fatalities occur in places where their safety measures aren’t as good, such as in Financially strained countries. And to add on to this, most roller coaster related injuries are caused by patrons who do not follow the rules put in place by The manufacture and the park staff. 

Ride operators go through mandatory training before being allowed to work on a roller coaster, they have an experience ride operator always by their side while their in training, and furthermore aren’t allowed to be unsupervised for a few days. 

The manufacturers have also put in work to make sure that their rights are up-to-date and are as safe as possible. Better Materials  and better equipment is used to help manufacture the roller coasters that the park has asked for. Resulting in smoother and better right experiences for all guests. 

Media has also played up the danger of roller coasters. Show many images of ride stopped in ride Hills and in other areas where they’re meant to be stopped. Claiming the ride is dangerous and that it isn’t working properly. When in fact whenever it is stopped the ride is actually working as intended. The ride sensed a problem and decided to shut down, leaving the cars on lift hills in places where they are safe and will not continue onto the track into possible dangerous situations. Even more so most of these ride stoppages are caused by overly sensitive sensors that accidentally go off, meaning more often than not, the ride is in perfect working order.

In certain weather conditions the ride is not even allowed to run in the first place, such as in Highwinds or in rain.

All of the safety measures are put in place to keep you safe while at a park, and as we see technology go further and further we will see better and better roller coasters with the most pristine safety measures put in place all to keep everything safe.

This is why roller coaster shouldn’t be seen as dangerous"	19	58	0.74

And I believe these reasons will be the cause of a third world war

Misunderstandings and territorial disputes were a major cause of WW2 and they are still present almost everywhere from europe with Urkain/Russia to asia, China/Taiwan, China/India, N.Korea/S.Korea and the middle east with Israel/Palestine, Israel/everyone else and many more. It seems that tensions are high everywhere and everyone on this planet wants to fight over some piece of land/religion/ideology, very similar to what happen before ww2.

Another striking similarity is the effectiveness of the UN, or rather the lack of it. During the interbelic period The league of nations was considered a shining beacon for diplomacy, even tho it was largely ineffective, countries were able to leave it without any major penalties ( Germany ) or just ignore it and continue expanding ( USSR ). Same thing is present in our modern day world, just under a different name The UN, it is almost useless because if anything is done in against one of on the nations in alliance with Russia/China they will just veto it.

The third reason I believe a World War is invincible is due to the radicalization of politics; not necessarily in the west but everywhere else this includes India/China/Russia/Ukraine/Most of the eastern European states/The whole of the middle east/, everyone hates everyone and this brings a ideological reason to a possible war, again something similar to what happens in the interbelic period; and this point also reflect NATO, its hard not justifying a war for ideological reasons, China has concentration camps present and is using slave labour, couple that with a oppressive regime, you got what looks like a neo-hitler sate.

One thing people tend to point out when talking about a third world war is the mutual assured destruction brought by nuclear weapons, and I believe that is not the case; sure a world war will be a horrible thing with millions of casualties but I do not believe nuclear weapons will be used. My reasoning is that Let's say that The US declares war on Russia, Russia has 2 options a) initiate a nuclear attack or b) fight with conventional warfare. One of these is a lose/lose situation for everyone, and one of them is a Win/Lose situation for someone, Russia might as well surrender if it believes there is no hope, and in during so it will lose but it wont kill 99% of the human race, or it could fight conventional warfare and hope for the best. And in doing so it it may lose but it's still better then nuclear annihilation, in other words if everyone has nuclear weapons no one has them.

Due to these 4 reasons I believe another world war is looming over the horizon, I really hope someone can change my mind because this does not look good at all."	15	34	0.7

Athletes who are trans women have a natural advantage from going through male puberty and being born as males, and it is simply unfair to allow them to compete with cis women. However, athletes who are trans men have a natural disadvantage, so if they’re able to be competitive against cis men, they should be allowed to compete.

I also think it’s fair to look at things in a case-by-case basis: if someone began their transition before puberty, then there’s room to discuss. However, for this specific post, I’d like to focus on people who transition in their late teens or later.

Trans women have been shown to have more muscle mass than cis women years after transition. They have been shown to have higher bone density, and they will (on average) be taller. It’s not fair to cis women that trans women should be allowed to participate in their sports. 

So… CMV?

Edit: this has gotten more replies than I thought it would and a lot of you are making similar arguments, so I may not reply to everything, but I promise I’m reading everything.

Edit 2: Had some super thought provoking replies, am thinking them over. I’m not sure anyone will be able to 180 me on this issue but people are definitely making me consider how/why I came to this conclusion and alternate solutions that work better than sex/gender segregation in sports.

Edit 3: u/ThinkingAboutJulia changed my mind. They didn’t try to convince me that trans women didn’t have an advantage over cis women, instead they got me to reframe how I view that advantage. I’m not sure if it’s a full 180 mind change, but I would definitely say my new default is let a trans woman compete, not vice versa. Still think some cases shouldn’t be allowed, but again: they changed my default."	20	100	0.63

This is a value judgement and not a economic debate, so trying to convince me that if the wealthy owners just got a little more money it ""would inevitably trickle down to the rest of the American peasants, just give them another 50 years you'll see"" will not convince me.

Not only is that mentality a roundabout way of saying, ""you can do whatever you want to me and I won't do anything about it"", but it's HIGHLY insulting to people that have been abused especially. If someone's ADULT parents beat them up as a child, and you're telling that person that they ""need to be the bigger person"" and essentially bottle up their anger and let those people get away with it, you're just adding to people's despair. 

I agree that in a lot of situations, that's a warranted mentality. But there's a lot more where blowing up and getting your anger out on someone who /literally/ deserves it is warranted. 

Example: Both of my parents were extremely abusive and I ended up in Foster Care, when they tried to contact me years later, I said some things that most humans probably SHOULDN'T say to another person, intentionally made them cry, and then blocked both of them. I don't, and will never think I was the asshole for what I said, I had spent literally YEARS ""being the bigger person"" and trying to calmly explain to them what they had done and constantly being ignored and belittled and ridiculed. The only thing that finally set me on the path to closure and healing was when I finally got the chance to ""get back at them"", and get my anger out."	83	55	0.84

Imagine a utopia in the future, a perfect world with no crime, no poverty, no health problems. Everyone there is challenged enough to be happy without any desperation. Would this be a good thing? Would you be in favor of this future world? 

What if I told you that everyone in the future world is Muslim and of middle eastern decent. No other races or ideologies in the whole planet. Is this future still good? 

A feel like a lot of people would balk at this idea because of an innate evolutionary desire to spread our own personal genes and in a broader more cerebral sense to propagate our own ideology and ways of life. We want a future full of people ""like us"". But I don't believe in a strictly moral sense that a good future has to have people like myself in it. It just has to be good. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the book ""Children of Time"" (amazing book btw. Highly recommend it), one of the primary conflicts is that some humans want to seed planets with an altered form of earth life so that life can spread through the cosmos even if humanity fails. Kind of hedging the bets so intelligent life has a better chance of continuing. Many people are aggressively opposed to this line of thinking (the ""exultation of beasts""), reasonably asserting this would arbitrarily create competition for future humans and possibly lead to a certain degree of risk for the species as a whole. 

&amp;#x200B;

Humans have a precarious future ahead of us. Evidence suggests that there is a 1/5 chance that we, as a species, won't even make it 200 more years. [https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/reports/2008-1.pdf](https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/reports/2008-1.pdf)

My view is that:

\-It is important for intelligent life to exist or else there is nothing to appreciate the universe for what it is.

\-Humans (and to a lesser degree other earth life) is so far the only intelligent life discovered and there is a non-zero chance that it intelligence could be a vanishingly rare phenomena

\-A good future can exist even if it involves those who are different than myself

All of these points together mean that, even if there is a certain degree of risk involved, it is worth it to propagate life in the universe if we're some day able to create it whether that life is some sort of super-intelligent AI or altered earth life like in Children of Time. 

&amp;#x200B;

What won't change my mind:

\-Don't argue with the veracity of the source. It's unreasonable to assume that humanity will exist for all eternity even if you don't agree with the source. Now if you want to prove that there's a good reason to think humanity will last forever fine, but don't make that argument based on a negative assertion of my source. the source being wrong != you being right.

Edit: to sum up the deltas so far: people may have values differing from those that want to see life diversify and continue. Any effort to seed life elsewhere should be done with those values in mind. Basically don't make an AI if it's gonna risk the people on earth currently"	17	92	0.67

 But what happens when digital algorithms of social media carve a ""you-shaped hole"" for you to fall into? That's the goal of the attention monopolists, to manufacture a digital place that fits exactly as you are, to grip you as long as possible. That generates tens of thousands of cultures whose values are INVERTED to a functioning society. And it must be that way, because the only way to mesmerize people indefinitely is with base gratification. Instead of becoming ""well adjusted"" to other people we become more extreme versions of ourselves.

 Incel as a culture exists now, where the norm is to reject responsibility for your functioning and self-worth as a human being, and the only value for you to aspire to is **revenge**. A culture like that is not refining, it's endlessly degenerating toward our 
most shameful and reflexive rationalizations. Any system which rewards people for less and less discipline and more and more extreme ideas like that is pathological, and I would say evil. Now, every paranoid delusion, resentful sentiment, one dimensional idea has an entire culture based around it. A person thinks they have **THE** answer to the world's problems and '*poof*', they get to live in a reality where their thoughts are unanimously validated by their new friends as meaningful and true.

 Sanity isn't simply your brain as a punch bowl filled with the proper mix of chemicals. One way to think about it is that sanity is outsourced to the network of people around you. Everybody you interact with is clueing you in to how they expect you to act through a plethora of verbal and nonverbal cues. We constantly adjust ourselves toward this aggregate of norms. Social media bombards you with not just qualitative feedback of praise and ridicule, but also **quantitative feedback** of an objective measure of your contribution and conformance to the culture. Our very definition of sanity is being shaped by these enormously persuasive and unprecedented forces.

Ideas that diverge from the established narrative of a digital culture are suppressed more effectively than any flesh and blood totalitarian government could dream of. In the exclusion of external viewpoints, the stated value system (often a single train of thought) runs to the unchallenged and final conclusion of it's beliefs. Which allows for the abdication of personal responsibility and ultimate demonization of people, human norms, and the foundational systems of society. 

One definition of humanity is our restraining or generous conscious effort toward the wellbeing of the network of people around us. That's what we've been selling to inhabit a digitally gratifying space, where everything we think is validated as reality. For now only the most self-absorbed and desperate for blame people have lost it completely. 

But consider that if there's a billion people on the internet. And tech giants, who track every click and tap we've ever made, have a couple thousand data points per person  (speaking very conservatively). Then that's trillions of microscopic details of the autonomous functioning of our consciousness. After correlating these trillions of points between each other, and between each billion person, with their exponentially more powerful computers and algorithms, then we are going to be sucked more deeply into our own [you-shaped hole](https://i.imgur.com/FqrAFKn_d.webp?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=medium). As we fall deeper into these ideological holes we will become more twisted and starved of the discipline essential for joy while losing consciousness into a haze of animalistic pleasure. It's barely been a decade since social media came to existence, so where are we going to be 40 years from now? 

The only way to elevate ourselves beyond this race to the bottom of our own personal hole is the widespread adoption of nonprofit, empathic social media."	0	20	0.49

Some have argued that this is an unjustifiable example of authoritarian government overreach that is inhibiting on an individual's civil liberties.

I disagree with this claim because:

The vaccine passports help prevent the spread of disease and death and they prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed. Not to mention it would be less costly on the tax payer because we don't need to pay for as much medical equipment to treat the sick. Wouldn't the propagation of these risks and costs by a small minority make them the unjustifiable authoritarians?

Also, at least in democratic nations, these mandates are put in place by democratically elected officials who have the consent of the governed to do so.

Also, some people like to claim that ""the government"" is some ethereal malicious entity. But, at least in democracies, it really is just a socially constructed idea that people already submit some amount of freedom to in exchange for the protection this concept provides. Buildings are built to code, inspections are completed, speed limits are enforced etc. And, as in those instances, the vaccine mandates are not an example of authoritarian over reach."	1	109	0.51

I've grown up watching  Samurai X, Gundam Wing and the original run of the DragonBall series and i can say the English voice actors were all top notch.

In fact, many of the alpha male characters have annoyingly high pitched *unmanly* voices in the original japanese dubs.

For example...Kenshins sounds like a girl, in the Japanese dub, so does Goku from DragonBall Z.


Sometimes I think the folks boasting about the dubs are just showing off their understanding of Japanese.

Anti-imigration: Even if you believe that immigrants are ""bad for the country"", being anti-imigration means focusing on your own needs and disregarding/devaluing the needs of said imigrants.

Anti-welfare: I know the right wing media loves to dehumanize and villainize the poor and recommends ignoring being compassionate towards them in order to help non-poor people. I recognize that not all Republicans view the poor this way and are instead anti-welfare because they view the government as being incompetent at managing it - but there are certain programs (like funding school lunches for poor children) that I can't fathom not supporting without just being completely without compassion.

Anti-taxes: Taxes are used to fund things that benefit everyone - schools, infrastructure, fire departments, etc. I can understand believing that the current tax dollars aren't being spent responsibly (I agree with that sentiment even), but being so supportive of obscenely low taxes (or wanting none at all like the Tea Party did iirc), seems like another example of caring about oneself more than the needs of your community.

Anti-government regulations: Honestly, this one I don't understand at all. Wanting to be able to make a fast buck by being allowed to pollute to your heart's content or exploiting your workers because you won't be suffering the consequences of doing so is just straight up evil to me.

On the higher end of the scale espically (comfortable middle class to wealthy) but even on the lower end of the scale (lower class) few people are enlisted for the military in any capacity. ([https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/demographics-us-military](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/demographics-us-military)). From the lower class position, I doubt this does much harm. Poor people aren't deciding whether of not a country goes to war, so even if they never had any skin in the game, it wouldn't be that much of a problem.

However, the bigger disparity and the bigger issue is among the upper classes which are very unlikely to go to war. Moreover, a lot of people who go to war are people who otherwise wouldn't get into university, both the wealthy and the white collar classes are disproportionately disconnected from the actual affects of war in the status quo, but also are disproportionately able to make the final call on when people actually do go to war.

This seems to lead to very real harms. Currently veterans around the world in highly industrialized countries are disproportionately likely to be homeless and struggle to get established. Often assistance offer to them is lacking a weak. Moreover, it is not impossible to do better for these people, the second world war and the response to these soldiers returning home bears witness to that. On a different note, wars and general conflict seem to have little consideration to the lives lost as a result. About 5000 soldiers from the US and its allies died in Iraq, probably for the control of oil in the region. But even if the war would have been worth it to the average American, even if the average American values lower gas prices or whatever over 5000 lives, the response to veterans is unreasonable.

A randomized draft would negate this. That would force any economic, racial, or religious community to consider the reality that anyone in that community within an appropriate age range could be chosen to go to war. This would force those who decide to go to war to consider the soldiers perspectives. Obviously the very wealthy would be able to avoid drafts through scams and such like they did in the past, but 1) the very wealthy, in my experience, are usually in the same social circles as the somewhat wealthy, so yes they won't be worrying about their sons and daughters, but they will be worrying about their friends, and 2) I like the idea of rich politicians having to explain why they didn't go to a war they were supposed to go to (e.g. bone spurs).

A second reason is that draft dodging is, as we learned from Vietnam, a serious problem that arises from trying to make people go to war, so it's likely that politicians would be forced to consider how popular a war is. I personally don't think a war should happen because 52% of the population likes it, I feel like it should be much more unanimous. Moreover, if someone is drafted by politicians X and they dodge it they're much less likely to ever vote for politicians X ever again, and that alienation would be politically detrimental. Moreover, forcing people to fight for stuff they don't believe in is hard. So politicians wanting to declare war would have to pursue bipartisan support form the public before hand.

EDIT: Someone reminded me that the military is a professional force. I forgot that would have to be a consideration, but they were completely correct. That would mean that in order to have everyone equally have skin in the game, people would always be being drafted, but most of the time even the military wouldn't have to go to war. That actually might avoid some of the draft dodging. Lets say for 25 years there is not war. It's not like every rich family will always pay their way out because that would be super expensive, but then when a war starts they won't have time to pay their families way out, and their family will have already been drafted, so it's harder to undo that.

EDIT: My view has been changed. The argument that in training people who don't want to be there make more mistakes was made by someone who was apparently experienced in the field was made, and initially I was skeptical, since my conception of training accidents was that they weren't that important, but I looked it up ([https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/06/politics/us-military-deadly-accidents/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/06/politics/us-military-deadly-accidents/index.html)), and apparently they are more significant than conflict in military deaths, so yeah. Probably not a good idea the exacerbate the phenomena of trainees killing each other by accident, which is a hell of a lot bigger of an issue than I initially thought."	0	88	0.41

Fox News has been fearmongering a number of education issues (CRT, school mask mandates, etc) and school board elections are becoming increasingly politicized as a result.  

I don’t believe people without school aged kids should have a say in how children’s education is managed.

Edit: the common argument is “if I pay taxes, I should get a say” but there’s plenty of government spending (public services, defense, etc) where you have no say in how the money is spent beyond a general allocation.  I absolutely believe people without kids should still be able to vote for millages or other tax allocations.  But school board policy doesn’t affect them.  

Perhaps I am advocating instead for a diminished role of the school board (i.e. they shouldn’t be allowed to set public health policy or make curriculum decisions)."	25	161	0.57

This all started after reading an old newspaper article involving a pregnant unwed teenager in the 50's/60's; a long holiday to an 'aunt'; the forced adoption of the baby; forcing the pain away and later marrying and having children; the adult child rocking up unannounced on the doorstep looking for answers and love; the confession to the family of the traumatic adoption; and, the subsequent breakdown of the marriage because the revelation caused the husband (and 2 out of 3 kids) to doubt their entire world and her place in it.  The devastation of the family unit struck me as sad and unnecessary and I wanted to try to understand. 

I wanted to see if there was a broader and universal truth (Kantian for the interested) around betrayal and doubts that could be applied to all sorts of secrets in previously solid and unquestioned relationships. 

I tried to keep the definition of secret broad in my mind to give room for nuance and empathy for both parties if possible.  I thought of the loving and dutiful wife that had an abortion in the early days of the relationship; the partner that was squirreling away money.... or debt; an undisclosed and traumatic past; the person who cheated and had genuine regrets. I searched peer reviewed research, online psychology articles, interrogated friends and family. I read a lot of personal opinions on social

All of that listening and thinking (and researching), over a few weeks and through some rabbit holes led me to an unexpected but solid conclusion.  And that is this:

 If a secret has been taken to the deathbed, it should be taken to the grave. 

I came to believe that the deathbed confession would surely be cowardly and selfish with the primary motive to relieve guilt. Therefore only likely to leave hurt and betrayal in a situation where the only person able to explain is dead. That's cruel and not about honesty.

The arguments against my conclusion are easy to define. The aggrieved may find out another way and be robbed of the right to an explanation... therefore confess. The aggrieved should not be deceived a moment longer so, imminent death notwithstanding,  confess. Previous assessments of unnecessary hurt caused were self-justifying and all pretences should be put aside in these final moments, so confess. Yet all of these consequences and beliefs seem to my mind to reinforce the truth of my conclusion.  For every universal belief the existence of a counter argument doesn't lessen the fundamental truth but merely serves as a reminder that we are human and fallible.

So, my view is clearly stated in the subject title. Can you change it?"	46	68	0.82

As I started to take more attention to this issue of customer service, I can honestly tell you that I believe it's becoming a big problem for the customer.   In the last three weeks, I was in California, Virginia, and Florida, and there was one common theme - the customer not always the priority.  I understand that not all industries/companies are having these issues, but in my experience, it's noticeable across the country and in multiple industries (transportation, food and beverage, etc.). In my view, here are a few reasons why I believe we are seeing this decline:

1. Size of the Workforce - The size of the workforce has decreased as a result of the pandemic, and some businesses can't find employees to hire.  Wages and stimulus may have something to do with it, but maybe it's just the mindset that many have opinionated on r/antiwork. 

Without saying anything to them about the lack of service they were providing, I asked them if the company they were working for was hiring, and every time, they said that they are trying to hire but no one was applying.  This was the case in Paso Robles CA at a winery, a food court in the Tampa International Airport, and a Pizza joint in Virginia.  The Food Court in the airport (that had 5 different venues) actually closed at 6PM because they didn't have the employees to keep it open.  Employees are working harder than ever due this lack of workforce, and it's hard to blame them for the level of customer service provided.

2. Employees are on their phones while at work - Just yesterday, I was ordering food at a restaurant location, and the cashier behind the counter was on their phone while ringing me up for payment.  Two days ago, at a McDonald's in the drive through, the cashier was on her phone as I handed her my debit card.  It's not only rude to the customer but also shows complete disregard for attention to the service they are providing and quality of work.  This could be a managerial problem, but it also may be a ""give a sh\*\* factor"" based upon the given wage.  I guess regardless of the effort that they put in, they are still getting paid the same.

3. Customer Service Departments (by phone) for some companies are woefully undermanned - After being cancelled for a flight this weekend during the airline debacle, I called the airline's customer service line and the wait was greater than 4 hours.  I asked for a call back and it took 10 hours to receive a call back, even though my place in line was apparently held.  It shouldn't take more than 10 minutes to talk to someone on the phone to book a new flight.  For the same issues, I had to extend my rental by phone because my flight was cancelled the other day.  It took me over 10 minutes just to find an actual number to call, and when I made the call, it prompted me through an automation of question after question.  30 minutes later, I was finally on the line with someone I could talk too.  Unfortunately, it was difficult to understand what he was saying (heavy foreign accent), and there were people laughing in the background like someone just told a joke or something.

All of these examples could have been just a bad string of luck, but the more and more I am aware of the level of service that I experience, it doesn't meet the level that I once expected.  Maybe my expectations are too high.  I'm more interested in your comments and thoughts, to potentially change my view."	22	100	0.7

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks.

&amp;#x200B;

\----- Old post.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: I mean AMERICA, and America only. Not West. I have many Occidental, and Oriental friends.

But you know who I cannot be friends with? Americans. They're just not compassionate. I hope you can change my opinion on this, I'm 100% open to it.

Three examples:

1- What America is doing to my country, Iran. You're sanctioning us, it's hurting people, I don't care if you're trying to punish the ""pariah"" government, I don't care that the Iranian government oppresses its people. Your sanctions thwart societal upheaval, stops young Iranians like me to become independent and make changes, and I bet you would want that because a progressive Iran is an Iran you can't justify sanctioning. Your brains are rotten to the core with anti-Iranian propaganda. You think our women ""wear burqas"" and cannot drive. You think we're Arabs because you're too dumb to understand what 'Arab' means and don't realize how offensive it is to call an Iranian Arab! You think ALL Iranians are religious zealots whilst it's chockful of atheists like me. You have the mental capacity of a 2 year old, if you can't see something, it probably doesn't exist! You can't make decisions for yourselves so you elect old f\*ckt\*rds who abuse you and take you for a ride. An American 'statesperson' just becomes a statesperson to fill up his pocket with lobbyist money. I'm not saying Iran is a good country BUT I DON'T IDENTIFY MYSELF WITH MY COUNTRY. I am, foremost, a human. But you put your Amernicanness and your nation state in front of all your decisions. American is not a nationality for you people, it's an IDENTITY. What I'm saying applies to most older people, people ages 35-80, but what's worse is that younger people in your country are no better which brings me to..

2- The ""simp"" behavior. Hear me out, not every gallant act is simping! Not every person who helps a person of the opposite sex out is a 'simp'! Maybe in your rotten brains, every person who helps someone is looking after something in return. But it's not the case in majority of the situations. Someone pays a girls' rent, he may also pay a guy's rent! When you have money you are obligated to help people around you. When you're fortunate you MUST look after other people. It's this ""mine! mine! mine!"" attitude that will be the downfall of America and somewhere in the near future you all will be so involved with yourselves and forgot your brethren and sistren than you will ultimately fail to recognize who's in need, and your only drive for charitable work will be to add to your social portfolio. You will be so anti-expertise, so anti-science that your society will crumble from within.

3- You think offensive jokes are a-ok. Listen to me, nobody makes a joke unless he, deep inside, believes in that thing. Nobody will use a racial slur unless he believes that racial slur carries a meaning. Youtuber iDubbz who's responsible for creating a horde of lewd young people thinks if he uses the n-word a lot, the word will suddenly lose all its meaning. That's not true. Common sense says when you attack infringed members of a society, those members of the society will be offended even if you say it's a 'joke'. The prevalence of Youtubers who just spray vitriol and hatred just goes to show how unfamiliar the American society is with compassion. Suicide rate is extremely high among the Asian minority for this exact reason.

When 70 million people in your country CHOOSES to vote for a maniac, there's something wrong with your society. And don't try to use my nationality to carry a point, I am well aware of the ailments of the country I live in. But that country is just that, a place I was born in. It's not my identity. But I guess a lot of people are seething right now that a filthy sngr rat is offending their dear beloved nation of FREEDOM. To them I say, get a life.

Also, before you accuse me of ""falling for state propaganda"", keep in mind that I consume almost zero Iranian media. All I do is I watch Youtube and browse Reddit whilst I work. So yeah, put that in your pipe and smoke it.

So I guess I'm putting a hard task ahead of you in order to change my view. Some common arguments I hear from Americans when I tell them how much they suck:

1- Not ALL of us are like this!

True. But would you believe it if I tell you that most Iranians don't hate America and don't shout ""Death to America"" either? But you have CHOSEN to believe that most of us do this. Even so, the Iranians who do this are extremely old, and remember the days when AMERICAN SOLDIERS R\*PED IRANIAN WOMEN. They have a reason for hating America. Stats don't lie. 70 million people voted for Trump. Even more so are teenagers who can't vote and are conditioned by their parents that Trump is the Second Coming of Jesus. Q-Anon is a thing. Yes, not even most of you are like this. But A LOT of you are like this. Enough to carry out a change.

2- B...But we're conditioned to be like this!

No. No you are NOT. Media is free in your country. All you f\*ck\*rs can f\*ck\*ng read.

3- We can't really carry any change!

Yes, yes, you can. You can simply team up and vote third party. And the fact that you haven't done so in the past 40 years when you were shown how vitriolic bipartisan politics is, just goes to show how non-compassionate you are!

Again, don't use Iran's problems as a counter-argument. I am well-aware of them. Don't try to use any of the populist arguments, and don't try to play the racism card, telling me I'm being racist against white people when I clearly mean all Americans. I equally hate all Americans, and I believe this country is the cause of many ailments in the world.

If the downfall of America comes, which hopefully will be very soon, don't ask WHY it happened. Ask yourself how you can postpone it. Be more passionate. Stop sanctioning my country. Stop spreading hatred and vitriol. Educate your people.

When you bring up the issues of Iran you're being bullies because Iran is a third world despot and people are simply powerless. American people are empowered to change their situation and not only they don't fix it, they choose to vote for people who are the worst human beings on the planet. This is just sad that America holds this much power.

So can you change my opinion with all these points I've made? I will give a delta to the every single top, or second-level comment that can prove me wrong. If fake internet points means a lot to you (which is another issue I have with Americans), then act on it. You may also stop me from beating up Americans when I see them because the way they hurt my country, they deserve it. You CAN protest Iranian sanctions, and the fact that you DON'T shows how ugly your souls are."	0	71	0.24

1. I have no intention to respond to any comments related to controversy surrounding 'zwarte piet', it's not relevant to this discussion
2. in this post I assume that you're from a country where they know Saint-Nicolas and celebrate him
3. I'll be using Sinterklaas and Saint-Nicolas interchangeably, other names are also used for Saint-Nicolas

So now for the reasons why I hold this view:

First and foremost Santa is a ripoff of Sinterklaas, I mean, it's right there in the name.  Santa is sometimes also called Saint Nicholas or Saint Nick.  This is simply incorrect as Sinterklaas is a different person than santa.  And celebrating the ripoff before the original seems just wrong.  

Now some might say that Christmas decorations have nothing to do with santa.  Hence my second reason, having those decorations up for a long time makes them loose their value, their specialness.  Having a fixed date in December when everybody puts their Christmas decorations up at the same time makes them feel more special (at least in my opinion)

So, change my view, convince me that my neighbors are not wrong for already putting their decorations up too soon."	0	27	0.38

Inspired from the recent debacle with Twitch streamer Hasan Piker...

First let me be clear, both words are racial slurs, and should be avoided as much as possible. I will be talking about these two words in terms of the general understanding of their historical usage in the US rather than etymological foundations and \*true\* origin as I don't believe that has much relevance to their contemporary use in the US.

It all comes down to cultural usage and historical context IMO. The N word was used by the oppressive majority for centuries in the US in order to demean, dehumanize, abuse, and murder an already powerless and abused social minority. Even in the years/decades/centuries that followed abolition, the N word continued to be used by white people (who remained the social and political majority) in order to justify/aid in the abhorrent maltreatment of Black Americans.

The word cracker was used by a range of people in early and contemporary America. Cracker was often used a humorous term of self-description in early middle America. As a pejorative, it was often used by enslaved blacks in reference to their white masters, and it has been theorized that the term originated as a result of the cracking sound of a whip although their are conflicting ideas about that so this point isn't all too important.

To me the difference couldn't be clearer. One is a term that was connected with one of the most horrific acts of crime in the developed world, and the other was what I would consider ""verbal self-defense"" (and it didn't aid in promoting nearly the same level of hate, torture, and systematic oppresion)"	2	95	0.52

I believe that the current salary being offered to politicians in the US is not enough to attract qualified professionals to seek office. A google search reveals that a senator in the US gets paid around $170k per year, which is a high salary compared to the average, but it is in line with senior leadership positions (Directors and VP level) in the corporate world. However, the level of responsibility that a senator has in comparison to a VP at a medium sized company is on an entirely different level, which I believe entails a higher pay level. 

Furthermore, I believe the cost of seeking office should be factored into the pay of politicians as well. Prospective candidates have to spend time and resources campaigning for the job and there is an inherent risk of not winning the election. So in the case that the candidate does successfully take office, the pay should be higher to compensate for the risks taken. 

There are a few more points I can think of but this is the gist of my position. Please let me know what you think."	0	17	0.41

Proportions should be kept very strict if you are to expect good results.  There is no possibility of fixing your mistakes once the mix or dough hits the oven.

For this reason, imprecise directions such as ""add 3 medium eggs"" make no sense. Eggs are not standardized. And what is medium to you may be very different to what is medium to me.  Result?  Messed up baking results and inability to **consistently** implement baking recipes as intended.

For this reason instead (or at least *in additions to*) the number of eggs, volume should also be given, e.g., the recipe should say:

1. Add 120 ml of eggs (approximately 3 medium eggs).

Also. If egg white and egg yolks are needed in different proportions, you can list separate measurements for those.

Anticipated objections:

A. It's too difficult 

Not really break the eggs, mix them, them measure like any other liquid that you have to measure anyway. 

Also. If BOTH volume and amount of eggs are listed you can still follow the old way, if you are OK with subpar results.

B. It's wasteful

Not really. We already accept recipes that call for ""5 yolks"" and we are not worried too much about what happens to the 5 whites.  Also, you can easily make an omlett with left over egg (just add some salt/pepper) and fry to create a nice mid-baking snack.

So what am I missing? Why are not egg measurements in volume more common/standard?

In the US media at the time Kosovo’s portrayal as victims of the Serb oppression hinged a lot on the [Račak massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra%C4%8Dak_massacre). Which has two problems:

* Even if you discard everything said by Serbia or its allies, there is conflicting evidence that doesn't establish the guilty party beyond reasonable doubt (what you'd need for a military intervention). There are mainly two factual western sources. The Finnish investigation concluded that the victims were civilians, but did not have conclusive evidence that they were killed by Serbs. On the other hand two French journalists working for different newspapers present in the area at the time reported that the village had no civilians left by the time of the battle, and the “massacre” was likely staged (this was 1999, with Putin, Xi, etc. not presidents yet, so coordinated outside manipulation of western media at the time was unlikely). Note: local civilians blamed Serbs for the massacre, but this would be the case in either “true” or “staged” version of events and so doesn’t help to tell which one is correct, at least when there are credible outside sources casting doubt on KLA version.
* Just a few months prior there was a massacre on the same scale in other direction – KLA against Serbs ([Lake Radonjić massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Radonji%C4%87_massacre)). Even if Račak one was true (there were in fact better verified massacres by Serbs in the conflict), in a conflict where both sides commit atrocities against each other [on a similar scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crimes_in_the_Kosovo_War), there is no humanitarian justification for intervention on either side.

B. The aftermath was anything but a success in humanitarian terms:

* When Serbian military withdrew after US intervention and KLA took control of Kosovo, it immediately engaged in ethnic cleansing against Serbs with a number from 150.000 to quarter million [displaced](https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/kosov2/), with minimal to no opposition from US. For a humanitarian operation to lead to ethnic cleansing on a similar scale that a conflict that caused the intervention in the first place would be a major failure. (also it should be noted that unlike many separatist conflicts, the displaced Serbs had a [longer claim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Kosovo) to Kosovo than the Albanians),
* Even though the intervention delivered Kosovo to separatists, it hasn’t been properly run ever since, and remains a borderline failed state in the middle of Europe. (something that was underreported during the Europe migrant crisis a few years ago, was that refugees from Kosovo (a country of 1.5m people) accounted for a [significant part](https://www.ft.com/content/108a8d7a-b90e-11e4-b8e6-00144feab7de) of refugees to EU, although their number was likely somewhat inflated by smaller distance compared to Syria). Arguably KLA lacked organization to take control of Kosovo without direct military support, and when it was provided control by outside force, it lacked organization to run it properly – in fact a minimally competent western government should have considered the follow up and challenges when evaluating whether to start military action in the first place (OK, so we achieve military objectives – then what?”).

C. The intervention was inconsistent with prior actions and as result weakened the rules the west was trying to use, was a major factor in alienating Russia and paved the way for Russian actions in Georgia and Ukraine.

* Just a few years before Kosovo US provided support to Croatia government against Serb separatists in a mirror scenario (Serbian Krajina). It is in fact rather hard to justify both Kosovo and Krajina within a consistent sets of principles since they largely mirrored each other, and US supported government in one case and separatists in the other (unless the principle was “oppose the Serbs”). In either case (unlike in Bosnia) the Serbs were not any more guilty of atrocities than the other side.
* During the Cold War the general principle was that you could openly support a government against separatists, but the support for separatists had to be clandestine until they gained power. US military openly fighting the local government in support of separatists was in fact highly unusual before or since.
* Russia was already more sensitive to what was happening with Serbs due to their historical ties, and US actions essentially sent a message “It doesn’t matter who the separatists are, who commits atrocities, US has the power and it therefore decides who gets support”. Which broke the barrier against openly supporting separatists and paved the way for Russia using the same approach later in Georgia and Ukraine. It also hindered any foreign diplomacy from dissuading Putin since saying that it’s wrong to do what US did before could easily come across as hypocritical.
* Kosovo crisis was the single biggest factor alienating Russia’s public opinion from the west. I was living in Russia at the time and in the period following the fall of USSR it was not uncommon for people to hold an opinion that Russian things are worse and the west knows what is right. While pro-west sentiments somewhat diminished over the course of the 90s, they were still common by late 90s, but became marginalized in the aftermath of Kosovo (also given the humanitarian failure, there was no “Americans are bastards but they get results” attitude common towards US earlier in 20th century). Post-Kosovo Russian public opinion towards the west largely ranged from neutral to hostile. Which made it much easier for Putin to shift towards an anti-West stance, considering until mid-10s high public support was a major pillar of his power.

Note: I am not justifying Putin's actions – he bears responsibility for what he does, and the West’s actions never necessitated him to act in Georgia and Ukraine. However from a practical point of view, Kosovo pushed Russia away from West at a period when it was still on the fence, and made Russia’s involvement for separatists in Georgia and Ukraine much easier to justify, at least internally. (While in 1999 people couldn’t expect the events to play as they did, the fact that going against tradition and supporting separatists openly could easily later backfire, should have been easy to foresee). Also it should be noted that Georgia and Ukraine led to a now self-perpetuating animosity between Russia and West, at a time when the West’s position with regards to China and Iran would have been significantly stronger if it didn’t have to deal with Russia as well."	4	9	0.64

Mods aren’t meant to be dictators and shouldn’t have so much power. Especially when real world movements and peoples lives could potentially be affected. 

Here would be the terms: 

Every first of the month there would be a 24 hour window to vote on each mod.
The choices would either be keep or replace.
In order to vote you must have a verified email address linked reddit account and you must have been a part of the subreddit for at least 1 month.
If a majority of users vote to replace a moderator that subreddit would be mandated to find a replacement by the end of the month or risk being shut down

This would effectively reduce the possibility of brigading while also solving the biggest issue with reddit right now - power mods.

&amp;#x200B;

Aging clearly meets this definition. Aging is the breakdown of our body as we get older, which can cause a great deal of suffering and discomfort.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve also seen some people say that aging is not a disease because it’s a natural process that all living this go through, and that it’s unavoidable. But these same problems apply to other things that we do consider diseases, such as cancer and Alzheimer’s. If everyone on earth was 100% guaranteed to get cancer or Alzheimer’s at age 80, they would still be diseases. In fact, people would probably try even harder to cure them since they would afflict all of the population, but the same can not be said of aging. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not only that, aging is almost certainly a greater evil than cancer, Alzheimer’s or any other disease on the planet. 100% of people on earth are affected by aging, and they begin to feel its effects at around 30-40, then their entire lives. No other disease on the planet affects so many people for so long, only aging does. By a certain age, no matter how health or active an individual is (or used to be), they are going to end up in a wheelchair. 

&amp;#x200B;

Aging also increases the risk of getting and dying from many of the diseases that we are so focused on curing. The risk of getting cancer, Alzheimers, and just dying in general massively increases with age. Even if we are able to cure some of these deadly diseases (which would be fantastic) it would only increase life span by a small amount. Curing cancer would only increase our lifespans by 3 years. Diseases like cancer and Alzheimers should not be our priority when aging is going to kill all of us, whether we get these diseases or not. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, some might say that aging is incurable, and that focusing on curing cancer or whatever other disease is more realistic. However, research on aging has shown otherwise. Scientists recently reversed the epigenetic age of human cells that were [60 years old back to 25 using yamanaka factors](https://www.lifespan.io/news/partial-reprogramming-rejuvenates-human-cells-by-30-years/). Other drugs and treatments like [Rapamycin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6814615/), NAD+, or [senolytics therapy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0092-9) also show promise in reducing the negative effects of aging and even reversing it. 

&amp;#x200B;

If that isn't enough for you, large companies and billionaires like Googles Calico, Bezoses Altos Labs, and many others are getting involved. These are big players, and they are not stupid. They would not be giving out funding if there was not a real chance at curing or slowing aging."	24	65	0.66

I’ve worked only in the United States, but have worked in 5 or 6 different states, East to West coast, and the brunt of that has been in Western moderately to overwhelmingly ‘progressive’ large cities.  

Things to get out of the way: I’m vaccinated, I believe the vaccine is scientifically an incredible achievement, safe, and generally everyone who can get it should get it, certainly anyone with any dangerous comorbidities like HTN, obesity, or DM.  This isn’t a discussion about vaccine efficacy.

During the pandemic, specifically the delta waves in late 2020-early 2021, the ICU units I was working on were alternating between waves of dying COVID patients, almost entirely unvaccinated, and being filled with severe end stage alcohol abuse and IV drug use patients. At one point, in a weeks time we went from entirely full of COVID patients, to 100% full of alcohol abuse and withdrawal, suicide attempts, IVDU, and end stage lung disease from smoking, generally in addition to obesity, uncontrolled diabetes, etc.  These other conditions are not new, ICU’s have been this way for decades.  My coworkers were appalled, and the opinion was often that the unvaccinated were taking up ventilators and beds.  I couldn’t help but think; *what kind of supposedly liberal worldview would look down upon the group of people being literally slaughtered by an unprecedented airborne pandemic virus as unworthy of treatment and compassion?*. This concept has bothered me for over a year now, which is why I’m here.

The premise of my position: *healthcare resources since the inception of modern healthcare have been overwhelmingly skewed towards use by people of lower socioeconomic status and poor health illiteracy, and COVID is no different.*  This isn’t rocket science, people with less resources are chronically stressed, make worse health choices, and suffer from more chronic diseases than health literate, well off people.  They spend far more time sick in ICU’s than healthy people.  Robert Sapolsky did a lot of [great work](http://www.precaution.org/lib/05/sick_of_poverty.051215.pdf) on the subject, and “Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers” is an excellent read on the subject.

Not being vaccinated is correlated with being conservative politically, but far more concretely correlated with [being uneducated](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/12/who-are-the-adults-not-vaccinated-against-covid.html) or being [poor or marginalized](https://newrepublic.com/amp/article/163319/covid-vaccine-hesitancy-denial-misinformation-poverty).  *It is still to my knowledge profoundly illiberal to mistreat and look down upon uneducated, poor people in general.  In the setting of a global pandemic and an era of high government mistrust for these communities, acceptance of this view is absolutely embarrassing.*

Common argument I’ve heard and am entertaining; *the unvaccinated simply made one unacceptable behavioral/moral choice, the loads of other chronically ill morbidly obese, long term smokers, and general abusers of their health have biological predispositions for using healthcare resources;IE not their fault.*

Well, yes and no.  Behavioral science is a fascinating and evolving discipline that I’m not well versed in, but vaccine hesitancy seems to me to be an extremely arbitrary point to draw the line between victim and villain.  When a patient is hospitalized for a suicide attempt, we’re saddened that they stopped going to therapy or taking their antidepressants, but we don’t believe they’re taking up a hospital bed, or berating them for this poor choice.  When a patient decides to stop taking their prescribed diuretics, or skip dialysis and ends up on life support, knowing full well of the consequences (this happens *astonishingly* often), we don’t look down on them for it.  We treat them.

This argument is rooted in the idea that some types of people have diagnosed diseases and are incapable of being at fault or making decisions for themselves, but the unvaccinated are not privy to that status.  *This sort of implies to me that we believe smoking addiction or food addiction has biological/social causes and being unvaccinated does not, or that those causes are less justified.* My understanding of behavioral science and human nature is that these processes are more complex and assigning agency or lack thereof in a black and and white manner doesn’t seem beneficial."	1883	769	0.74

This was his 8th victory at the Pipeline event, winning his first in 1992 30 years ago. Some may say the competition wasn’t as challenging when he had his good run of world championship victories in the beginning of his career, but he has consistently proved himself throughout to always be a threat and potential event winner. In the last decade surfing has become so fierce with aerial progression which was not really a thing when he started and he still holds his own against young 18/20 year olds. His barrel riding as proven in the final scoring two 9 point rides is phenomenal, his rail game solid and he has progressed enough with the sport to throw some airs here and there. He’s surfing against guys like John John  Florence and Gabriel Medial, champions in their own right with 5 World championships between them, who are in their mid twenties and peaking. No one else in other sports had had a career as celebrated as this, at 49 years old and 11 x world champion Kelly is the GOAT.	0	32	0.18

This has occurred for many reasons.

- Foreign Investors
- Domestic Executive Real Estate Investors
- Supply Chain Issues 
- Labor Shortage Issues
- Low Interest Rates
- Zoning Laws
- High Competition Among the Working Class
- Retail investors looking to rent properties.

The issue has become so concerning because it represents a direct threat to the middle class way of life if most people start being unable to afford homes. Most people perceive this rapid increase as a bubble that will eventually cause prices to crash so they are not worried. I disagree with the conclusions of most people. I think we are witnessing a real time transition in most western countries to a society of highly unequal standards of living.

Canada, Australia, and the UK have had high housing prices for decades at this point, the US is just catching up to other anglophone countries.

As the world becomes more destabilized due to climate change and illiberal regimes asserting their authority, more people are going to want to move to the west or park their money here, further driving up prices.

Banks want to own all the property because it becomes an incredibly stable and lucrative investment and lucrative investment to become the private entity that housing is outsourced to, rather than offer loans. You won’t buy the American dream, you’ll rent it.

Big companies are incentivized to keep property prices high because then it keeps people desperate and willing to work for wages that are low.

There’s only so much land in places like Seattle and Boston so even if we increase density it will still mean homes are expensive because the few that remain in urban areas will be highly desirable and sought out.

Politicians don’t want to solve the issue because they want to keep their investments and portfolios thicc and fat.

Those of us living in the US are not going to ever witness the conditions of the 50s - early 00s ever return because there’s too many forces at work driving it to be the opposite. If society rises up against it it will just destabilize everything as a class power struggle ensues."	3021	515	0.93

In any capacity.	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/tq30tn/cmv_affirmative_action_or_positive_discrimination/	"I'm going to argue in the context of university/college admission, because thats what I'm most familiar with, but I absolutely feel the same way for the wider world. 

I'm a white male from the UK, but I'll be talking about the US system, because the UK one functions the way I belive that affirmative action should work, but I'll get to that later. 

I simply put, do not see how any form of ""Positive discrimination"" on anything other than economic lines is anywhere close to fair for university admission. (And I don't think its fair AT ALL for the wider workforce, but thats outside the scope of my argument for now). 

My understanding of the US system is that a college is encouraged (or voluntarily chooses to, depending on state) accept ethnic minorities that wouldn't usually be accepted to supposedly narrow the social divide between the average white american and the average minority american. 

But I feel that to do so on the basis of race is rediculous. In the modern USA roughly 50% of black households are considered to be middle class or above. I understand that a larger number of black families are working class than white families, but to discriminate on the basis of their race both undermines the hard work of the black students who would achieve entrance anyways, regardless of affirmative action, and also means that invariably somebody who should be getting into that college won't be on the basis of their skintone. 

I think that, if there is to be affirmative action at all it should be purely on economic lines. I'm willing to bet that a white boy that grew up in a trailer park, barely scraping by, needs much more assistance than a black daughter of a doctor, for example. 

Thats the way it works here in the UK. To get a contextual offer in the UK (essentially affirmative action) you usually have to meet one or more of the following criteria: 

First generation student (i.e nobody in your family has been to university) 

Students from schools with low higher education progression rates 

Students from areas with low progression rates 

Students who have spent time in care 

Students who are refugees/asylum seekers. 

The exact offer varies from university to university, but those are the most common categories. While it is much more common for people from minority backgrounds to meet these criteria, it means that *almost* everyone that needs help will get it, and that *almost* nobody gets an easier ride than they deserve.

I feel that the UK system is the only fair way to do ""affirmative action"". To do so based on an innate characteristic like race or sex is just racism/sexism.

Edit: Having read most of the comments, and the papers and such linked, I've learnt just how rotten to the core the US uni system is. Frankly I think legacy slots are a blight, as are the ones coming from a prestigious school.

Its also absoloutely news to me that the US government won't cover the tuition fees of their disadvantaged students (I thought the US gov did, just at an insane intrest rate), to the point they have to rely on the fucking university giving them money in order to justify the existence of legacies."	18	191	0.63

Let's look at a few uncomfortable realities 

Women have the most value on the let's call it reproduction market when they are young, starting at 18 peeking around 23 and then going downhill from there with a soft cap at 35 where you'll probably need medical assistance to reproduce especially if you've never had kids before. 

Companies see women that want to have kids when entering their field as a liability because of the aforementioned break and many women end up never going back to work or take several years off. 

Older Men (ie. men who have time to rise in their career and make a lot of money) are attracted to younger women almost universally and many women are attracted to older established competent men. Where conversely younger men are kinda a gamble, sure get in early with the next Elon Musk and you'll do great and maybe he won't be the next elon must but atleast he'll be like a branch manager or something right? Well maybe not maybe he'll be stuck as a gas station attendant. 

Mother should devote most of their time to their children especially first the first 5ish years of their life, it's good for the kids and most mothers want this. 

With all these mind wouldn't the path of 

graduate highschool -&gt; get married to man who can afford to support you -&gt; have kids -&gt; be full time mom until your kids start school -&gt; start university -&gt; finish university -&gt; start career etc. 

Make a hell of a lot more sense? Companies aren't going to be worried about you quitting to have children since your kids are already teenagers by the time you get there, you can have kids in your biological prime to do so and you have literal decades to devote to your career and you can even do your homework while your children do theirs giving them a direct example. 

Conversely on the path we recommend women are already out of their biological prime by the time they even think about having kids with their biological clock ticking and jeopardize their career opportunities. 

The reason I want my view changed is that I don't want to believe society is this backwards from biological reality I don't want to believe our advice is actively sabotaging both women's career prospects and their potential for children.

EDIT: if you can think of a third path that's better than both of these that would also change my view"	0	113	0.35

This may be because I was raised by people who never believed in not working and just giving up. I also see giving up as a kind of dumb thing to do. I don't really see what you accomplish by just giving up. 

And about future job losses, who do you think will fill all of the empty jobs? Robots of course. Automation is good to a certain degree, but the level of automation that companies need to fill these jobs would create a scenario such as the one in Player Piano (fantastic book). In Player Piano, almost every job is automated, and most people get no fulfillment from life. I don't want to go deeper in case you wanna read it for yourself. 

I am not completely closed off to having my mind changed, I just want to better understand that idea.

While ordering books or files alphabetically can you honestly tell me you look at the symbols in front of you and think ""yes, this one with three lines should go before this one with two."" Of course not, that doesn't make any sense.

I see no good reason for E to come before F, while I have outlined many good reasons for F to come before E.

Edit: u/themcos gave me another good reason which I didn't even think about, but in retrospect I should've, which is that it makes much more sense with letter grades since E is not a letter grade. "	0	51	0.2

Predictably, the response on Reddit on other social media has been to dismiss the results of this investigation outright. But I'm not sure that's entirely warranted given that Blizzard/Activision utilized third party investigators from government organizations.

That work also has not unearthed any evidence, directly or indirectly, suggesting any attempt by any senior executive or employee to conceal information from the Board. Outside advisors, after exhaustive review, also determined the Board never intentionally ignored or attempted to downplay the instances of gender harassment that occurred and were reported.  

You can dismiss Blizzard's board since you can fall back on the ol' ""We have investigated ourselves and found ourselves to be innocent"" (which I think is generally very reductive and ignorant of the actual procedures), but when you have third party actors looking at the data and analyzing the reports, I don't see why you should just dismiss that outright aside from ideological zeal.

It seems that a large swath of the American public has this mindset of ""corporations bad"" and ""believe all complaints"" which is a bit naive, and I think they're not giving any creedence to the actual investigation in this instance.

Without information and/or evidence showing that the proclaimed independent investigators are not actually independent and have some kind of vested/financial/career/etc interest in Activision/Blizzard, I see no reason to just dismiss the results of this investigation.

With ""we"" I mean mainly people of my generation (born between 1980 and 2002) from Europe and the US (as heavily industrialized countries which are historically the biggest emitters of CO2).

In the Fridays for Future movement there is a lot of (rightful) hate towards the boomer and grandparent generation. For 30 years the dimensions of climate crisis were basically scientifically solid known facts, but people in power did not act.  
I would argue that this is not only an intergeneration conflict and that future generations will maybe even have less sympathy toward us than the boomer generation.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Overall the generations before us were socialized very different to us. With less knowledge about social responsibility. More careless toward the environment. It's very hard to really make these people KNOW about climate crisis. Knowledge was not as easily accessible in the past.
   1. global + individual carbon budget concept is fairly new
   2. real population wide knowledge about the dimensions of climate crisis can maybe be dated towards Al Gore's ""An Inconvenient Truth"" (2006). Maybe until \~2010 you could reasonably have ""doubt"" whether human caused climate crisis is real (because you were not well enough informed).
2. We live in the prime of globalization. We ARE a big part of globalization which brings many benefits to us but not necssarily the environment.
   1. At no time global travelling was as accessible and as frequently used. Most people I know have been in far more countries/continents than their parents already. Weekend city trips, 1 week Europe tours etc. are fairly new things because they are more affordable than in the past.
   2. At no time in the boomer generation international goods were as heavily consumed. Boomer and older generations bought more regional. 
   3. We live way more energy intensive than our parents and grandparents did (e.g. Netflix vs TV). We maybe waste less energy (e.g. by leaving lights on).
   4. Most of us consume fast fashion and buy a new phone every two years, buy more often furniture (IKEA) and in general consume more frequently than in the past.
   5. Even garbage is travelling internationally (to partially land in the oceans).
3. At no time in the past it was as **socially acceptable** to have a low CO2 footprint as it is today. At no time in the past it was as **easy/convenient** to have a low CO2 footprint as in the past. 
   1. Digitalization allows less traveling
   2. Many substitute products for meat, milk products, CO2 intensive energy
   3. Inland flights can often be avoided by using trains, same goes for cross-country travel. (This is probably true for boomer generation as well)
   4. Overall public transport can completely replace or heavily reduce cars in many urban areas (not sure about the US lol)
   5. Bike infrastructure is improving (not sure about the US lol)
   6. Car sharing is available and would allow us to buy less cars (we don't).
   7. Electric cars are more affordable and performant than in the past.
   8. Cars in general are not the status symbol they used to be. (Now it's smartphones and travelling.)
   9. Calculating CO2 footprints is fairly easy (we don't).
4. We CHOOSE a certain lifestyle e.g. to impress internet strangers on instagram.

  
And yes, I will do a NAZI comparison now. In Nazi-Germany maybe 10% of the Germans were super convinced nazis and basically pure evil (my grand-grand dad was probably one of these). They caused the worldwar and systematically killed millions of jews worldwide. To my knowledge less than 2% of Germans were **actively fighting** against this. Leaves many many people who KNEW and let it happen.

Already today reportedly millions of people die due to the climate crisis. And today and here we KNOW about this. And yes it is unfair that our generation has a lower carbon budget than the boomer and older generations. As it was unfair towards the 60% that did not vote for the Nazi party in 1933.

Let me be clear. I am comparing companies like Shell\* to Hitler, many other **companies** to nazi party members (/r/FuckNestle) . And our generation are the people who did not actively choose this to happen. But we also decide to shut our eyes and mouth because it is more **convenient** for us to life and think that way. 

In the history books we will be heavily judged as the people who KNEW and WATCHED and let it happen. They will not be as kind and understanding and forgiving as we are to our selves. They will not distinct us from the people that ""caused the climate crisis"". Paris agreement is quite clear and most important **feasible** and we watch our countries failing targets over and over. **Billions of people will die.** And future generations will pay an even heavier price than we already have to. 

I assume that we will fail the 1.5° target and even break the well below 2° with unpredictable consequences. Please let me know, if anything I stated as facts is inaccurate. And change my view with facts I did not mention or alternative interpretations.

&amp;#x200B;

\*Shell was to my knowledge one of the first companies who new about the coming climate crisis. They actively and willingly contributed to this basically risking human distinction. Further they actively fought against climate crisis becoming public knowledge. I do not want to downplay the genocide of million of people. The way I see it Shell (and co) killed/poisoned billion people for profit, many of these are yet to die."	0	69	0.28

To me, this seems less than ideal for the reasons below:

1) **Democracy:** Conservatives like to argue that it is undemocratic for red states who might prefer a law to be preempted by Congress. They claim that it is undemocratic for Congress to force a state that would otherwise have a particular law to not be able to pass it. However, are these states not undemocratically deciding for the blue cities within them? Missouri as a whole may be against abortion, but St. Louis is almost certainly in favor of it. Texas as a whole may be against gay marriage, but Austin is almost certainly in favor of it. Why should the push for greater representation stop at the state level? Why should we not instead authorize these municipalities to be the primary lawmakers? Red states have generally substantially limited the power of municipal governments to enact antidiscrimination ordinances. 

2) **The historical argument:** Conservatives like to point out that at the time of the founding, the states were considered to largely be independent sovereigns. That hasn't been true since the Civil War. Treating states as independent sovereigns was largely a concession made to slaveholding states to give them assurances that slavery would not be banned by a federal government. When the Confederacy seceded from the Union, they sacrificed that concession. People have treated the United States as a single political entity since at least World War II.

3) **Confusion:** There are lots of areas where state lines run through populated areas. Kansas City, Kansas and Kansas City, Missouri are separated by a state line. Various changes in laws between even two red states have made Kansas City, Missouri grow and Kansas City, Kansas shrink. If states have vastly different laws, areas like this are going to essentially become ungovernable.


To change my view, you need to show that states are better suited for the task of legislation than both federal and municipal governments. Arguments regarding the Tenth Amendment will not be persuasive as I am inquiring about what the *best* form of government is, not what is Constitutionally mandated."	2	96	0.53

I am less on the fence about supporting crypto in it's raw form, though I still believe there is potential that the ideas will feed into powerful innovation. (End of edit) 

**ORIGINAL:** When new products and ideas arrive, some people win and some people lose. I don't believe crypto will ever return to what it was worth and this dip will allow innovation for small companies.

* **Innovation Trigger:** A potential technology  breakthrough kicks things off. Early proof-of-concept stories and media  interest trigger significant publicity. Often no usable products exist  and commercial viability is unproven.
* **Peak of Inflated Expectations:** Early publicity  produces a number of success stories — often accompanied by scores of  failures. Some companies take action; many do not.
* **Trough of Disillusionment:** Interest wanes as  experiments and implementations fail to deliver. Producers of the  technology shake out or fail. Investments continue only if the surviving  providers improve their products to the satisfaction of early adopters.

Crypto doesn't need to be a replacement for gold or watching the markets. It can, is, and will be a tool.

BUT!

I don't love that I am supporting it. While I feel like it is the right thing to do for future-me, it is not healthy for our environment in the current state.

1. Part of my thinking that the deflation scenerio would be less destructive to the american way of life:

In mass hyperinflation, the people generally loose all faith in their country's currency. In mass deflation, there is still faith in the currency despite things being worth almost nothing. My grandparents memoir describes their living through the great depression and at one point they had to sell their house for 44 cents (no joke, thats what their memoir says) and went to live in the shed in the backyard. If they had lived through Weimar Germany's hyperinflation, they wouldn't have bothered with trying to sell their house (would have been impossible for them to anyways... how many wheelbarrels of reichmarks would the buyer have had to bring to buy their house?). My grandparents still had faith in the US Dollar even during the deflation of the great depression... people in Germany were litterally burning reichmarks to heat their homes. My grandparents could still at least use Us Currency to buy and sell... In weimar germany they largely resorted to bartering. The economy seems to at least somewhat still function with deflation.

2. Another part of my reasoning that deflation would be preferable is that i fear history would be more likely to repeat itself with hyperinflation:

In weimar germany, the economic collapse helped allow a certain evil man with the mustache to take advantage of how hard things were to help him seize power. He even meationed in a famous speech at one point about how it took entire wheelbarrows of reichmarks to even buy a single loaf of bread. I think that extreme hyperinflation in america could help allow history to repeat itself in a similarly horrible way allowing possibly a future oppressive regime to seize power. I cant speculate on exactly what that could look like (hitler 2.0?!), but I think that a hyperinflation sceniario could quite possibly make it much more likely. I think the american way of life could still march onward with mass deflation but with mass hyperinflation... regime change unfortunately seems more likely in the hyperinflation scenario.

3. The third part of my thinking is that hyperinflation would be overall more destructive to the US economy:

In the deflation scenario everything loses most of its value (which is worse for sellers than buyers) but in the hyperinflation scenario everything costs too much for anyone to be able to purchase anything at all (which is extremely bad for both buyers and sellers). Both collapse scenerios seem like they'd be very bad for the economy but to me the deflation scenerio seems like it would be at least somewhat less bad overall.

Also, i recognize that there are people on both sides of this, on which scenario would be worse. It may or may not undermine my view a little bit but: some would argue that two of the hyperinflation scenarios of the past only happened because of uncommon circumstances. Some argue that weimar germany was only in its incredibly precarious/unusual economic position because its administration's predesessors had tried to take over the world in WW1. And in the case of zimbabwe: some say that their uncommon situation only occured (and is still somewhat occuring) because they were hit as a country by a reasource shock. But then again couldn't this country conceivably be hit by a reasource shock and thereby throw us into hyperinflation?

Hard to predict the future sometimes and i suppose it is best for us to hope as a nation that neither of these situations happen anytime soon."	4	27	0.63

These external senses of validation are a short term fix to something that will effect you long term, similar to cheating on a test and then not being able to finish tasks in a workplace, or using drugs to fix a mental illness.

Are humans just social creatures and as such should depend on others for worth? If so, why do all the greatest artists create work for themselves not others? The contrary to this is making pop art, and if you think pop art is good I don't know what to tell you."	0	52	0.39

On Instagram and Facebook themselves, it doesn’t seem like he ever broke any community guidelines directly. 

A lot of comments are saying that he is a trafficker/abuser/rapist but I can’t seem to find any proof of any convictions anywhere.  If we ostracized and banned every person with an accusation against them- there wouldn’t be many people left. It also seems a lot of those claims were unfounded.

I agree that a lot of his content can be seen as misogynistic, but not to the extent to warrant a ban imo.

All in all, as someone who has not followed this man past whatever the algorithm shows me, I am failing to see why he got banned and why people are rejoicing in it. CMV!

Edit: I gave a delta to someone who provided an article that expounded on his misogyny. The other criminal accusations that people are touting have yet to be cited and backed up.

I'm talking about places like incels.co, the /pol/ board and to a lesser extent the red pill community.

Most moderate incels (from what I've lurked) lean on the conservative or lib-right side, but the ones who make lunatic posts on 4chan are obviously alt-right extremists. The latter probably need psychiatric help, so here I'm going to focus on the moderate incels.

I believe moderate incels are those who have adopted incel vocabulary and are using demeaning words to consider themselves above women. However, the moderate incels do have some legitimate complaints, such as the lack of father figures, the mainstream media's bias towards progressive viewpoints, and the general lack of emotional support towards men. 

Currently, influent media, celebrities, academia and many young people (especially women) tend towards progressive values on the left. Incels feel like this is a massive threat to their existence as people, as they find it difficult to maintain meaningful relationships in the real world, have daddy issues and cannot seem to be able to open up about their problems because of the fear they will be judged. 

These young men being so hateful is merely a consequence. I've mentioned in previous CMVs that men's movements have all went to shit. The lack of a positive such movement, that does not blame feminism, China or other external factors, was a major factor contributing to the rise of the incel mentality as we know it.

The fact that the incel community was started by a woman who just wanted to help and had a very positive support group in the beginning seemed awesome. But... ( and this is not the only time, happened to MRA as well) the community got toxic, and once she left it became a massive hellhole wasteland.

I'm wondering what causes the turn of initially positive men's movements towards the alt-right. Sure, you can try to heavily moderate them (but, from what I've noticed, such communities are insignificant in terms of reach, like r/menslib), but I'm wondering if this is because society as a whole still believes that men cannot have issues, that when they open up they are being told to man up, and the men's movements failing to send positive messages to the mainstream.

You cannot stop the incel mentality and the male identity crisis by just banning their communities. You're honestly just delaying the inevitable and I believe you really need to start talking. The incel community and the feminists need to have representatives capable of constructive criticism, that do not resort to sweeping statements. A moderator definitely needs to be present as well.

I'm thinking about the whole Poland elections back in 1989 between the communist party and the ""S"" opposition. The government banned ""S"" for eight years before finally allowing them back and starting to negociate. The same can be done here. I believe that only talk and openness from both parties can be done."	0	130	0.44

Raceswapping has been growing a lot lately and the most recent ones I’ve seen include the Last of Us series, Little Mermaid, and Velma. The way I see it is people have been asking for diversity and representation for a long time (and that’s a good thing) and now the media is not only taking advantage of that, they are not really listening. 

To me, it’s nothing more than slapping a POC onto a known character in a blatant cash grab from POC consumers. I feel the same way about changing pre-established characters sexualities and genders. If these media companies really cared about representation, would they not put their hearts into making an original amazing character that is a POC or LGBTQ+?

Are Joel and Ellie the only survivors in the apocalypse? Is the Little Mermaid the only mermaid in the sea? Is mystery inc the only crime fighting/ghost hunters they can come up with? They didn’t make Peter Venkman black, they introduced Winston Zeddemore and he’s the best! Lee Everett is one of the best video game protagonists made and he’s not Rick Grimes. Raceswapping is not how you handle diversity. This is how you make easy money from using known and loved characters to keep people intrigued before making unnecessary changes. People have been told it’s racist or homophobic to not support these changes and the media is milking it. 

I’ve heard people ask “why do you care? It’s a cartoon/video game etc?” I could ask the same about these creators. Why do they care? Why change the race or sexuality of a character people already know? Why raceswap the white characters in the last of us and not the POC? What is the point? It becomes confusing but it seems pretty obvious. I have no problems and encourage diversity and representation when done right and respectfully. But all I’ve taken from these recent changes is they know how to pander and milk money from it. 

I read a comment earlier today, “Well Velma was Hispanic in Scoob (2020) and now she’s Indian? That’s offensive to the Hispanic community.” Confusion. There is no reason for this other than money and now what should be a love for diversity is simply turning into more hate and separation. To me it’s insane so many people are falling for it and going along with it but maybe I am thinking all wrong. I think they could do better and originality goes a long way, especially nowadays.

Now I don't value posting in ChurchOfCOVID a whole lot, so I deleted my comments containing the arguments and sources. Looking at how that scales, the only people that will keep interacting with that subreddit are people who value their access to that subreddit more than me. This left me with the impression that this policy might discourage  people with dissenting pro-vaccine messages more than people who will keep the echo chamber alive (and who might be dependent on the sense of community). In my case it made me remove scientific evidence that vaccines work, which I don't want to happen more often.

Note that I'm not arguing that the benefits of this are not worth the cost, even though I'm not convinced of that either.

I am strictly stating that the costs of this policy are significant, and might even be counterproductive in some aspects.

I don’t think people put enough consideration into the fact that when you’re sentenced to death, that’s it. You’re done, forever. With life in prison you can still work on yourself, and build your body and health with exercise. You can read books and learn new things, expanding your knowledge on all subjects of life. You can keep limited contact with your loved ones for years to come, find out how they are growing, living, and what they’ve accomplished. You can still observe the world, watch the sunset and observe nature. (Obviously in a limited setting and time). But with the death sentence, it’s over. You’re dead.

It would seem that there is a massive majority of people that consider specific names to be wrong, even to the point that a parent would be accused of incompetence or abusing children (most often the first) for following through with naming their child something specific in the most extreme cases. Given, much of this may be an attempt at humor (I tend to have a hard time detecting that), so I looked more deeply into it.

This sentiment is often expressed when one is presented with a name that is clearly based on some object or concept, an example of which can be seen [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/The10thDentist/comments/zc1jq4/miracle_baby_names_are_so_bad/). Unfortunately, this is a bad example for measuring the popularity of the sentiment since the subreddit's rules make downvotes indicative of disagreement, and I don't have access to vote percentages for the post (Reddit stops all ""post"" vote count displays at 0 even if the actual score is far lower), but I bring it up because it shows part of the arguments that someone might make concerning this topic and I will be using it later on.

A much better example is [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/zfcilf/will_my_daughter_hate_me_if_i_name_her_california/), a popular post about a specific instance of naming a child based on an existing concept in which almost 2K comments unanimously agree that doing such is a bad idea (even if you sort by controversial and pick out specifically the most downvoted comments, they're usually like that because they take the sentiment to the extreme, but never because they actually think it's a good name). This subreddit is known for having a variety of different demographics asking and answering questions, so the opinion seems universal if it would see so much expression in large volumes from so many users.

Further examples can be found at r/NameNerdCirclejerk, a community dedicated to this type of opinion.

There's also the fact that people are now reluctant to give (or at least express disapproval for giving) people names that have been used for ridicule or associated with negative figures, such as ""Karen,"" ""Adce,"" and ""Adolf."" Then there's the general disdain for alternative spellings that can be shown in some instances. This further cements the idea that there seems to be a consensus that certain names that would otherwise be reasonable should be judged as ""off-limits.""

I was given a name that is often mispronounced at first by people who don't know me (but easily learnable) to the point that I just use my last name at most restaurants where a name would be required. I have a sibling that has a name that could be targeted for jokes and another one that has a middle name that was blatantly ripped from Star Wars. Despite this, I have never once seen them express resentment for these facts, and I certainly don't hate my own name either. Given, they are still relatively young, but not so much so that I believe the point is irrelevant. I simply don't believe these properties of naming truly matter.

I figured that I should try and fix this viewpoint if it is flawed.

# Overview

It seems that the most common arguments for this sentiment are:

* It's a lazy or egotistical naming convention
* It will be made fun of
* It deprives your child of a distinct identity, forever associating them with the concept they were named after.
* In the specific case of naming a child ""California,"" it's associated with things that are considered negative (apparently porn and strippers? This could very well just be a joke).

My own take is that names should be viewed from a functional standpoint; that is, they should:

* Be both easily pronounceable and intuitively spellable (or at least be easy to adapt into making these things intuitive) so that it is not a burden to those trying to reference you by name.
* Be unique enough that it is not likely to conflict with other people your child is expected to interact with, as these situations introduce ambiguity.
   * If you would like to choose a common name, using an unconventional spelling may be a good way of subverting the ambiguity problem, but this solution should be executed with respect to the pronounceability and spellibility requirements.
* Be distinct from other nouns and pronouns that may be used in the same contexts as a name.
   * For example, ""Virginia"" is fine since context can tell you if you're talking about the state or the person, but ""Eye"" is not since it conflicts with the personal pronoun ""I"" and may become ambiguous when describing events in the past tense (The difference between ""I went to the store"" vs. ""Eye went to the store"" is not clear when pronounced).

This is because a name is merely a label for a person. It's an entirely arbitrary set of sounds that happens to fit these requirements so that it can be practical. Many names were initially created with meaning, but in the modern age, no consideration goes into those definitions when deciding on naming a child, and I think it should stay that way.

The subjective associations that the name brings about are not inherent properties of the people they are assigned to, and we really need to address the behavior that seems to imply that they are instead of designing our conventions to avoid these assumptions.

The rest of this post will be framed as counterarguments for the aforementioned most common expressions.

# Lazy or Selfish

The implication that something as simple as giving someone a name could be egotistical is not one that I have considered before seeing it expressed. It seems to be primarily based on assumption to me.

The [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/The10thDentist/comments/zc1jq4/miracle_baby_names_are_so_bad/) I mentioned on r/The10thDentist states that someone would have to tell a story every time they introduce themselves. Having met some of these people, I think this is an exaggeration. It assumes that these names are strange enough that people would immediately wonder, which was not the case for me, at least.

Of course, I can't speak for others, but even if it is something that is common to ask, I would disagree with the assertion that this is necessarily bad. On the contrary, having something interesting about yourself so immediately available sounds like a blessing to me (though I am not neurotypical, so that may be a factor). It can help you with icebreakers and first impressions.

Additionally, the post frames these names as always being given in the context of some story when it could just as well be chosen because the parents like the sound of it or that the name is associated with something else that has meaning to them.

Still, if we assume that this element of one's name is something that exists to the extent said and that a person resents said element, implying some vice on the parent's part based on so little context is presumptuous and judgemental.

Of course, there are other proposed elements of harm associated with these types of names, such as...

# Target for Teasing

This claim is what I believe to be the strongest of these arguments. The basic premise is that some names are easy targets for bullying since they can easily lend themselves to wordplay. However, not all wordplay is done with malicious intent. A person can laugh at their own name just as much as anyone else can if they know it isn't indicative of their actual qualities.

In addition, bullying is inevitable, and most people will find even the most innocuous traits to make fun of if they want to. This behavior needs to be addressed not by avoiding the triggers but by informing the masses and cutting off these tendencies at their roots.

As I previously mentioned, one of my siblings has a name that could easily be lent to teasing, but I see no evidence that this actually happens at a significant frequency. Instead, it seems that the people around him are simply considerate enough not to make that connection, or, if they do, it's a common joke among them and not a point of bullying.

But what about something that is less dependent on human behavior and more connected to our lingual environment?

# No Distinct Identity/Negative Associations

It's reasonable to say that someone named ""Ruby"" or ""Rose"" will always be associated with rubies and roses respectively, even in an indirect way. It's just a side effect of the fact that they share names with an object. Additionally, someone named ""Adolf"" could conceivably be connected to the holocaust.

However, is it justified to say that these lingual connections necessarily affect one's inherent identity enough that they should be avoided? Perhaps in the case of ""Adolf,"" since that is deeply ingrained into society and the associations would be challenging to unlink, but we still need to recognize how this is not inherent to the name but the meaning that we give it as humans. There should at least be an effort to acknowledge and address this problem.

I see no reason to believe a name deprives people of a distinct identity as if what you are called was the only factor in determining how one views themselves. It's overly restrictive to shame the use of these names.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, while it is common for people to express strong opinions about certain names being ""wrong"" or inappropriate, it is ultimately up to the parents to choose a name for their child. As long as the name is chosen with care and consideration, it can be a wonderful way to give your child a strong sense of identity and individuality. It is important to remember that what is considered a ""cool"" or popular name can change over time, and a name that is currently unpopular may become more common and accepted in the future. Additionally, a person's inherent identity is not solely defined by their name, and a person can choose to change or alter their name if they wish.

A game, for instance, might have 20 different achievements about getting certain items, and then a broader achievement for collecting all 20. This is a pointless accolade that only inflates the number of achievements in the game beyond what is a legitimate level

 The epitome of this is the achievement for completing all other achievements in the game. It can be quite frustrating to be hunting down hidden achievements, know that you have only two to go but not what they are, and then have them be awarded simultaneously for essentially the same thing. games either need to have a to of broad categorical achievements or a bunch of small individual ones, but achievements that contain only other achievements are just annoying to work through and don't even mean anything, as you will have all the constituent achievements either way.

To clarify, it is not *wrong* for achievements to contain others so long as they contain additional requirements. This is the case for progressive achievements, where you might for instance get one for collecting 2000 gold of the game and another for collecting 4000. The latter includes the former, but it also asks for more additional completion on top of it. It is impossible to earn one simply because you earn the other, so I don't consider these pointless the way the categorical achievements above are. However if an achievement doesn't require anything new beyond it's constituent achievements, than it has no reason to exist."	7	71	0.55

Because a lot of people think it was a good deal. Am I not seeing what they are seeing? I am stuck with these thoughts below. 

When you enter a country as a non-national, you therefore agree and consent to be judged by their law. If you don't think you can abide by their rules, then don't visit that country. It is complete arrogance to break another country's law because the crime you have committed is not a crime in your home country and only Westerners have the courage to do these things because they think they are privileged nationals of the world.

E.g. in some countries, men can legally have 4 wives. However, in the US, polygamy is ""punishable by a fine, imprisonment, or both, according to the law of the individual state and the circumstances of the offense."" [(says Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_polygamy_in_the_United_States)[)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_polygamy_in_the_United_States). So, if a foreign man breaks the US law and gets punished because of this and the people and the government of his country would demand that the man's punishment should be reversed OR ELSE! That would be an unreasonable request. Of course, the crime would not be reversed. *Because our laws are better than theirs. /s*

That's exactly how the US is perceived in the world, a bully. You may not like Russia. I am also a harsh critic of their government for invading Ukraine, that's a different case. Demanding Griner back was disrespectful to every single country in the world. It was a message to the world: *""Our nationals do not have to respect your laws if it's not like ours. But you can't do the same thing to us. We can do this because we are strong.""* In conclusion, I reject the general thought suggesting that ""people who have a problem with the Griner case have problems with Joe Biden and/or with black women"". I think this is a straw man fallacy. 

Also, in the future, if an unpopular US citizen is arrested because of the same reason in a foreign country and the government does nothing about it, that would not just be hypocritical, it would mean that means that popular individuals are more important than other citizens.

As an animist, I believe every living thing has a soul. The soul of a cow is not superior or better than the soul of a potato or a soybean.

Therefore, to me, I can't see how an animist could possibly come to the decision that veganism, as it stands now, could be moral. It requires you to say ""Well, both things have souls, but I'll only eat *these* things because cruelty."" But that in and of itself is cruelty.  You're saying it is entirely moral for someone to only consume X, and never moral to consume Y, when you believe that X and Y have the same spiritual essence.

You could say that eating only X means less of both die, but does that make eating only X any less discriminatory?

Note: I am not saying it is immoral in general for people to be vegan, but that for people who are animists it becomes so.

The story I have in mind is outlined here:
https://www.thedailybeast.com/hamline-university-fired-teacher-for-showing-islamic-art-depicting-muhammad

And elsewhere in various subs on Reddit.

For the purposes of the CMV, we'll talk about pictures of Jesus Christ. Putting aside religious beliefs, we'll assume (for the sake of argument) that there was, in fact , an individual who more or less corresponds to the historical -religious figure of Jesus.

*An example*

Suppose I'm an incredibly talented artist. One week, I use a photo of my brother as the basis of a drawing. When the drawing is finished, I can (logically) say the following:

1. This is a good (very good / okay  / bad) drawing. I'll call this the ""self-sense"" of the drawing. 

2. This is a good likeness of the person in the photo. I'll call this the ""other-sense"" of the drawing.

3. The key point here: This drawing is a good likeness *of my brother*. It's this last point, '3', which is absent when we talk about paintings (etc.) ""of Jesus"" or ""of the Prophet"". I'll call this the ""photo-sense,"".

*Explanation*

Suppose I now show both the drawing and the photo to an acquaintance - someone who knows nothing about my brother. That person can (logically) say '1' and '2' but not '3'. Why not 3? Because they have no comparison or reference point: they've never seen or met my brother, so they've no way of comparing the likeness or lack thereof. They cannot logically say: ""Well, you got the eyes wrong: your brother's eyes are different from how you drew them"". They've never seen my brother, so they've no way of telling if my drawing is right or wrong. 

*Applying this to pictures of Jesus/ of the Prophet*
The same applies to pictures, paintings etc of Jesus or of the Prophet. We can or could say '1' and / or '2', but not '3'. 
Suppose I now draw a picture of Jesus. Someone - anyone - can say 1 or 2 but not 3. Suppose they looked at my drawing and said, ""Well, it's good, but you've got the eyebrows wrong. Jesus had bushier eyebrows than that"". How would they know? How would *anyone* know? There's nothing to compare the drawing with.

*Implications*
If all this is correct, then ""a picture of Jesus"" is just that because (a) the artist labels it as such (the self-sense in '1' above) or (b) someone else labels it that way (the other-sense, in '2'). The photo-sense simply doesn't apply.

Note: none of this is an apology for the people who demand the sacking or punishment of the artists etc in question.  The events in the link I supplied are sheer idiocy and are an example, I guess, of gate-keeping and one group exerting their control over another. To hell with them and their ignorance, I say.

So why not make sure that political assassination by the common man against any poltician is legalized as a final safeguard with all elected and appointed governmental officals forfieting their rights for protection under the law (that also means no hiring bodyguards until you complete your term or resign) , allowing for anyone to kill them for any reason at all? 
 This would prevent the common man from being exploited as those elected officals will have to consider their policies carefully to lower their chances of death and make sure they fear for their lives while considering policy and drafting laws, allowing the individual to have a final redress if all methods that do not end with the death of a elected or appointed governmental offical fails.

Make it such that those elected and appointed governmental officals  remember this. They are our slaves whose job is to keep the government and the infrastructure running. We, the governed have the right to dispose of them in any ways possible, by hook or by crook if they displease us.

For example, I saw a post earlier about the prime minister of Italy trying to ban it. Typically the issue seems to be with how ""unnatural"" it is or the fact that it's not ""real"" meat. These arguments don't seem to hold much weight in my opinion, as being unnatural doesn't necessarily make something bad, for example, a lot of modern medicine isn't natural in the way it is used here.

Vegans have good arguments that the current methods of meat production cause massive animal suffering, which should be avoided if possible. There is also the issue of emissions. Farm animals are known to contribute a significant proportion of greenhouse gases (not most, but not a negligible amount) and lab grown meat would mostly eliminate this problem.

If the technology can progress to a level where it's equally or more affordable than ""natural"" meat, I think most people should take advantage of it, provided proper health and safety trials have been done on it. This would not only reduce the massive suffering and emissions caused by factory farming, but could make meat more affordable for everyone.

>*A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.*

Pretty succinct, right?  And that's just the problem  The right of the people to keep and bear arms has been under infringement for about 150 years, at least.  There are so many arms which are not legal any where in the U.S.:  M1A Abrams Tanks, A-10 Warthogs, Howitzer cannons, any kind of fully automatic machine gun, the list goes on and on.  

So, that means that the whole amendment does not matter, right?  We've all agreed to ignore it since the advent of weapons that are a significant force multiplier.  And such weapons did not yet exit in the pre-industrial era when the Bill of Rights was written.  So, can we all just start from scratch with laws concerning firearms?

Before leaving, I understand that some people might say, ""But, there are restrictions on speech, so should we just forget about the 1st amendment?""

To that I would say, yes, but almost all speech is still legal in the United States.  In fact, it's probably is the best country at protecting speech in the world.

The main argument is that colleges are heavily incentivized to crank out graduates and are able to continue raising tuition every year because student loans are easy to get and many 18 year olds are not mature enough to look at those financials choices from an objective and long-term perspective. It's basically taking advantage of kids that couldn't get a that loan amount for something like a house, car or business. The US government gives the colleges the power to do this because they basically guarantee loans to kids so colleges don't have to be very competitive on tuition ROI of their degrees or even the quality of their degrees. Of course there is some variance to that as it's a spectrum but still.

Edit: i forgot to add student loan debt should be able to be wiped away via bankruptcy just like any other loan. This would keep the government from taking advantage of kids who don't know or realize the reality of student debt.

Edit 2: I'd like to clarify that i believe the individual universities look at all many factors that put people at a disadvantage like family life, socioeconomic status and weight them against criteria like gpa, extracurriculars etc and make the determination of likelihood of completion by either accepting or rejecting the individuals."	95	238	0.65

What are you transitioning to? ‘Transgender’ literally means transitioning gender, however you say you identify with ‘no gender’ so how are you transGENDER? Let me just put quickly I will fight for transgender people to the ends of the earth but will never understand NonBinary and no one can convince me otherwise.  if we are going to pretend that people who claim they are  ‘non binary’ are just as brave as real trans individuals then I  simply disagree, being non binary is a choice in my belief, being Trans is not.

I agree with this, but normies clearly have an arbitrary standard for following their own maxim.

  
The qualifiers are:  
⁠Be neurotypical  
⁠Be attractive in the face  
⁠Be white  
⁠Be tall

  
Failure to meet just one of these prerequisites as a man can easily disqualify you from as much as 90% of women, as shown in many studies.

  
I have included just a few of the studies below for the lurkers. Believe me, the iceberg goes way deeper.

  
Neurodivergence:  
""Autism literally doesn't matter bro, just be yourself bro, just be confident bro, even if it means you have to be confidently autistic bro.""

  
16% of autistic men are in a relationship. 46% of autistic women are.

  
[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5789215/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5789215/)

  
Autistic people are deemed less likable and trustworthy by IQ-comparable NTs within ten seconds of meeting.

  
[https://www.nature.com/articles/srep40700#discussion](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep40700#discussion)

  
Autistic women are more likely to have been in a relationship than neurotypical men. The majority of autistic women have had sex. Meanwhile, only half of autistic men have ever held a girl's hand.

Face:  
""Stop complaining about your face bro, Danny Devito gets chicks bro, the fact that he's a celebrity multimillionaire movie star doesn't affect anything bro.""

  
A man's facial attractiveness has been shown to be the strongest predictor of any following romantic interest, whether short-term or long-term. In fact, women tend to favor certain male faces for short-term relationships and certain other male faces for long-term relationships. As a sample's face becomes more masculine, women want to have sex with the sample more.

Race:  
""Most people aren't racist bro, stop blaming your race bro, being Indian doesn't matter bro.""  
""The numbers also show that attraction isn't color-blind. To wit:-- Among males, white guys get the most frequent responses (29 percent of the time) and are least likely to respond (40 percent).-- Indian men have the worst luck, getting responses only 20 percent of the time.""

Twice as many Asian women marry interracially when compared to Asian men.

  
[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4631383/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4631383/)

  
Asian men between the ages of 25-32 have half of the relationships that white men on average do because ""a racial hierarchy explanation suggests that Asian American men will be less likely than Asian American women to be partnered, as Asian American men face gendered cultural stereotypes barring them from entry into romantic partnerships"" according to the article.

  
[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4631383/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4631383/)

  
Height:  
""Girls literally don't care about height bro, you just have to be taller than them bro, like you could be 5'1 and slay the 5'0 chicks bro.""

  
""Taller men had more reproductive opportunities (more marriages, younger second wives) and used them to have more children than shorter men.""

  
[https://www.gertstulp.com/pdf/Stulp%20et%20al%202013\_Anim%20Behav\_The%20height%20of%20choosiness.pdf](https://www.gertstulp.com/pdf/Stulp%20et%20al%202013_Anim%20Behav_The%20height%20of%20choosiness.pdf)

  
""The positive effect of height on reproductive performance was not mediated by men’s social status, i.e., their military rank, or by the measures of academic, athletic, and military talent which helped in gaining high status.""

  
[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002650100370](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002650100370)

  
A startling and sobering conclusion one can reach from all of this is that a man's face, race, and height can be worth, in the aggregate, millions of dollars to women.

  
A 5'8 average-faced Asian man would need to earn $3,696,000 of additional income over the course of a 7 year marriage to be considered as equally desirable as a 5'11.5 attractive-faced white man to a white woman.

""Just earn millions of dollars bro, anyone can be a millionaire bro.""

The data are just overwhelming, but when we point them out, we are somehow the bad actors. Normies will say all kinds of shit about us, like how we're [white supremacists and mass murderers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/14/books/review-culture-warlords-talia-lavin.html). But the data show once again that the [blackpill community tends to lean left and is comprised of almost 40% POC](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/news/incels-are-not-particularly-right-wing-or-white-but-they-are-extremely-depressed-anxious-and-lonely-according-to-new-research).

  
Bonus: ""But it's not like that in Asia bro, just be a passport bro.""

  
White men have it ten times easier in China than Asian men do.

I specifically came here to CMV because I have all the reason in the world to *not* want to believe this and have my view changed. I've had lousy luck in dating, and the main reason is because I have very specific, unique needs. I'll be using myself as an example to make my case. I'm a 34-year-old male.

The first thing about me is that I'm extremely physically affectionate. Okay, no biggie, right? Women are probably the more affectionate gender. But when I say ""extremely,"" I mean it. I will hold you, wrap my legs around you and not let go for *hours*. I'll rub and kiss and do all that romantic stuff all day long and never get tired of it. Quite the opposite-- I *need* it. This overwhelms a lot of women.

Next, gender roles. I hate them. I'm not comfortable paying for things just because I'm a man, for example. That's always the biggest one. Many women disagree with this, and I've been laughed at, insulted, and cursed out many times for it.

Now we're getting into the good stuff. Next issue is that I suck at sex. I suffer from ED that's actually strictly psychological and based solely on nerves (so ED meds aren't even really an option). I can get a rock-hard erection just sexting, but if she's in the room with me, I get in my own head and can't get hard. Women like sex, and this can be an easy deal-breaker.

Last, but definitely not least, I have a sexual kink called somnophilia. Long story short, sleeping women turn me on, and I like touching and kissing on a sleeping woman without her waking up. If she wakes up, it ruins it for me. I always get consent, but the issue is that the overwhelming majority of women I meet are light sleepers, so I can't get off, and I don't think anyone besides someone who's asexual could be in a relationship where they're not sexually satisfied.

So you wrap all of that up, put a bow on it, and that's what you get when you date me. For me to believe that, since there's ""someone for everyone,"" there's a person out there who fits ALL my needs, is available, in my area, willing/able to date me, and that I will eventually MEET this person, is, in my opinion, hilariously unlikely.

And this is with me being, without trying to sound too arrogant, tall and handsome. I don't really struggle to attract women, but *none* of them (of the hundreds of women I've at least said a mutual ""Hey how are you?"" in a dating context to) are compatible enough with me that we'd both be happy together in a relationship, and you can see why.

CMV. Please."	1	37	0.5

If they think it emotionally damages women, then by partaking they are consciously emotionally damaging women and not caring? And it's considered okay just bc men can have sex with a woman and not care about her at all?If this is true (and I'm not disagreeing that sex is probably less emotional for men)-then they are basically saying men should be allowed to use women for sexual gratification/just for their bodies because men fundamentally don't care about certain women and that's just a fact that we need to accept-so let's enable their disrespect of women and the creation of girls with emotional pain?!

My view would be changed if men with these opinions respected women openly and had happy, educated wives who they don't place restrictions on. And also, more to the point-that they don't continue to use their opinion that some women are just sex objects as a justification to cheat bc the woman they cheat with is just a body to them. How are women supposed to trust that they won't use this take to partake in cheating? Just bc they love the woman they are with and that they don't view as objects enough? Is that reliable?

It doesn't seem like he really agrees with the current Democratic Party platform and agrees much more with the current Republican Party platform. I could see an argument like ""he wants to change the Democrat's platform"", but that's not really convincing to me, even if it were true. If he generally holds opinions to what are considered right-wing today then why run as a Democrat \*today\*? Maybe he should've run as a Democrat 20/30 years ago? If he runs against, say, DeSantis, what will they even disagree on?

I think I could see myself giving a delta to anyone who could answer this specifically: What are a few policy positions that RFK agrees with Biden on, that are in contrast to what someone like Ron DeSantis believes? Otherwise, why even run against a Republican if you agree with them on everything? Also if you could provide a specific quote within the past couple of years for a handful of those positions, I'd give in if it seems strong enough.

I ask this because websites like IStandWith [list a bunch of RFK positions](https://www.isidewith.com/candidates/robert-kennedy-jr-2/policies) that just seem wrong. Like a bunch of the sources for his policy positions here are ""Democrats generally agree with this, therefore RFK also thinks this"" but not something he specifically said.

I don't think I'll have my mind changed on RFK's crank views on COVID, HIV not causing AIDs, or like Wi-Fi causing cancer, but I'm genuinely open to having my mind changed on what I asked above if you can answer that."	24	525	0.59

If you get a mediocre surgeon your face will just get butchered. Where I’m from plastic surgery is very common and there’s a lot of great surgeons so really do your research before committing. 

I don’t get why so many people have such a huge issue with plastic surgery. Why would you not make yourself look more attractive? Being good looking affects pretty much every aspect of your social life. People perceive you more positively in pretty much every way. People against surgery always leave out the obvious fact that your attractiveness has a direct impact on the attractiveness of the people you’re dating. I’m still young (20) and when I pick a partner for life I want her to be at least be good looking, not just average. I’m sure most people in my age range feel the same way.

I’m just really tired of all this wishful thinking about looks not being important, because they obviously are. Wanting to be more attractive isn’t shallow or insecure, it just means you’re realistic about how society works. It also doesn’t mean you don’t like yourself. I’m ok with my appearance, I just think I could look better

If you think you could look better and could reasonably pay for surgery (as long as it’s not a huge cost for you), you really have no reason to not do it in my opinion.

from poor training to institutional racism to lack of accountability, etc.. but what is usually missing is an acknoledgment of the role Hollywood has/had in it. 

Hollywood is full of movies where the cool cop has to bend the rules in order to save the day. It's one of the oldest and hardest to die Hollywood cliches:

A super cool/trigger happy cop that has to fight against crime but also against a burocratic system that stops him from doing what is needed (roughing up suspects or generally bend the rules), quite often we also get the classic ""badge and gun on my desk"" from his boss, until our hero is vindicated for his unortodox actions.  
Sometimes is not a cop but a CIA/FBI agent that must defeat a terrorist, there's no time for citizen rights or rule of law, being cool and good with fists is all it matters.

I'm not talking just about some quasi-fascist dirty harry or Charles Bronson movie, this kind of movies come in all shapes and forms, in fact most police/thriller movies have cops getting physical or being trigger happy or bending the rules, and they are always super likable heroes:   
Even ""culturally modern"" actors like Dwayne Johnson played that role several times, Mel Gibson, Will Smith, all the 90s action heroes, even some well known TV series have that, as well as some commedies (like Stasky and Hutch), etc...  the list is endless. 

I don't think it takes Freud to understand what a deep impact on cops view on policing that cultural cliche has.

So why isn't this seen as problematic? Hollywood has changed a lot of cliches during the years, no-one would accept nowadays a rappresentation of gay people or women like we had in some 80s movies, but somehow law inforcement outside the law is still accepted even in an age where police brutality (and it's causes) are under the spotlight.

I honestly think this is one of the main issues when it gets to police brutality and it's weird that is   
ignored by so many.

The first problem with this is that the amount of money the U.S. has sent to Ukraine is actually only a tiny percentage of GDP/federal budget, and it's for a good cause.

But the second, more pressing, problem is that even if the U.S. never sent any aid to Ukraine, and instead diverted the $70 billion in weaponry and financial aid back to America instead..........most of these Trump-wing conservatives wouldn't want that money spent on Americans either, despite their complaint. I'm talking about the Marjorie-Taylor-Greene type.

If it were spent on school lunches........Republicans have been spending a lot of effort blocking free school lunches.

If it were spent on welfare.......Republicans would complain that that's......well, welfare.

If it were spent helping the homeless...........Republicans would complain that it's helping 'stinky, dirty, lazy homeless people.'

In other words, Republicans don't actually **want** that money spent on helping people, they just want something to complain about.

Lastly, if the Biden administration indeed sent no aid to Ukraine, you can 100% guarantee that these Trump-wing Republicans would do a 180-degree and attack Biden for being ""weak,"" an ""appeaser,"" and claiming that Biden is letting Russia win."	1	628	1.0

I’m 28. When I was 13, I started having weird throat problems all the time. It felt like my throat had a lot of pressure in it, like a weird burning like feeling, and the only thing that helped was when I drank or ate something or swallowed. This would help then it would come back a bit later. I had weird issues swallowing saliva too. I saw an ear nose & throat doctor about this and was told my issue was acid reflux. I was prescribed reflux medication and told to sleep on an incline. I did those things for a while, but it didn’t help. Supposedly I was treating the issue and the doctor didn’t know why I wasn’t improving but told me to continue doing what I was doing to supposedly treat it. I saw some other doctors that weren’t sure either. I learned to just live like that but it was annoying and started to take over my life to the point that all day every day revolved around coping with my throat. I had bad anxiety because of it, used to avoid things, had to make sure I always had something to drink to help my throat, and felt really stressed about it all and how it was affecting me.  
  
When I was 15, I started to feel like a brain fog on top of the throat issues. It was like my brain felt like mush all the time. Like the feeling when you sleep bad for a couple nights and your brain feels like crap, except I was sleeping plenty. I felt kind of spaced out, couldn’t concentrate as well, never wanted to do anything, and just felt kind of crappy all the time. Wasn’t severe but was definitely impacting my day to day life, in addition to the throat stuff. I went back to seeing doctors. Lots of doctors said there was nothing wrong with me and some even said that the brain fog (and even the throat issues) were all psychological. I didn’t feel like that was it because my symptoms felt so real and physical but what did I know. I was prescribed antidepressants and doctors recommended I see a therapist for anxiety issues. I spent the next couple of years trying multiple medications, seeing therapists, and making other changes but nothing helped. I thought I was going crazy. Psychologists made me feel even worse as they further made me think that all my issues were mental. In those few years that passed, I had slowly started to feel worse. It wasn't a day to day difference but a few months or so would pass and I would feel a bit worse than I did a few months earlier. By the time I graduated high school, the constant mental fog and tiredness were affecting me pretty bad. I felt stressed and anxious nonstop, both because of how much these issues were affecting my life and I physically felt anxious all the time too. Sometimes the anxiety was so bad I would literally start sweating. I had almost no social life during high school because these health issues consumed my life and did just the minimum to get by. Because lots of doctors were telling me there was nothing physically wrong with me, I started to believe them about it being all mental. I thought it was something I was doing wrong personally. At this point I wasn’t even talking to my family about it as much since supposedly there was nothing wrong and it was all in my head. Especially when doctor after doctor were saying nothing was wrong and because my symptoms were mostly feeling tired and foggy all the time (what parents want to continually hear that), I felt guilty even saying anything about it anymore. It felt like it was a personal failure for feeling the way I did. Everyone gave me crap for seeming lazy and low energy. They gave me the impression that my issues were because of me and I just needed to change my mindset and lifestyle and I’d feel better. Changing my thinking, behavior, antidepressants, therapy. I did every single thing doctors and therapists and family told me to do, but nothing helped. They made me question my sanity every day. By the end of high school I probably had at least 10 doctors tell me there was nothing physically wrong with me. It was hell living like this.  
  
I was in no shape to go to college, but I did. I ended up going because supposedly there was nothing wrong with me and I was trying desperately to believe it was all in my head like everyone was saying. So I pushed myself to go, hoping I’d sort it out soon. I didn't. I spent the next 4 years slowly feeling worse, still seeing doctors but getting no real answers. I'd go months and months at a time without even seeing a doctor as I didn't know where to turn and had given up at times. I'd also go back to thinking maybe it's all in my head, but at the same time my symptoms felt so real and more severe than anything mental could cause. During college, I saw a doctor about sleep apnea but didn't seem to fit most of the symptoms. Things like waking up trying to get air, choking, stopping breathing, snoring, wasn't overweight, wasn't unhealthy, didn’t have a family history of it or other health issues. Doctor also did scans and didn't see anything abnormal. Still, I tried one of those moldable mouthpieces that’s supposed to help with sleep apnea but didn't see any benefit from it. So with all of this in mind, I figured it’s probably not sleep apnea. I was so desperate, I was constantly trying all sorts of medications, drugs, supplements, and other weird things to try and help myself. I felt like I was losing my damn mind. My mental health was god awful. Felt like crap 24/7. I literally felt stupid because my brain wasn’t working. Dealing with symptoms and figuring out what was wrong with me consumed my entire life. School wise, I would occasionally go to class after taking a big dose of stimulant drugs, but even those only did so much. It got to the point that no amount of caffeine pills, energy drinks did anything either. I experienced nothing enjoyable in 4 years of college and had basically no life, really no friends, hobbies, nothing. Really the only experience I had was when I went on a study abroad trip but it was terrible because I felt so awful the whole time. I had also joined a fraternity in the beginning of college but did almost nothing with them for the same reason. The mental tiredness had gotten so bad it felt like I was disconnected and living in a dream. Like I felt kind of drunk. I was so mentally and emotionally numb and exhausted I didn’t even feel human. Like I physically could not feel emotions and felt super spaced out. I was also still dealing with the throat issues. I’d get random dizziness, my vision got worse like being more sensitive to light, almost no sex drive, my voice was sounding more monotone and dead. In four years, I also spent thousands of dollars on shuttles and ubers to and from appointments (I didn't have a car at the time and lived almost 2 hours from the major city), seeing doctors that didn’t take insurance, buying supplements, drugs, etc. I somehow managed to graduate college (I could make a whole separate post about this) and finished feeling way worse than when I began.  
  
I spent the next year doing just the bare minimum to get by, feeling like a horrible zombie. About a year after college (2019), I had a sleep study done and results came back with moderate sleep apnea. 17 times an hour I was having breathing interruptions while sleeping. For the first time I actually had an answer. Sleep doctor immediately prescribed a CPAP machine. I spent about a year messing with the machine and the face mask they gave me and got no benefit. I then switched to a different machine and a mask that only went into my nose and finally noticed some improvement when I was able to keep it on and sleep through the night with it. However, this didn't happen much as it was super uncomfortable sleeping with air blowing down your throat and a mask stuck to your face. I'd also wake up a bunch during the night, rip it off without knowing, etc. But I was desperately trying to make it work. When I was able to keep it on for most the night I felt a bit better but it was really difficult to do so consistently. During this time I couldn’t really hold down a job, other than some really basic, short term jobs. And even those felt brutal. I was a complete zombie because the tiredness was so overwhelming. It was as an amount of brain fog and exhaustion I didn’t know was humanly possible. I was making myself basically sick with stimulants. Throughout all of this I was taking stuff like Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse, modafinil. I was so tired none were really helping and even had a doctor at one point tell me that I should get genetic testing for depression or have my brain zapped with electric shocks. I didn't go that route. By this point, I'd had nearly every medical test someone could have done.  
  
After 2 years of messing with machines and still struggling, my sleep doctor then recommended I see a maxillofacial doctor to see what the underlying breathing issue was being caused by. The doctor recommended I get a custom mouthpiece made that shifts the lower jaw forward to help open the airway to prevent breathing issues while sleeping. The process of having it fitted and made took a couple months. I even took a “real” job during this same time because I had two different doctors telling me that this mouthpiece was likely to help me a lot. I felt like I couldn’t have gotten the mouthpiece fast enough. I ended up messing with the mouthpiece for months and had no benefit at all. Literally zero. The dentist who made the mouthpiece said that the mouthpiece wasn’t helping because I might just have “weak muscle tone” in my throat and that I should see someone called a myofunctional doctor to supposedly improve muscle tone in the throat and tongue. I looked into that and it seemed like total quack stuff so I didn’t do it and completely dropped that dentist that made my mouthpiece and suggested this. I then saw an ear nose and throat doctor and later did a sleep endoscopy with him where I was put to sleep and had my breathing monitored with a camera down my throat. The doctor said that my breathing issues were being caused by my throat and jaw and suggested that since the mouthpiece wasn’t helping, I could get surgery or have a device called Inspire surgically inserted into my chest and neck to artificially help breathing. I held off on that cause it sounded pretty extreme and thought there had to be something else. During this time I had to leave the job I should’ve never taken in the first place because I was so non-functional.  
  
I pretty much gave up for months. I eventually scheduled an appointment with another ear nose & throat doctor (the same kind of doctor I first saw when I was 13). I'd already seen multiple ear nose & throat doctors by this point but didn't know what else to do. The connection was made that my issues were due to really abnormal nasal breathing. I had a really severe form of something called nasal valve collapse, which was causing both sides of my nose to almost completely cave in and block most air when breathing in, even when just breathing in a little bit. This issue is worse during sleep so all night I was struggling to breathe and was slowly feeling worse over time as I was never getting quality sleep. So the bad sleep every night just kept accumulating over the course of 10+ years. He also explained that my throat issues were a sign that my nose wasn’t functioning normally, which was causing airflow issues and a throat pressure feeling as a result. Nothing specific caused this issue to happen. Just the way my face and nose naturally developed over time. Doctor said this issue is not common and when it does happen is typically the result of an injury or prior surgery as opposed to it just happening naturally. Multiple doctors told me that this very rarely happens in otherwise healthy young people. Prior to having surgery the doctor had me wear a plastic dilator piece in my nose at night to prop it open which helped incredibly. Everything finally made sense for the first time ever. I even recorded my sleep and could hear myself struggling to breathe all night.  
  
Last year (2022), I had nasal reconstructive surgery as well as a septoplasty surgery. It took a long time to recover but I feel I mostly have now. I may still have to look into a revision surgery as the collapse is still fairly bad when I'm not wearing the dilator but over time most of my issues have gone away since it was the poor quality sleep that was giving me most my symptoms. The slowly worsening constant exhaustion, brain fog and cognitive issues that started when I was a teenager. The severe anxiety/depression/stress I had since I was a kid. Sleep apnea and poor quality sleep further making the body feel stressed out and anxious as a result. Throat issues completely gone. I no longer feel like killing myself out of misery, as I did every day since I was young. It was that simple but untreated made my life constant torture. Feeling horrible nonstop, slowly getting worse over the course of more than a decade, not knowing why, being told there was nothing wrong with me or that it was all psychological, trying all sorts of things with no benefit, and having my entire life be ruined was a mental hell I wouldn't wish on anyone. I don’t feel like my teenage years and a good part of my 20s actually happened because I was in such poor health physically and mentally 24/7. Every day was about just getting through the day. Life felt like it was on hold. I missed out on most ""normal"" things other people I knew were doing. I wish I had been able to see good doctors earlier, but that unfortunately didn’t happen. I’m not even sure how I wasn’t able to make the connection myself. I think I was just so used to really bad breathing since I was young that I didn’t know it wasn't normal and had no reason to think I had some weird issue. It's frustrating knowing that none of this should have even happened to begin with and that it was so preventable. Fuck every one of those medical experts that told me to my face that there was nothing wrong with me and that the very real horrible physical and mental symptoms I was having was all in my head. This shit consumed every aspect of my life 24/7. My life outside of this was complete nothing. Through all this I've learned there is nothing more important in life than proper breathing and sleep. Such basic, fundamental things the vast majority of people will fortunately never even have to think about. Hopefully this can help someone out there. Thank fucking GOD it's over.

TLDR: Slowly worsening chronic fatigue/brain fog and other symptoms for 10+ years was due to really bad nasal breathing, mostly severe nasal valve collapse that was leading to sleep apnea and unknowingly bad sleep every night and destroyed every aspect of my life."	1	7	1.0

That is to say we should see men getting primary custody, out of all the primary custody cases, to be around 50%. However, I think it's hard for me to understand because of one simple point. Most are settled outside of courts. Both parents agree the mom should have primary custody. 

When the judges sees it, i think who ever knows the child more should have primary custody. If you want primary custody during the times you should have been more involved with the kid. It should have been talked about with your partner. Ask your partner to work some if money is tight. If you still have a child and tell the mom to stay home because it's not worth her being at work, be prepared in the event of divorce she will have the primary custody. 

It just doesn't make sense to me that people who are working full time with a stay at home parent think that anything should change. If that was the arrangement prior divorce, why should the child rearing suddenly land on YOU? You didn't do 50/50 then why do it now?"	1	7	1.0

But I’m going there. They are brother and sister, the game has several things implying this very thing. Regardless of what fans or chat gpt says, they are siblings. It’s extremely obvious. Maybe they aren’t brother and sister in other games but here they are

my evidence

\*the tri force. They both have it 

\*link is clearly a royal, and the story says his mom took him out of the castle and into the forest For the tree to babysit him. zelda doesn’t have a mom. They both have blonde hair. Because they have the same mom 

\*Link doesn’t have a dad. Zelda doesn’t have a mom. Link has a mom. zelda doesn’t have a dad. Tri force ran within the king as well, it’s a royal family thing. Hence, moving link out of the castle to stop Gandorf from taking it all 

\*the great deku tree lied to link about his origins for the first 10 years of his life. He likely lied about him being related to Zelda so he could never fall into ganadorfs master plan. Getting them together so he can hijack tri force 

\*It’s not actually the great deku tree that tells link about his mom. It’s the sprout tree that comes out after he dies that does that. 

\*at the end of the game. Link and Zelda meet at the castle and don’t say a single word whatsoever. And that’s how the game ends. Because link knows they are family and can now enjoy it with ganadorf dead 

&#x200B;

i get other games might not point to this. But I’m talking ocarina of time. Not anything else. They are siblings. Brother and sister. Get over it

*I am assuming worst case climate projections for the sake of this scenario. Not super excited to respond to anything about how the upcoming climate crisis is man-made, natural, a big deal, the degree of why it’s *not a big deal,* or how it’s caused by Jewish space lasers. So I’ll at least acknowledge this as a disagreement or concern now and hope no one feels the need to bring it up. If you do… You win! I’ll pray for your fortune & favor a full fortnight.

There’s no thesis or anything here, but this is why I had the idea;

1: I got high.

2: People who live in cities produce far less greenhouse gases, require less in resources to care for (cost of infrastructure like roads, healthcare, etc.), and with a more concentrated population we can build kick ass public transit and better infrastructure.

3: We could preserve an amazing track of land that acts as a purifier, better ecological balance to humanity’s pollution and overall buffer. There would be small outposts & National Parks in Seattle, Los Angeles, Denver, Big Bend, Yellowstone, Duluth, Kansas City, and Galveston until it’s destroyed. You would allow agriculture in designated areas west of the Mississippi as well.

3B: We will probably have to abandon the South too, or at least anywhere super prone to hurricanes. Further complicating everything.

4: Logistically I realize this is difficult or almost impossible to accomplish. Moving millions of folks, many of who won’t want to move, losing access to important natural resources, the sheer cost of such an endeavor… But ultimately I think the effort would be worth it to counteract the upcoming climate crisis.

5: The American West and Southwest are going to become unsustainable to human life. At the very least it will require too many resources to be worth it. Wildfires, drought, water access, refrigeration & energy costs, and probably a few things I’m forgetting are going to contribute to this inevitable outcome.

6: As it gets warmer, Canada will become a much more important partner and most of their population is to the east too.

7: We would largely cut off our southern neighbors. And shipping from the pacific will be more challenging. This to me is the reason for greatest hesitation**. But ultimately I think the effort would be worth it to counteract the upcoming climate crisis.

**Not interested in talking the pros and cons† of our “security” at our southern border or immigration either. In this scenario we’ve revised our immigration laws to suit your views. I don’t care what your views are, keep that shit to yourself.

†It could be all pros, figure your shit out America. You’re embarrassing yourself.

That’s it. Tell me why the US shouldn’t."	1	114	1.0

Of course there are times where the victim is at no fault and no blame should be laid upon them.

There are however cases where I do not think it’s inappropriate to blame a victim for the outcome. If you are a functioning adult and you put yourself in a stupid situation that produced a horrible outcome, I think some blame should be put on you.

For example, you go out with some friends and you let one of your drunk friend drive you home. Then let’s say they have an accident, you get ejected (because you weren’t wearing a seatbelt)from the car and now you can’t walk. That sucks but you being in your current predicament is partially your fault. 

If you go on a website that’s selling OLED TVs, the new iPhone and speakers 85% cheaper than anywhere else and is offering 0% financing for 2 years… and you buy into that. When your identity is stolen, you are to blame. Yes you are a victim of a crime but blame does partially rest with you. 

In short, we don’t live in a perfect world and a reasonable person should be able to weigh the pros and cons of their actions. Oblivious stupidity should not be a reason to seek sympathy or absolve yourself of blame."	1	1	1.0

Devout Muslims and clerics all around the world just being a coward,crybaby pussy, hid behind the irrelevant, illogical wall of Islamophobia to skip from being criticised by any critic whether they're are ex Muslims, Christians apologists or atheist who professional in this field or not.

As for the critics,They never lie. Trust them. Whatever words about lslam dark,filthy truth will

This maybe sound BS but I hoped I can crush both Masjidil Haram and Masjidil Nabawi,destroy Kaabah and fill the Tomb of Prophets and Companios with dirts and faeces as the sign of revenge and humiliation that they deserve plus killed every single Muslim scholars, ustadz, ulama' and apologist out there that still defends Islam while freed Iran, Afghanistan and other opressed Muslim countries from Islamic regime and fanatics tyrannical rule.  
  
Funny, isn'it? Throw shit and corpses to the Prophet's Tomb? Maybe all ex-Muslim shenanigans will give an applause,praising me while crying in happiness.

Economics: the global gdp per capita, real or nominal, is the highest it has ever been, by a wide margin. Per capita gdp of the world currently (12,647$ in 2022) is over double that of just 2 decades ago (5,537$ in 2002). 

Inequality: inequality on a global level (i.e. the difference between rich and poor countries) has shrunk, since poorer countries had faster economic growth thanks to globalisation. Inequality is on the rise on a national level in most industrialised countries, yes, but the average income is still growing for all percentiles (see the US MEDIAN income salary, while also keeping in mind the fact that benefits constitute a higher proportion of total compensation).

Morality: many people like to claim how modern day society is less moral than the past, even though crime rates are slightly lower than that of those in the 1960s, and much lower than that of the 1990s. I’m using the US as an example for developed countries since it’s the biggest of them.
It is true that society has become more liberal, which may offend those holding conservative views on morality, but being offended that individuals are doing something that doesn’t fit their arbitrary sense of right and wrong Ian something I’m sympathetic about.

There are several reasons why it would be better, IMHO, for many people to win a smaller prize than for one person to win a huge prize:

&#x200B;

First off, at a certain point, having more money doesn't make much difference. If you win $1.5 billion, your life is ludicrously rich, just as if you won ""only"" $500 million. The extra billion makes almost no practical difference.

Secondly, by spreading out the wealth this way, many more families would benefit. If 150 families, or people, could become greatly wealthier, that would be better for society as a whole than if only one person won.

Thirdly, this increases interest and allure for the lottery. It's not as exciting to play the lottery when you hear that your chances of winning are 1 in 200 million or something like that. But if the odds were, say, ""1 in a million,"" that becomes more believable and hope-able (although still, of course, super low.)

Fourthly, this makes things safer for the lottery winner. When only one lucky guy wins the $1.5 billion Powerball, he has a bulls-eye painted on his back for the rest of his life (especially if he's in a state that does not allow anonymity.) But if 150 people each win a big prize, the fame is greatly diluted and each person gets much less attention (and hence, threat and danger.)

Fifthly, even though the Powerball has million-dollar prizes, a prize of $10 million is much more of a life-changer. A million-dollar prize alone in itself, after taxes are taken out, may not let you retire, but anyone who wins a $10 million prize (even if it's ""only"" $4 million after you take the lump sum and taxes.) You can send your kids to any vacation or grad school, go on any vacation, buy a house of almost kind of you want, retire for life, etc.

&#x200B;

So, of course, the question would be, how do you do this?

Therefore, you can take this to apply to any institution before university (i.e. secondary school, junior college etc)

The reasoning for this is

1. It promotes a sense of common identity, because you all wear the same dress, thus, you foster school camaderie.
2. In public settings, it is far easier to identify troublemakers or students playing truant wearing the school uniform, and subsequently complain to the school or relevant authorities (particularly if a crime or misdenamour has been committed) in order to *identify* them and subsequently *rectify* behavior. I admit that this can be allievated by simply changing out of the uniform, however, to some extent it does provide an addition hurdle to such behaviour.
3. Uniforms prevent, or at least alleviate, bullying and the class divide--it's far harder to bully someone for the uniform choice (while still possible) than for not wearing a branded shirt, for instance. This is made more prominent by the fact that one's shirt or pants etc is on a far more visible area and is hence a larger target for mockery. This could be extended to standardising shoe brands or banning branded shoes.

Let's talk about common arguments against uniforms and standardised clothing

1. Freedom of self expression: I should be able to wear what I like.
2. Uniforms promote conformity and dissuade invididuality(an extension of point 1)

a) You can express yourself (which is a primarily artistic decission) outside of class, in your own free time. By definition, you are in school to learn, not express your inner artistic style/thoughts/anything like that.

b)Conformity is not bad in and of itself. Let us assume that one of the primary goals of school is to prepare a student for the workplace/adult life. In adult life, you have to dress professionally at work--after a certain style, following a certain dress code. Even if you believe that this dress code is restrictive and should/will be abolished, if it *were* to be abolished, transitioning from a formal to informal dress code is far easier than the opposite.

3. School uniforms are excessively costly. Due to this cost, nepotism/favouritism can occur where school uniform

This is actually the only legitamate argument I have heard of so far. let's analyse this on two tiers

a) This cost can and should be subsidised by the educational district--it is implausible that there are no financial aid schemes to help students with the cost of uniforms, books etc.

b) It is not actually more costly to buy a school uniform, considering that 1) these clothes are likely to be worn over a long period of time--6 years for primary school, for instance--and therefore will be used to the fullest extent and 2) Assuming that there is no insane markup on school uniforms, which either the free market or governmental regulations should control for, there is no functional difference between buying a school uniform to wear to school and buying casual clothes to wear to school.

Let's talk about nepotism and profits on school uniforms

a) Again, government control and whistleblowing: if the contract was not made public to all stakeholders and fairly considered, one can report it to the school.

  
b) If the level of governmental control is so low that you can't even enforce antitrust and antimonopoly laws, ensuring market fairness, then it is unlikely that the government would have the similar amount of control to implement mandatory school uniforms.

c) School districts/cities/provinces etc can institute mass-bidding for a particular grouping of contracts to produce school uniforms, condensing it into 1 or 2 large contract biddings. Therefore, by the directive of the free market, if we accept the premise that every company will want to gain a contract (since it is profitable for them), then they will bid for it, driving prices down. If there is collusion to ensure only 1 guy (i.e. a friend/family of the mayor or whatever) gets the contract, these companies have an incentive to sue to 1) weaken rivals and 2) secure the profit.

TLDR: mandatory school uniforms pls

Only reason WW3 didn't happen was because some European countries had some backbone against the Ukrainian propaganda and called them out on it. 

With Israel there is no country that is going to call them out on their propaganda, because all the Western countries are pretty much in the pocket of Israel. Like for example, holocaust denialism has been criminalized in pretty much all European countries. There is no other historical even you aren't allowed to express skepticism about, other than the Jew-Nazi-holocaust, which tells you all you need to know about the power of the Jewish lobby in the West. 

I'm not saying the holocaust didn't happen, just that criminalizing the criticism of the official story violates free speech, which is exceptional in the European laws especially regarding historical events.  

I'm neither saying that what we have just heard from Israel about the current Hamas attack was propaganda - just that if it was propaganda and a staged false flag operation, we would never know, and hence since there is no one who is able or willing to call out Israel if they do decide to BS, Israel can just say and do what ever they want and the West will just take that as the truth, which means that if they don't win this conflict fast and easy they will say something that obligates US to get involved and then after that happens, Iran and other superpowers will get involved too and we have our WW3, and hence I think WW3 will happen inside a year from now, since the pieces are moving so fast right now in this conflict.

1. **Our population continues to rise**. Yes, birth rates are below replacement level in the US, but we are propping up population growth with immigration, and our politicians will fill the boats with as many immigrants as they possibly can before letting our economy go through what Japan is going through. A perfect example is Canada, which is taking in 1 million new immigrants a year, despite having average home prices of $716,000 CAD, and only building a fraction of the needed new housing for them. In other words, Canada is completely comfortable with creating and aggravating their housing crisis, so long as it means their economy remains strong. And the US cares about its economy even more than Canada does.
2. **We are barely building any new housing.** Whether it be overly restrictive zoning laws, nimbys shutting down new housing developments in their neighborhoods, builders heavily incentivized to stick to luxury homes, etc., the fact is that we are building a fraction of the homes needed to meet our population growth, which again, will be forced upon us whether birth rates go up or not.
3. The federal reserve is **unable to effectively avoid this**. They have raised interest rates such that mortgage rates are now at 8%, vs 3% less than 2 years ago. This has only frozen home prices, not caused a substantial drop, because sellers a. refuse to sell their homes into unfavorable markets (hence historically low inventory right now), and b. because they refuse to give up their 2% mortgage rates. So the federal reserve can freeze home values, but they cannot crater them without triggering a massive recession, something they won't do.

The anus, a part of the human body often deemed dirty, is posited to be intended to be enjoyed in its unadulterated, natural condition. In the past, humans relied on river water without the abundance of chemical products like body wash, shampoo, and conditioner. Despite these limited resources, historical humans successfully reproduced without resorting to concealing themselves behind artificially scented substances. This prompts the question: why the contemporary inclination to use such products? Perhaps the enjoyment of this particular body part in its natural state could be seen as more logical. Analogous to individuals who appreciate the natural scent of a vagina rather than an artificial fragrance, a similar approach might be taken for the anus.

Exploring this involves delving into the historical context of hygiene practices and the evolution of societal attitudes towards bodily functions. In ancient times, reliance on natural water sources was out of necessity, and the lack of advanced personal care products did not hinder the basic functions of reproduction or overall health. The argument extends to the premise that modern reliance on chemical-laden products represents a departure from our natural state, suggesting a societal shift in perceptions of cleanliness and acceptability.

Moreover, it can be argued that the current obsession with scented hygiene products is a result of societal pressures and marketing influences. Advertisements often portray the use of such products as essential for personal well-being and social acceptance. This, in turn, may contribute to a perceived need for individuals to mask their natural scents, including those associated with the anus. The argument then raises questions about the authenticity of these preferences and the societal constructs that shape them.

In examining the historical and cultural aspects of hygiene practices, one must also consider the diversity of perspectives on cleanliness and what is deemed acceptable. Different cultures throughout history have had varying standards of hygiene, with some emphasizing natural bodily processes over the use of chemical products. This cultural relativism challenges the universality of contemporary hygiene norms and encourages a reconsideration of what is truly necessary for maintaining health and well-being.

The discussion on the natural state of the anus and the human body as a whole can be expanded to include the broader discourse on body positivity. Embracing one's natural features, scents, and bodily functions challenges societal norms and fosters a more inclusive and accepting environment. Advocates for natural hygiene argue that accepting and appreciating our bodies as they are can lead to a more genuine and liberated sense of self.

 the argument against the use of scented hygiene products for the anus stems from a perspective that values the natural state of the human body. This viewpoint draws on historical practices, questions societal influences, and promotes body positivity and acceptance. By delving into the intricacies of hygiene norms, cultural diversity, and personal preferences, we can gain a deeper understanding of the evolving relationship between humans and their bodies."	1	43	0.14

""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.""

This clearly states that the intention is to allow militias. Here are the definitions of militia

* a military force that is raised from the civil population to supplement a regular army in an emergency.


*  a military force that engages in rebel or terrorist activities in opposition to a regular army.

Clearly, a militia is  a warfighting force that exist outside of government control. I believe the intention is to allow strong fighting forces to deter government overreach but that is not something I can prove with the text

The 2nd amendment says quite clearly that it is here to protect militias. For this reason, I think nongovernment fighting forces should be allowed to obtain heavy weapons such as full power machineguns, mortars, and anti-tank missiles. Obviously this would only apply to a WELL REGULATED militia (as the text states), rather than allowing random crazies or mass shooters to obtain heavy weapons

On the flipside, I see no reason why pistols or concealed carry should be protected by the second amendment. While pistols are in some cases used as sidearms in the military, they are not important or essential to a military fighting force. Concealed carry is most certainly NOT anything pertaining to militias or warfighting and should 100% not be covered

Arguments that will not change my mind:


> Some judge said this one interpretation is what the amendment means

I care what the constitutions says, not what some judge or lawyer said

> I need pistols to protect myself

OK, but that does not fall within the scope of the 2nd amendment

> I hate the 2nd amendment we need to ban all guns

So if we’re talking about a casual sexual relationship I don’t think anyone is able to argue that it is easier for women. But I would argue that it’s easier for women to find a satisfying partner too. Why? Well it’s simple, is it easier to find an ace in a full deck of cards or find an ace hidden in the woods somewhere where? I would say the former.

As for dating (and I guess casual sex), men are the ones that are courting. Men are the ones approaching women, asking for numbers, buying drinks, driving conversations, trying to impress. For us, it’s a job interview. Men are the ones risking rejection, risking humiliation, risking looking like a creep because they accidentally set of some red flag in the woman’s eyes because they were a little awkward or whatever. For us it’s conversational chess.

For women it’s as simple as saying yes or no. Women are the ones playing a more passive role in dating, so they don’t have to do much other than exist in a location where there are men. For most women, a man that likes them is easily replaceable. At similar levels of attractiveness, any woman gets more attention from the opposite sex than vice versa. 

It also doesn’t help that women have a much higher criteria for what is passable for men. Women rate the majority of men as being ugly and only find the top 10% to 20% to be attractive. So that means 80% of men are not going to have casual sex. Maybe that 80% can date after women get out of the phase when they want to be with men they’re attracted to, but that means spending your late teen and 20s alone while most women can get sex of relationship if they want.

Men are attracted to more women and have a much lower standard of what women should bring to the table for a relationship. Women aren’t exactly replaceable for 80% of men, there’s a reason why most marriages and relationships are ended by women. Men want to hold on and fix things. Women can find a new man with the snap of her fingers."	1	290	0.42

However, people don’t understand this line of thinking. Too many people are idealists who believe that everyone supports tolerance or can support tolerance. However, such an idea is easily refuted. For example, there are LGBTQ+ individuals that support the Palestinian side of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, when the majority of Palestinians believe that homosexuals should be put to death, whether it be by stoning, beheading, being shoved off a roof, etc. Israel’s LGBTQ+ rights record, though not perfect, is much better; Tel Aviv’s annual Pride parade is among the largest in the world. You at least wouldn’t be stoned, beheaded, dismembered, raped, and cannibalized in Israel for being gay (most likely). However, too many people are idealists and think that tolerance is always a good thing. To a rational person, however, tolerating someone that wants you dead is preposterous. Sometimes, it is right to say “kill them before they kill us.” This world is a cruel place.

I, for one, do not show humanity towards those undeserving of it. If you want to kill me or someone close to me, then your head will roll. You deserve no sympathy, even from a saint. If your sole purpose in life is to shed blood, then you will bathe in your own blood. As they say, those who live by the sword die by the sword. If the only language you speak is violence, then violence is the only answer you’ll receive. I wish people thought like this. Even if you don’t want to take a life, there may come a time when it is necessary. Even if you want to love everyone else on this rock, sometimes, that love is unrequited. Thus, to believe that humans deserve humanity will inevitably threaten humanity, as it means that one treats human devils in the same way that one treats a saint. Good cannot triumph over evil if evil is allowed to triumph over good."	1	71	0.35

When I say we censor something, I’m not saying we shouldn’t censor it.

We’re reaching an age of the internet where free speech is being limited, so we might as well limit stupid people as well.

We censor people for their politics, for bigotry, for directly insulting people. Even this subreddit and many others have a rule against insulting people.

With all these limits in place though, people are still allowed to say extremely stupid things on the internet. I personally think we should start outlawing it.

What pushed me over the edge is I just had an argument with someone that believed PCs didn’t have wireless internet connection. He believed they only had Ethernet (and didn’t know the word for Ethernet), and would ask me if I’ve ever used a “real PC,” suggesting a real PC only had wired connection(???).

Such a person surely deserves a timeout so they can think about their actions and maybe research something before commenting."	1	112	0.15

I personally believe so.	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18sgcf6/cmv_is_there_a_financial_incentive_from_welfare/	"Basically I was told there's no financial incentive to stay a single parent because they can either find a partner who will work and add income to the family or find another partner on welfare which will again add income to the family. Its kind of difficult to find specific numbers so I was curious if anyone here knew if two partners on welfare/one partner welfare one working will always outweigh the financials of a single parent on welfare?

Personally, I am under the impression you get the most money from welfare if you are a single parent and any type of serious relationship you get into jeopardizes that (unless you find someone whose very financially stable but let's assume thats the outlier for this situation). I also made the argument that once you do find a partner with welfare/low income, they are more likely to gatekeep their money for themselves than spend it to properly raise the kid, especially if it's not even theirs. 

Also would just like to clarify I'm not trying to generalize or put down people that are struggling, the debate is more so whether is it more or less common for single parents to be in a situation where becoming a two parent household will hurt them financially due to them losing those welfare benefits."	1	18	0.41

Becoming a teacher was once a career path I considered taking until I learned more about the incredible stress they are under. Although I support public education I can't help but foresee a bleak future when analyzing the issues plaguing it.

Recruiting and retaining teachers is becoming more difficult with the number of new teacher openings outpacing the number of new hires to the profession. This discrepancy can be explained mostly by teachers quitting the profession over other explanations.

In February of this year a report was released by a task force created by Texas Governor Greg Abbot's administration that investigated the teacher shortage. Among their recommendations was higher teacher compensation, better healthcare plans, better training, and better working conditions.

Source: Pages 4-6, [https://tea.texas.gov/texas-schools/health-safety-discipline/tvtf-final-report.pdf](https://tea.texas.gov/texas-schools/health-safety-discipline/tvtf-final-report.pdf)

However, most of these recommendations have yet to be implemented with several bills addressing the problems having been shot down (HB 1548, HB 4586, HB 2938). Also, 1/3rd of Texas teachers hired in the last year are completely uncertified; a dramatic increase from before the pandemic.

Despite all this, I believe all of these issues can be fixed through a combination of legislation and increased support for public education. What makes me so pessimistic about the subject is how demonized public education has become among far-right politicians and their supporters.

The ""culture war"" has taken over a large portion of the conversation around public schools with little sign of stopping because, in my opinion, getting parents fired up about LGBTQ topics and Critical Race Theory is an easy way to get votes. This has resulted in Florida Governor Ron Desantis's ""Don't Say Gay"" bill and a wave of harassment towards teachers and principals.

Rather than trying to fix these issues, it seems the political powers that be are more attracted to stop-gap solutions to appease the obnoxious crowds ranting about conspiracy theories instead of supporting public schools. In September my home state of North Carolina authorized the creation of a publicly funded school voucher program that would enable families to put their children in the private school of their choice; the tenth state to do so.

I'm somewhat confused at the AI hate that I see on various subreddits. In my mind, AI will be a powerful tool that already helps us in our daily lives and has the potential to offer new tools to people who previously didn't have them available. I understand that people are afraid of losing jobs, but, to me, that's a non-issue since that has been occuring since dawn of innovation. I understand the complaints about the training method, but our brains are trained exactly the same way, just less efficiently. I'm sure the scribes were pretty upset when the printing press came along, but look at the impact that had on the world.	46	147	0.66

While it could be, there’s no reason why we should assume this. If anything, it’s incel-ish to assume that any short guy can just “overcome” their height and find a partner. Some people will just likely never find partners in life. That’s the reality. We know that women very often refuse to date men shorter than them, which is their right, but that’s also the reason short men can’t find dates, not because of their “personality.”

I also agree that short men should do the things that we tell everyone to do, such as going out, being social, and just generally being a fun person to be around. But it’s not like they’ll get dates because of it; rather it’s for their own self enrichment and because being a fun person is a good thing whether you can find that person or not. 

The one “tip” I think is acceptable is that if you’re at the taller end of the height range in the OP, then it’s reasonable to maybe ask someone to consider moving to an area with shorter women within their country. Outside of that, let’s try to stop gaslighting short men into thinking their dating problems are their fault and accept that it is simply a result of standing eye to eye with the likes of Bruno Mars, Kevin Hart, and in more extreme cases Danny DeVito."	0	3	0.33

If we view it as ""any egg"", then its easy, ""stuff before chicken laid eggs, thus eggs predate chickens"", but if you specify ""the chicken or the chicken egg"", then the answer remains the same.

Wherever you draw the line between Chicken and ""Animal that chickens evolved from"" does not matter, because wherever you draw the line, that predecessor will lay an egg that the first chicken will be born from. And thus ""chicken egg"" will have predated chickens."	114	209	0.8

 What I'm proposing is that logic and facts should be above all. If I hold a belief and I have the proof to back it, I shouldn't be shoved into a group that has nothing to do with me just because that belief belongs to that group. That's because this belief isn't a belief, but a fact we all should accept

&#x200B;

In todays time, you're either white or black: liberal or conservative, and both have specific traits and if you inherent ANY of these traits you're automatically one of either.

 lets identify the current state of the two tribes, and here are some status quo traits that either tribe identity's with, regardless of my opinion on either.

the classic ""liberal"" : supports climate change, thinks women shou is ""logical""("""" because i dont think logic is dependant on the tribe you're in), supports being gay, atheist/spiritual/not really religious, loves vaccines.

the classic ""conservative"" : hyper religious, ""mysoginst"" (or just has ANY opinion on the treatment of women), likes cars, likes freedom, cares a lot about money, ""illogical"", hates vaccines and masks

why  this is dumb:

1.none of these traits from one side have much in common  , nor do they have contradicting traits from the other side.  They just got clumped together from different historical events where the tribe strongly supported either opinion, despite it not being fitting today. 

&#x200B;

2.this splits people into 2 heterogenous tribes for no reason, and diminishes logic                           


 for **EXAMPLE**: one can be gay, not religious, and not support abortions. Why? he logically concludes that having consensual sex were one is aware of high possibility of conceving is already agreeing to a baby, and the person must be accountable for there actions, rather than aborting as an escape.  


of course, this doesn't exist because it contradicts his liberal identity. his friends and family put the tribe above logic, and despite applying logic, thus man betrays his tribe by holding this logical opinion and therefore he doesn't.  

another **example**: supporting climate change as a conservative despite being 1000% factual is considered liberal.

The unemployment rate in the US was 3.7 % in Dec 2023. The tech sector (""Information"") is below that at 3.1 %. The unemployment rate was lower in December 2022 with 2.4 % so it would be true to say that the situation has worsened. But that is not what is alleged - online forums are full of people claiming that they fail to find jobs due to strong competition, implying that there's some broader issue with the labor market.

Unfortunately, these people would probably struggle in 2022 too. My guess is that people who complain online are only applying to highly competitive environments like the entertainment industry which will always be difficult to get into even during labor shortages. If you're a qualified individual, you are very likely to find a job in tech. The latest big name layoffs are skewing people's perception. The US is working at full capacity, possibly beyond it."	1	33	0.42
