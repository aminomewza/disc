4594374	AskReddit	22859687	https://www.reddit.com//r/AskReddit/comments/dlynb/how_can_we_make_football_less_sucky/	2010-10-02 18:16:45		para_sight	How can we make football less sucky?	https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dlynb/how_can_we_make_football_less_sucky/	"To make football more dynamic, fast paced and sporting, I think they ought to do at least the following four things:

No more on-field coaching.  The coach has all week to prep the players.  Once the whistle goes on Sat./Sun., the players should be on their own.  Get all those people off the sidelines, put the coaches in a box and have them only come onto the field at quarter, half and three-quarter time. 

The same 11 guys ought to play the whole game, both offence and defence.  Two, maybe three substitutions max, in case of injury or exhaustion.  The idea that you have a guy who comes on for a single kick (or to return a single kick) is just ridiculous.

No time-outs.  We already have time outs; they’re called quarter time, half time and three quarter time.  The rest of the game, you take your chances.  The idea that when the momentum of the game swings against you, you can arrest it by temporarily stopping the game is absurd.  If you get rid of on-field coaching (see no.1), this one pretty much takes care of itself.

No reviews.  None, zip, zilch, nada.  Accept the referee’s decision and get on with the game.  There will be bad calls; referees are human. Sometimes it will go against you, but an equal number of times it will go for you, so stop whining about it and play.  

Those are my ideas - what ELSE should we do to make football better?

Question | Answer
:--|:--
[What's your opinion on historical Jesus? What do you find the best evidence for his existence? How reliable do you think the official gospels are in terms of indicating what Christians in the 1st Century believed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37t61o) | The best evidence is logic. It is much more reasonable to assume that someone named Jesus did exist and a (largely fanciful) cult developed around his personality than to assume that he didn't exist and people made up Christianity out of whole cloth. As I always point out when asked this question: if Jesus didn't exist, the easiest way for a non-Christian to debunk Christianity in the first century would have been to go to Nazareth and show that no one had ever heard of the man. But no 1st-2nd century non-Christians (specifically Jews) ever argued that Jesus didn't exist; they only argued that he wasn't Messiah.
[What's your opinion on Matthew 15 and other passages which seem to clearly indicate that Jesus kept the Old Testament laws and their penalties? Are there good reasons to doubt this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37t61o) | I have to back up a second to answer this properly. Mark was the first Gospel written, and Matthew is based on Mark. It's fairly clear that Matthew's community was in the process of separating from the synagogue when the author wrote the Gospel. So, that Gospel is deeply committed to maintaining Jewish traditions in the face of this separation from the synagogue. So Matthew 15 is not, in itself, particularly good evidence for or against Jesus' interest in keeping Jewish law. However, it is also fairly certain that Jesus never imagined that his followers would stop being Jewish, or that they would stop behaving as Jews. Rather it's more likely that he wanted them to be extra-special Jewish (according to his criteria), in order to please God.
[Do you think that Christianity as it is written in the Bible is a positive or negative influence on human behavior? I'm not counting here people who simply use it to support their existing morality, but those who sincerely take it all seriously and try and reconcile the good with the bad.](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37t61o) | There are parts of the Bible that are among the most radically life-affirming, love-demanding and morality-promoting texts any human being could ever read. But there are also deeply, deeply flawed parts that Western society has finally begun to realize should be set aside (like issues of sexuality). It is my firm conviction that the best way for believers (i.e., not for myself) to treat the Bible is to recognize that it is a human construct intended as an expression of faith in God, rather than as a divine construct intended as an expression of control over humanity.
[So when did the debate over Jesus become an issue for non-Christians?](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37tig7) | The debate over the messianic identity of Jesus became an issue on ""day one."" That was the main dividing line between Christian Jews and non-Christian Jews (bearing in mind that, at the beginning, all Christians were Jewish). The debate over the existence of Jesus is really a post-Enlightenment thing, with the rise of scientific inquiry.
[It's possible that the Gospels were based on accounts from actual apostles, but since there were many gospels around at the time that weren't made official and considered apocryphal, they just as easily could also have been invented based on Paul's original common story.](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37tig7) | All of your comments up to this point are reasonable; I just want to adjust this one bit a tiny amount. We don't know what Paul's original common story was; he never tells us anything about ""Jesus of the flesh."" And from what we know of the Gospels, only the author of Luke-Acts was familiar with Paul and Pauline Christianity. Mark and Matthew were in all likelihood written in communities that were never contacted by Paul.
[Is there any better evidence for Jesus than Achilles or other figures we consider fictional, that had stories told about them not long after they were supposedly alive? Is the Odyssey any better evidence for Achilles than the Gospels are for Paul's epistles?](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37tig7) | Yes, if only because the time differentials are significantly different. The first writings about Jesus that still exist were set down less than 30 years after his death, and it is very likely that there were writings about Jesus (such as Q and Q-like writings) that we no longer have but predate Paul and the Gospels. The writings about Achilles and other mythical-historical figures were written many, many centuries after the events being described.
[I've been reading Karen Armstrong, the wiki on Historicity of Jesus, and The Silence That Screams, among other sources, and am struck by how it all could easily have been invented wholesale by Paul, yet so many take his existence as unquestionable.](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37tig7) | That is very, very unlikely. Paul was not the first Christian, and he wasn't the only preaching Christian. We tend to assume that he was a big deal during his day because we have many of his letters and no letters of any other contemporaries, but he himself makes clear that he wasn't the only gig in town. Christianity existed before Paul (otherwise he couldn't have become a Christian); it existed independent of Paul during and after his life. At the very least, it's clear that three of the four canonical Gospels were written without ever having had contact with Pauline Christianity - the Gospel of John being a particularly obvious case.
[What are these earliest writings about Jesus?](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37u8w1) | The earliest (extant) writings about Jesus are from Paul - in particular, 1 Thessalonians appears to be the earliest preserved writing that we have. There were almost certainly even earlier writings than that, but we no longer have them - they are lost to the accidents of history. But we have some of their fingerprints, especially in the Gospels where there is a source known as ""Q"" embedded into Matthew and Luke that predates both of them, and probably predates Mark (and maybe Paul) as well.
[You say that Jesus wouldn't have thought Jews would stop being jewish but his teachings seem so opposite from the OT. To me the OT God is petty, rigid and capricious like a republican alcoholic while Jesus is a hippie democrat. How does this square with Jesus respecting OT teachings of the time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37znuf) | ""I come with a sword"" is not particularly hippie, though. And in Matthew, Jesus is very adamant about retaining the legal requirements of Jewish tradition.
[I know this is stupid question, since any PhD is a difficult matter requiring hard work, but how would you describe the whole experience? How long did it take you? Did you meet any academic nutjobs on the way? What was your thesis?](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37z613) | It took my 7 years and I loved most of that time. There are nutjobs everywhere you go, no more or less in academia, though the flavor is different. My dissertation was on 1 Corinthians 14:13-25.
[[deleted]](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37t5ip) | Briefly: Jesus died in around 30-33 CE (Common Era, which is better than saying AD especially when you're in non-Christian company, since AD means Year of Our Lord). His followers probably scattered for a few years, then returned as a stable group in Jerusalem. Sometime in the 40s, Saul/Paul became a Christian and began to bring the Jesus movement outside of Palestine and into the northern Mediterranean. (Other Christians were doing the same in other areas, but we have little recorded evidence.)
 | The last writings of the NT were completed in around 100-110 CE. Over the next couple of centuries, the various Christian communities began to communicate with one another more effectively and frequenty, and over time a canon developed - a collection of authoritative writings that were selected simply on the basis of the fact that they were used by most Christians. So, we get the New Testament, which is fixed in its current form around the year 300.
 | During those centuries between around 100 and 300, Christianity moves into the political classes of the Roman Empire, gaining influence over the rulers of the day in various places, until eventually Constantine is ""converted."" In all likelihood he never actually believed; instead, he saw that Christianity was a major force that he could use to unify the empire, and so he claimed allegiance to Jesus as a way of manipulating the church.
 | That's really the earliest we could speak of a ""Roman Catholic Church,"" although it wasn't a dividing line by any means. The Roman Catholic Church was never really ""founded"" either. Rather, the church in Rome became dominant because Rome itself was the dominant, cosmopolitan, political center of the Empire.
 | The two best books I've read on the New Testament (that are accessible to interested non-specialist readers) are Bart Ehrman's introduction and Luke Timothy Johnson's introduction. Ehrman himself is an atheist; Johnson is Catholic. Of the two, I think Johnson's is better.
[What about how the books of the Canon were selected? Is the Apocryphic writings legitimate in their own way?](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37uzwy) | The books of the canon weren't selected in any deliberate sense. What happened was that different Christian communities used different sets of texts, and then shared them, and then shared what they liked and didn't like, what they used and didn't use. Eventually, most Christian communities tended to be using the same set of texts, while a few groups used other sets (smaller, larger, different, what have you). These smaller groups didn't survive, so eventually the majority of Christians were using the same 27 writings of the New Testament. The ""apocryphal"" writings were legitimate for those communities that used them, and not legitimate for those who didn't. Accidents of history led us to the 27 writings we have now, but these 27 were not selected - they were used.
[You said the canon was developed on the ""basis of the fact that they were used by most Christians."" Was this the only criteria used to determine the canon? I have come to understand they based this on other factors as well, such as, the earliest writings, and the writings that didn't conflict with the earliest writings. Is that incorrect? Also, are there any non-canonical writings that would be considered early enough to be legitimate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37umgx) | Those criteria are all after the fact, as a way to explain the decisions that were already made by the natural development of the communities. There are typically four criteria that early church writers claimed to use: apostolicity, universality, orthodoxy and inspiration. But each of these really just boiled down to the fact that a text was used because it was used. There are a few non-canonical writings that are fairly early, like the Gospel of Thomas. But ""legitimacy"" is hard to pin down. Mark and Matthew were almost certainly written in or near Palestine, putting them closer to the geographical starting point of Christianity than any of the other Gospels. Is that a valuable piece of information? Perhaps; perhaps not.
[What I mean to say is that the gospels that are in the canon are the earliest and best sources for early Christianity that we currently have because they were written, as you said, closer to Palestine, and were written earlier than any of the extant non-canonical (gnostic) gospels. I had thought that since they were written at an earlier date they would be more representative of the earliest form of Christianity than the gnostic gospels and any gospel that was not put in the canon that we know of today since they are all dated later. I see that you equate Mark and Matthew to be of equal value historically to the later written gnostic gospels, and maybe they are, I just wondered what your reason for thinking that would be.](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37v2r1) | I don't equate Mark and Matthew to be equal to one another, though, since Matthew was based on Mark. Mark was the first written Gospel. It was written no later than 69 CE, during the final stages of the Jewish War, in Palestine. So, on the whole, Mark is closer to the original traditions. However, there are bits and pieces within other Gospels (such as the Q elements of Matthew and Luke) that probably come from around the same time as Mark, and possibly/probably earlier. Insofar as the Gospel of Thomas contains some of those things (like really early formulations of certain Q sayings), it can be seen as ""closer"" than Mark. But on the whole, Mark is earliest/closest.
[Do you have any information on the numerous ""Christian"" sects that were wiped out by the Catholic church because they worshiped differently?](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37u68o) | They weren't ""wiped out by the Catholic church"" so much as they never got a foothold in numbers and therefore were absorbed by more dominant groups of Christianity. By the time Catholicism became a ""thing"" it was already the dominant flavor. But yes, we do have some information about many of the groups, particularly the Gnostic groups, which left many of their writings in the dry sands of Egypt. Other groups we only know about because other Christians (the theological winners) wrote tracts denouncing them and their beliefs.
[I was under the impression that at certain points, the catholic church literally put certain ""pagans"" to the sword. Said pagans were worshipers of Jesus Christ, but had very different ideas about how to worship, up to and including communal sex.](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37uaj9) | Yes, but that was much later than the timeframe that I was assuming (i.e., not early Christianity). Early on, Christianity didn't have enough political or legal clout to go around indiscriminately killing off their antagonists, internal or external.
[Think we'll ever find the Q or similar texts/scrolls/parchment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37t6wk) | We have, in fact. We found the Gospel of Thomas, which is surprisingly close to what Q probably looked like: a series of sayings of Jesus disconnected from one another, without context. If you've not read Thomas before, I encourage you to do so. Some of it is really, really trippy. And the amazing thing is that it's very likely that many of the sayings in GThom that match the sayings in the canonical Gospels are actually older versions than the ones in the Bible.
[Am I incorrect, or isn't the extant version of Thomas a Coptic rendition of an earlier sayings Gospel? From what I've read and learned, the roots of Thomas are perhaps older than Mark and Q, but the text itself has been filtered through Coptic Christian tradition and is thus slightly askew from the original version upon which it is based.](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37z928) | Yes, you're basically correct. It's probable that GThom is a translation of an earlier sayings Gospel, though by no means is that certain. In any event, it is a ""filtered"" text, whether or not its predecessors were written or oral, just like all of the Gospel texts we have.
[Could you give a brief account of this comment in relation to David Friedrich Strauss: ""discovered the ""mythological"" basis of the Gospel story""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37twuz) | He recognized that most of the stories in the Gospels follow certain patterns that he believed most myths followed (things like the virgin birth, walking on water, etc.). He argued that this can only mean that the Gospels should not be taken literally as historical reconstructions of Jesus' life, but they should be understood instead as foundational stories and mythological narratives about the religion's founder. I can't really do justice to his theories, and given that we are living in a post-Strauss world it's virtually impossible for me to convey just how mindblowingly earth-shattering his views were during his lifetime. We now take for granted that which Strauss strenuously argued.
[How radical was the communal lifestyle that Jesus and his followers were living? Were there several 'guru' style groups like this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37vibq) | We don't know if they did live a communal lifestyle or not. The Gospels don't give that kind of detail. There were several people like Jesus running around during those decades, though.
[Was claiming to be the messiah a normal thing back then? How often would a normal household be proselytized by a follower of a new claimant?](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37vibq) | It wasn't normal, but it wasn't rare. We have no data showing how frequently people were attracted to these messianic figures, unfortunately.
[The NT isn't really a cohesive 'biography' of Jesus in any way. Is there a book you'd recommend that writes the story of the life of Jesus in that form? If not, you should get crackin', it's a damn good idea.](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37vibq) | It's been done many, many times over the past couple of centuries, always with different results. I'd challenge you by saying that a biography of Jesus is sort of a bad thing, and suggest you read Albert Schweitzer's The Quest of the Historical Jesus.
[How close is the current bible to the original writings? for instance, has there been editing by the church over time which has strongly changed the content of the bible?](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37u1d2) | The answer to this question is more complicated than you might think. As far as intentional, wide-spread theological changes by ""The Church"", no - that didn't happen. What did happen, however, is that the printing press didn't exist for most of Christian history. Scribes had to make copies by hand, and they would often make mistakes and sometimes they'd make intentional changes to a line here or there. The King James Version of the Bible is a translation based on a ""family"" of rather poor manuscripts of the Greek text. Scholars now know that those manuscripts are among the least reliable. We don't have any ""originals"" (called autographs) but we do have copies from much earlier than the ones used by the KJV editors. We have some manuscripts from the early 2nd century (though incomplete), for example. Textual critics now make it their life's goal to reconstruct the best original-like manuscript they can using the fragments and copies that still exist. Modern translations are based on this recent work.
[I have always wondered, with all the corruption that has occurred throughout the history of the church, have there been popes who have changed the bible to favor their own beliefs? did they add, change or remove passages with the intent to control people?](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37u1d2) | Surprisingly, no, not really. There were some major changes that we can clearly identify from the very early church (first couple of centuries), but nothing significant after the third century or so. For example, the ending of Mark originally was 16:8 (""and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid""), but most later manuscripts have one or another longer ending tacked on. Trinitarian language was added to the letters of John sometime in the first couple of centuries, but we have manuscripts from earlier that don't contain that language. Probably the most egregious additions were made to the Book of Acts, which in some manuscripts is a full 1/3 longer than more reliable copies. However, once the New Testament canon was more or less stabilized, no one made any significant deliberate changes - though I'm sure they were sorely tempted.
[The New World Translation (Jehovah's Witnesses' magic book) has the following for John 1:1 ""In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was a god."" Is this the correct translation from the original scriptures? I've heard people say that they have mistranslated (on purpose) to stick to their dogma (Jesus is the son of God, and not God in the flesh).](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37v18n) | No, it's a bad translation. It misunderstands the original Greek rather badly. There's a big discussion of this particular verse in (I believe) the introductory Greek textbook by Mounce or the intermediate textbook by his student (whose name I've forgotten). Suffice it to say, the proper translation is ""In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."" Only a newbie Biblical Greek student would make that mistake, so I'm inclined rather to think it was a dogmatically necessary decision on their part.
[I'm still a freshmen in Greek, but I don't believe there's really an indefinite article. Everything reads as ""the"" noun, and to insert an indefinite article like ""a"" noun, you'd have to know for certain from the context that it was intended.](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37xiux) | That's more or less the case, yes. There's a specific construction being used in John 1:1 that demands that you not read an implied indefinite article in there.
[In the past, say, two hundred years or so, who would you say has been the most significant scholar to study and examine the Bible?](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37t9go) | There are two, actually. The first would be Albert Schweitzer, who wrote The Quest of the Historical Jesus back at the turn of the 20th century, before he became a medical missionary in Africa. The second would be David Friedrich Strauss, writing in the mid-19th century. He was a deeply religious man who (unfortunately for him) discovered the ""mythological"" basis of the Gospel story and wrote The Life of Jesus Critically Examined in German in the 1830s. He was ostracized and ridiculed by many, translated into English by George Eliot, and died rather unappreciated shortly before all of his ideas were vindicated (in large part by Schweitzer). He also pretty much died an atheist.
[Why was Jesus so damn influential in his time and the centuries after his death? Obviously he was a great philosopher, but was there more to it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37t9go) | Jesus himself wasn't the influence; his followers were. His followers happened to come on the scene at exactly the right time and in exactly the right place. 30 years after Jesus died, Jerusalem was sacked by the Romans and the Temple was destroyed, forever changing the nature of Jewish identity. Whereas before Jews had the Temple for the center of their worship, now they gravitated toward Torah (Hebrew Bible generally), while Christians gravitated toward Jesus. A whole lot of other factors conspired to make Christianity a religion that survived the early birth pangs, and becoming a major part of one of the largest empires the world has ever known certainly didn't hurt.
[Jesus vs. Mecha Godzilla. Who wins?](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37t9go) | Mecha Godzilla, obviously. Because everything they say about him is true.
[Are there significant theological differences in the books of the Bible that were written before and after 70 AD? Or was it all essentially already there before those events?](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37vqcs) | You can detect differences in pre- and post-War writings, though it's not as pervasive as you might think. The bigger change was geographical: the farther away you get from Jerusalem, the... more different? ...the theology.
[What is your view on the idea of virgin birth of Christ? Is its mention in the gospels a translation error like many suggest? Did followers of Jesus really believe he was born of a virgin?](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37wd7l) | It's not a translation error in the simple sense. Here's what happened: The Hebrew word for ""young woman"" is alma. This is what appears in the original Hebrew text. When it was translated into Greek for the Septuagint, it was translated as ""parthenos"" which can mean ""young woman"" but usually meant virgin. The New Testament writers and their communities were all writing/reading in Greek and they used the Greek Bible (the Septuagint) as their scriptures. So in that passage where the Hebrew read ""young woman"" they saw ""virgin"" instead. This led to the tradition that Jesus was born of a virgin rather than just a young woman, as a way to conform to a passage that they already believed was a prophetic message about Jesus the messiah.
[What were the major forks in early Christianity prior to Constantine?](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37t8ig) | Generally speaking, there was ""mainstream"" Christianity and Gnosticism. But it's not really that clean, actually. There were a number of groups that appeared over the centuries: Montanism, Valentinianism, various different Gnostic flavors. Rather than speaking of forks, I think it's more effective to think of combinations. Christianity started out incredibly diverse and became even more diverse for a few centuries, then in the course of about 150-200 years began to coalesce into a generally unified tradition (which later became known as Roman Catholicism) until the split between East and West and then, later, the splits during the Reformation.
[How late did the Roman, Greek, and Egyptian pantheons and cult groups last as viable religions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37t8ig) | A surprisingly long time - at least 4 centuries. There were non-Christian philosophers and pantheistic theologians running around the Mediterranean and North Africa even during Augustine's day. Many cult groups died out rather fast (like Mithraism), but not all.
[In your opinion, is it even worth debating whether Nazareth was a real place? Where does the research currently lie in that regard?](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37tq57) | Nazareth was, and is, a real place. Archeological evidence shows clearly that the current city of Nazareth is the same city that was around during the first century. And the fact that Matthew and Luke have to go through contortions to make Jesus born in Bethlehem makes it fairly certain that Jesus really was from Nazareth. (If he wasn't, the writers could simply have had him be born in Bethlehem without any circuitous routes to get his parents there.)
[That's the opposite of where I thought the research on early Christian geography currently sat.](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37tw12) | To be clear, all of the landmarks in Nazareth regarding Jesus are almost certainly ""fake"" - identified by Palestinian Christians as a way to make money off people who were on pilgrimages.
[Concerning Saul/Paul... I have heard some theories that his version of Christianity was not accepted by the other sects/""churches"" in his time. Do you think there is any merit to this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37tubw) | Absolutely - he says as much. If you read Galatians especially you can see that Paul is struggling with other Christians who disagree fundamentally with his views on Gentiles. He was at odds with the Jerusalem church (Peter and his followers) for many years. And he has a lot of really snarky things to say about people who come into his congregations and try to ""pray away the Paul,"" as it were. (He likes to call them ""super-apostles"", as a highly sarcastic backhanded compliment.)
[What do you think was the doctrine or event that made Christianity so popular?](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37uh4i) | Not one thing in particular, but I will say that one of the things that made Christianity so successful was that in the beginning it spread among all classes of people, not just among one particular group or group type. That tended not to be the case among other religious groups (such as Mithraism, which was largely confined to veterans, and only permitted men).
[Why Jewish people started to consider Jesus as a genuine religious leader? When?](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37uh4i) | If I'm understanding your question correctly... The early followers of Jesus were, naturally, Jewish, as he was. Best guess is that he began preaching his particular vision of Judaism in the early 30s and developed a following first in the Galilee region and then in and around Jerusalem. After his death, those who were not already his followers were unlikely to become followers because, since his followers considered him the messiah, Jesus' death was a bit of a problem. (The messiah wasn't supposed to die, under traditional views of who the messiah was.)
[Do you think that Jesus had all the requirements to be the prophesied messiah?](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37uh4i) | He had virtually none of them, according to the most common messianic expectations of his day.
[Personally, the teachings of the gospel have been useful for you in some hard situations in your life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37uh4i) | Not specifically, no. But I do greatly admire many of the ideas presented in the New Testament.
[For christmas: Do you thing that the ""three"" wise men that supposedly visitated Jesus probably practiced Zoroastrian religion? (I mean, Jewish people were slaves in Persia, so these religions influenced each other, so there are many similarities between these religion, Am I right?)](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37uh4i) | It's possible, but there is no way to know. Matthew doesn't make any reference to who these men were (or even that there were three of them), he only mentions that they came from the east. They could just as easily have been Babylonian Jews.
[Do you see religion as a myth, a lie, a spiritual and moral system, a perspective, a reasonable position or as a mix of these theings? Why? Does it merites some respect?](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37uh4i) | I see it as a mix of all those things (though not really a ""lie""). It does merit respect when it does good; it merits condemnation when it does evil.
[*The messiah wasn't supposed to die, under traditional views of who the messiah was.* You have said that a couple of times, do you have a source for that at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37uy28) | None close to hand, but if you look at Jewish writings of the period you can see a pattern that (generally speaking) shows an expectation that the messiah would come as a triumphant warrior-king or warrior-priest to completely change the social order and restore the promised land to the people of God, within his lifetime.
[Which translation do you think is best?](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37udrn) | If you want a translation that is artful and beautiful and brilliant, you can't beat the King James. If you want a translation that is accurate and based on critical investigation, go with the New Revised Standard Version, especially if you can get a ""Study Bible"" version that has copious notes, maps and charts. The Oxford Annotated and HarperCollins Annotated editions were both put together by the best scholars in the fields of OT and NT, and the notes are fantastic.
[What do you think of Gary Greenburg's work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37t66x) | I'm not familiar with Greenburg, but from what I've just googled I think I am safe in saying that I would not be terribly impressed. He seems to be interested more in shock value than proper scholarship. I'm always very suspicious of those, because they usually fall into crackpot territory.
[Do you think the Christianity was a good thing, on the whole, for society? Do you think Christianity had done more charity for the world with a few black marks, has done a lot of evil to the world with a few good marks, or somewhere inbetween?](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37tnz4) | These are difficult questions because they get into the realm of ethics and sociology over the course of many centuries. I can only speak about the 1st and 2nd centuries in anything like a scholarly capacity. So what I say here to answer your questions is entirely my opinion and not based on research or critical investigation. I think Christianity was a good thing, for a long time. In many ways it was involved intimately in many advancements in Western civilization. However, once Western civilization started to impinge upon other civilizations, Christianity became more danger than boon. It became oppressive, violent, uncharitable and racist. I think that over the past 2000 years, the balance sheet for Christianity has generally been in the red (bad). However, I am hopeful that, starting with developments that began in the middle of the 20th century and are continuing today in the form of feminist, womanist and subaltern theologies (among others), Christianity can change course and become a force for truth and justice and all that good stuff. When Christians recognize the deep-seated need for social justice that their religion demands, they can do incredibly great things, beyond all imagining, and uplift humanity out of suffering and deprivation. When they forget, there is no greater evil that humanity can know.
[What sort of advancements did they have a hand in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37u4bd) | A lot of Greek philosophy was ""lost"" during the medieval period (preserved only by the Muslims of the Arabian Peninsula), but a lot of Christian theology had been based on Greek ethics, so when different political institutions started cropping up throughout Europe, many of the ideas about human dignity were translated over through Christianity. It's not so much that Christianity ""had a hand in"" specific advancements as much as it is that Christianity was a stable foundation on which different innovators were able to operate (within certain limits - think Galileo and Copernicus). And frankly I don't think it is much of a stretch to suggest that the development of the scientific method owes much of its existence to the centuries of Christian intellectual theology that preceded it.
[What sort of dangers came about as a result of the advent (haha) of Western colonialism?](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37u4bd) | I can't speak too clearly about this, since it's not my area of expertise, but there are a few things I can briefly mention. In particular, the notion that human beings exist on a gradation of moral agency, such that non-European ""races"" were considered inferior not just intellectually but also morally. Also, the idea that the world is divided into believers and heathens, and that the world should not be so divided, created mass slaughter and oppression on a massive scale, especially in Latin America during the 15th and 16th centuries.
[Some people say that Christianity/religion was a vehicle by which Western European powers could exercise political control over the masses. Others say that the characteristics of the religion itself are the flaws by which it can be used to oppress/conquer people. Where do you stand in that spectrum?](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/c37u4bd) | I believe that any religion can be co-opted by political interests; Christianity isn't alone in this. However, Christianity is especially guilty because it is inherently evangelical, meaning that it attempts to spread itself into places where it does not already exist. Politicians can use this to great effect.

I plan on building a decent machine, and my budget right now is  ~$600.00+    I'd like to get some of the bare bones out of the way, then invest another $600.00 down the road (more RAM, another GPU). As it stands, I'd like to be able to play Star Craft 2 &amp; Diablo 3 with my brother, and also blow away the Asus NXXX I picked out for him for college (Model escapes me atm). Anyway, being the older brother, I'd like to build a machine, for hopefully around the same cost as his laptop, but, I'd like to, crush it if possible? Only really because he keeps bragging about it and putting my scavanged machines down haha =)



I'll be using this pc for/as a:
Gaming (Star Craft, Diablo 3), 
Small Game Server -- 4 - 8 players,
Web Server for some small personal sites,
Programming,
Multi-Monitor 5+,
Simultaneous use of all these features.

It may be cheaper to get a dedicated desktop server... but, I'd like to see where an All-in-One build can go.


Here are some specs I'm looking for:

**MOBO: ~$200.00**
A motherboard with a 32GB RAM capacity, and dual PCIe x16s for SLI or Crossfire later on (just need 1 GPU with my current budget). not really concerned with RAID, but, a higher end MOBO will probably just come with RAID10 capability?

**CPU: ~$200.00**
I wanted to get the AMD FX-8150 and overclock it to 4.8GHz/core, but read some reviews and benchmarks and I'm having serious second thoughts about it; [thought eight cores would be great](http://www.bit-tech.net/hardware/cpus/2011/10/12/amd-fx-8150-review/12), but I guess [not?](http://pcpartpicker.com/benchmarks/cinebench/render-single/overall-list/)


**GPU: ~$200.00?  ~$300.00?  ~~$400.00???**
Do certain GPUs play better with certain CPUs? 
I'm having a hard time choosing which GPU I should get.... especially since I'll upgrading via SLI or Crossfire later. Is it ""ever worth it"" to get a $400.00 GPU? Thoughts &amp; suggestions?

**RAM: ~$200.00**
What's better,  [CAS 11, 1.5V 2133 (2 x 8GB) sticks of RAM](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231571&amp;Tpk=2133%20DDR3%20%282%20x%208GB%29),
or [CAS 9, 1.6V 2133 (2 x 8GB) sticks?](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820144596&amp;Tpk=2133%20DDR3%20%282%20x%208GB%29)

**SSD 60GB: ~$70.00**
[Core drive that'll hold my main games](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/mushkin-internal-hard-drive-mknssdcr60gb)

**PSU: ~$120.00?**
It follows then, that these components, (CPU, and GPUx2) primarily, will determine the wattage of the PSU I'll need, right? Then I just choose a PSU from a reputable brand with good reviews?

**Tower: ~$150.00?**
Haven't really even looked at these yet....

I'll be on for a little while yet. But like AMAs, I gotta talk to a man about a horse in... about whenever it's inconvenient for you, haha ;)  Hoping to get some help though, really want a PC that can develop, game, and serve at the same time =)

I want the woman to do all the talking, and her just repeating ""I want to suck your dick"" over and over does the trick.  However, they usually seem to want a back and forth (understandable), and they keep things more linear.  If my dick is in their pussy, there is some rearranging that needs to happen to get it somewhere else.  

My assumption is that what they say is perhaps insight into what they want to hear, but I don't know for sure.  Maybe it's what they expect I want, and in reality they just want me to say ""I want to lick your pussy"" over and over like I want them to say ""I want to suck your dick"" over and over.

There are still some holes but it's good enough to scale enemy health/damage quite reliably.

More info about Fractal scaling and various other stuff can be found here: http://www.dtguilds.com/forum/m/6563292/viewthread/12997907-advanced-mechanics

Changes for http://gw2dungeons.net

* All numeric values for Fractal enemies now scale based on your Fractal scale setting (you can test this on settings page)
* Added lots of damage, health, cooldown and armor values to fractal and dungeon enemies (lots of still missing)
* Added setting to simplify enemy health/armor (for armor it gives Light, Medium, Heavy)
* Added some advertising (testing whether it gives any meaningful profit, if you don't like them feel free to adblock or disable from site's settings)
* Added links to [KING]'s Fractal video guides, will probably be expanded to dungeons f I find appropriate guides
* Did some performance stuff so the page should load faster
* Lots of all around tweaks / bug fixes to the content

As usually, any ideas are always welcome! Even if I don't implement them right away I will add them to ideas/todo list."	18	25

And you have 3 lives to do so. Code is [here](https://gist.github.com/anonymous/a7a84cce6a2ca84e2fa9). I can upload the .fla file somewhere if it's necessary as well.

#1: The objects will fall, but after they hit the bottom, more do not appear up at the top. The code I have for that makes apples fall is on Line 45, for grapes is on line 81, and for oranges is on line 115. I found quite a few examples online, and it looked like I had exactly what they did, but apparently I don't. What I have I believe takes the fruit that fell off the stage out of the array, and should add a new one up at the top. Not sure what I did wrong.

Problem #2: I can't get the game to detect when any of the fruit hits the basket. I made hitboxes for the fruit and the basket, and put them onto the stage (lines 24-27), and used hitTestObject on them, but I'm assuming I did this wrong or it's something I did with naming my movie clips in the library."	0	0

In [this video](http://youtu.be/YYBlH3HmFIQ) you see some dude doing a little hammer training. I want to build an electricity generating machine involving a piston or something that you could hit with a sledge hammer, just like this guy is hitting the tire.

I understand that this might not generate a large amount of electricity, but I just really enjoy the concept of humans generating electricity during a workout. I figure the stronger you get, the more work you can do and the more electricity you could generate, which is a cool concept. I'm not looking to make this into a product or anything, I just want one for myself.

So my question is this: If I know nothing about engineering, how do I go about building this? Are there engineers out there who would help me build one of these, just as a fun project? If so, where do I find them?"	0	5

I got back from Army BCT and AIT in August and was perceived as quite the catch on Grindr for a while. I live in Kansas, so all the gays pretty much know each other. One guy in the town over messages me. We exchange naughty pictures, but nothing comes of it. I move on. Never really keep in touch with the guy. Fast forward a few months, I have an awesome boyfriend now! (Go me!) The bf and I decide it's ok to keep our grindrs since we're mature guys in our mid-20s. We have a firm grasp on our hormones, so neither of us really has a reason to cheat. Well out of the blue, this guy from a few months ago messages me again asking if I'm dating someone now. My profile was updated to say I am. I say yes, and he starts trying to convince me to get my bf to agree to a 3-way with him. I say maybe in the future, after we've had that conversation. Then he goes off the deep end and says he will tell my bf that I've been cheating on him, that I'm into weird kinky things, and that he will ruin my relationship if I don't agree to this 3 way. I ask him why he is doing this. He says it's because he wants me all to himself and that he loves drama. I lose it. He then tells me he's already done all these things (my bf works late, so he was still asleep and hadn't seen the messages when this guy was telling me all this. Otherwise I know I would have heard about it). Apparently he's been all over my profile and my bf's profile. We don't even know this guy. I hadn't talked to him since August, and we had never met face to face. I report him to Grindr and block him. My boyfriend and I had a long talk, worked things out and agreed that this guy is just a troll trying to break us up for fun, and we both deleted our Grindrs and Scruffs and stuff. Nothing he has said is true. But apparently he's started creating fake profiles on Twitter to harrass my boyfriend. He's made more than one profile, and he keeps getting reported and blocked, but still continues to make new profles. I'm afraid it might get out of hand. Does anyone have any advice on how to handle him? If this keeps up for a few days, when (if ever) would it be ok to contact the authorities? 

TL;DR: Crazy guy from grindr I've never actually met has started harrassing my boyfriend because I wouldn't agree to a threeway. How do I handle him?"	2	10

I've been in more stage plays than I can count, television commercials, small films, and even landed a small one-shot role on a national television show. I love it, and I'm good at it. 

About 10 months ago my work situation changed, and I suddenly had to make some hard decisions about my goals and priorities and the reality of being able to support a wife and two children. The concept of being a professional actor was slowly, but surely, pushed down and aside in favor of being a responsible adult. 

In my desperate attempt to find gainful employment after abruptly losing the job of been in for nearly three years, I landed in a manufacturing job for an excellent local company, making better money with full benefits and excellent job security. Unfortunately, I am not working swing shifts on a 4-10 M-TH schedule. This almost instantly eliminates the one remaining outlet for my acting: the local community theater that I've been active with as an actor and director for last ten years or so. There's no way I can do it on this schedule, and I'm not seeing a change any time in the foreseeable future. 

And, to make matters trickier, my wife is currently involved with one of those rare and magical productions where everyone just clicks and the ensemble rocks and the cast becomes a family on and off stage. Now, I am honestly and sincerely happy that she's getting to experience this, but it poses a problem for me. It just highlights every thing that I'm missing out on, and all I can do is sit on the outside and watch enviously. If I try to talk about it, I come across as petty and resentful, which I don't want. But it burns my heart to see the pinnacle, the holy grail, of what I love about acting in a small theater, and to be an outsider, a distant observer and to know that I don't get that, and possibly will not ever again. 

Anyway, I don't have any specific question or agenda here. I just wanted to get this crap off my chest without burdening my friends and family with something that will likely hurt their ability to enjoy their own experiences. If you've gotten this far, thanks for reading. :-)

Tl;dr - my new job will not allow me to pursue my lifelong passion as a hobby, and it sucks. Hard. "	1	4

Getting a sweet city spot is so much more satisfying than building any early wonder (except Petra/Alhambra). Still trying to perfect strat though. Anyway, been settling on hills a lot since I love me that early game production, garrisoned units being able to fire full range and I feel like it gives higher strength to the city too (can anyone confirm?).

Once in you can type '.setup' to see the scrim options. After 2 hours the server will shut its self down and delete its self to free up space / bandwidth for more servers. 

Please visit the HELP section on the page.
Currently accounts are limited to 1 server each.

There are options when making the server to add 

* hostname (optional)
* server password (optional)
* rcon password (optional)
* tickrate - 64/128
* max players (up to 16 and low as 2)
* map - dust2/overpass/inferno/train/nuke/season/mirage/cache/cbble - more can be added
* server type - competitive/classic

If you finish before the server expires you can destroy your server manually from the server options

Logins are handled through Steam oAuth2

This is still in beta so it might not be perfect but anybody willing to test it out is muchly appreciated.


Please leave any feedback here or with PMs

Edit: More servers are coming in the near future.

Edit: Thank you for receiving this so nicely :) - I am working on fixing any issues or bugs at the moment as this is still in beta for the most part. Thank you. "	699	229

I was at the bar. It was a Friday night. I was at least 6 or 7 beers deep with a couple shots of fireball in me. I was feeling good, and it was only midnight. I still had a good 2 hours of drinking left. It was going to be a great night. Hell, it already was a great night! Like I said, I was already drunk, I was hanging out with my best friends. It was a Friday night. What more could I ask for?


Than I see this girl walk in the bar.  She was wearing a white dress with flip flops. She had long dark hair and green eyes and moved so swiftly and elegantly. Our eyes locked and I immediately looked away. I told my drunken friend to look at the girl by the door. I called dibs before he could. It was a game we played. When we seen a girl we liked and wanted to hit on, we called dibs. That meant the other person could NOT, under any circumstances, try to hit on this girl. 


He looked over by the door. I thought to myself ""he is going to be pissed."" This was the absolute perfect female. Even in my drunken state I knew she had it all. She was just perfect. He looked back at me confused. ""What girl? I don't see any girl worth calling dibs on over there. How many have you had?""


I snuck another glance over there. She was still standing there, two tables from the door, staring at me. Why couldn't he notice her? I was getting frustrated. I didn't want him seeing her 20 minutes later and calling dibs, saying that I never called it. 


""Dude. The girl in the fucking white dress. Two tables from the door!"" I said, frustrated.


""Alright man. I don't see any girl in a white dress over there. But you can have dibs on her if you want."" He than walked away.


I looked back over. She was still staring at me. She was obviously into me. I chugged the rest of my beer and got up the guts to go talk to her.


I walked over to her. ""How's it going?"" I awkwardly asked her. 


She continued to stare at me intently. If I wasn't so fucking drunk I may have been a little freaked out by this. But she was so god damn hot, I didn't care. It wasn't very often a girl this hot paid this much attention to me. 


""I'm alright."" She finally answered. 


""What's your name? I'm Jake."" 


""I know who you are. I've been watching you. I'm Ina.""


""Hi Ina. I noticed you watching me. That's why I had the courage to come talk to you."" I gave a nervous laugh. I thought to myself that I was fucking this ask up. I needed another beer! I was to far away from the bar to get one and didn't want to be rude and leave her.


She laughed. Such an amazing, cute laugh. ""So do you want to get out of here?"" She asked me. 


Holy shit. Holy shit. I thought to myself. Is this seriously happening to me? This never happens to me! I honestly thought this girl was the best looking girl in the entire bar, and she wanted to leave with me? No fucking way! 


""Uhh...Sure! Where would you like to go?"" I managed to spit out.


""Let's go to the riverfront."" She responded.


The bar wasn't far from the riverfront. It was a nice night out, and there was no way I was turning her down, so I agreed. We walked from the bar to the riverfront. And than we walked the trail at the riverfront. We talked and laughed the whole time. It was absolutely amazing. This was the girl of my dreams, no doubt about it.


Next thing I know I'm waking up in my bed with a pounding headache. I check my phone. It was 9:30. I immediately remember Ina and the great time we were having. I couldn't remember ever coming home. In fact, the last thing I remembered about the whole night was walking the riverfront talking. I had no idea what happened after that, and I wasn't sure why. I know I had quite a bit to drink that night, but no where near enough where I would black out and not remember anything. 


I immediately checked my phone. I was hoping I had at least got Ina's number and programmed it into my phone. Of course, no such luck. I had nothing. I called my best friend Dustin, the guy I was at the bar with, hoping he could fill me in on what happened. He said I left the bar a little after midnight and he didn't see me the rest of the night. 


I was devastated. This girl, Ina, was everything I ever wanted in a girl, and it seemed like she was totally into me. But I had no way of getting in touch with her, or even confirming that what happened that night really happened. I was starting to convince myself it was all a dream.


I could not get Ina out of my head. The week following that night, I kept having this weird dream. I was at a house. It seemed like it was in the middle of nowhere. I was standing in the yard, looking at the window of the house. Ina is staring back at me from the window. She's wearing a white nightgown. I walk into the house. There's a picture of a family hanging on the wall. Ina is in this picture. I stand in the hallway, staring at the picture. Ina stares back at me. The whole family stares back at me. I wake up, breathing heavily and sweating. 


I had that same exact dream, every night of the week following the night I met Ina. It was the Friday following the Friday I met her. It was around 9:00 and I decided I needed to get out of the house. I had been sulking all week about Ina and I needed to get over her. I still didn't know if that night really happened or if I was going nuts and just made the whole thing up. I was driving myself crazy and I just needed to get out and have a beer. 


I was driving down a one way street that was a shortcut to my favorite bar. Outta no where I seen a girl standing in the middle of the road. She had long black hair and a white night gown on. From behind she looked very similar to Ina, but she was facing the other direction so I couldn't tell for sure. I came to a complete stop in front of her and waited for her to either turn around or get the fuck out of the middle of the road. She just stood there, staring straight ahead. I was starting to get a terrible feeling about this whole situation. I just wanted to turn around and go home, but like I said I was on a one way and turning around was impossible. 


I rolled my window down. ""Excuse me ma'am. I really need to get through here. Could you please move so I can get through?"" I asked nervously.


She finally turned around. It WAS Ina! But she didn't look as beautiful as I remembered. Tonight, she looked horrifying. She stared at me with those green eyes. A grin spread across her face. Chills ran down my spine as she continued to stare at me with that grin. 


""Ina? Could you please move? I really need to get through here.""


She continued to stare at me. ""What? You're suddenly not interested in me, Jake?"" She said, continuing to stare at me with that creepy grin.



This was just to fucked up. I didn't know what to say. ""Of course I'm still interested in you.  That was the best night of my life, but I was starting to convince myself I made it all up. I haven't seen you since last weekend, and I don't remember what happened that night.""


She started laughing, hysterically.


""Jake, what do you mean you haven't seen me? You have seen me every night. I have shown you my home.""


My head was spinning. I was so fucking confused. I didn't know what to do. She walked towards my truck, went to the passenger side, opened the door and got in. 


My heart was beating so fast. I didn't know what was going on. I didn't know what she wanted. She stared at me before saying ""are you ready to take me home?""


""Ina, I don't know where you live. I have never been to your home. I think you must be mistaken.""



""Don't lie to me Jake. I fucking hate liars.""


Her expression had changed. She was still staring at me but she looked angry. I was scared out of my fucking mind. I had no idea what the hell was going on. This had to be one of my dreams that I just couldn't wake up from. 


I tried to remain calm. ""Ina, I'm sorry but I'm not lying. If I have been to your house, I do not remember. If you give me your address, I will be happy to take you home. 


She stared at me for what seemed like hours before saying ""okay Jake. Give me your phone.""


I handed the phone over without thinking twice.


I watched as she opened up the maps app. She typed in a address and handed the phone back to me. 


I looked at the screen. The destination that she had put in was 4 hours and 4 minutes away.


Confused, I looked at the address of the destination. The address was 508 East 2nd Street, Villisca, IA 50864. 


And it all hit me. This was the address of the supposedly haunted axe murder house in Villisca Iowa. I had stayed there with a bunch of friends as a joke a few years ago. I just remember us getting completely shit faced. I didn't think anything paranormal happened. 


""I'm sorry Ina, but this is just to far for me to drive tonight"" I said. ""Why do you want to go to this place anyway? This isn't your home. This is a fake haunted house. My friends and I stayed there a while back. Nothing happened.""


I remember her staring into my eyes for the longest time. Than once again, I woke up in my bed, sweat dripping down my face and my heart beating what seemed like 1000 beats per second. 


""Thank god. It was just another dream."" I thought to myself.


I looked at my phone and noticed I had a text from Dustin. The text read: ""Dude, you will never believe this!!! I won a free nights stay at the Villisca axe murder house next weekend! You're in right?""

And don't get me wrong, the first movement does get your attention right at the outset but it doesn't really *do* anything particularly interesting once it has your attention.

By the third movement, however, I feel that he's really got something interesting going on. You can hear it for yourself here:

I'm so confused because I've put way more effort into The Route Exchange site.  There is a ton more content and there should be more backlinks.

It's 90% complete and am looking for any suggestions or advice for balance and flavor. It uses an expendable pool similar to the magus' arcane pool. I wanted to limit the amount of choices it can make, but also wanted to make the choice of deity change the class in reasonable ways without defining it.

Rotate colors at home. Home game 1 is white, home game 2 is dark, home game 3 is white and so on. Visitors would just wear opposite. This allows home fans see both jerseys and not always one.

The reason I say this is because it almost seems like little notes to themselves. **ETA: one of the main reasons I think this, is because they back-tracked to come back and mangle the word ""aluminum""**

* ""Body burnt in smelter""

* SIKIKEY

* Fridy morn

* Manitowoc Sheriff

* Avery

Little blurbs. I thought of that, with the Zander Rd. sign, thinking of the good old days when I would get scratch paper and take notes when a person called me.

Thing is..I began thinking ""SIKIKEY..SIKIKEY...phonetically, what sounds like SIKIKEY?""

I came up with something, cause I remember the Samurai was one of 3 cars I believe Suzuki sold.

They had the Suzuki:

* Samurai

* Sidekick

* Swift

Sidekick. Okay, Sidekick key. Sikikey. Sidekick key. Get it? Someone hearing ""Sidekick Key"" over the phone, might write it as ""sidekick key"". But here is the thing..That's not a Sidekick in Avery's garage. And I thought the Sidekick was the Swift until just now.

THIS is what the Suzuki Sidekick looks like:

This is a Toyota Rav4:

http://www.usedcarsgroup.com/1999-toyota-rav4-salt_lake_city-ut-242058580996882964-2.jpg

Not to try to theorize on it at all, but with the way the cars it makes me think SIKIKEY is written the way someone heard ""Sidekick Key""..

Question is...is it meaning a key to a Sidekick? Or..

The the Sidekick is key..do we know if anyone involved in the case that is suspected of anything drove a Suzuki Sidekick?"	23	89

(Family fun time)	https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/4rpfpw/a_watched_pot_doesnt_boil_family_fun_time/	"This morning I woke up to 73 missed calls from various family members. The only reason I woke up is because they started calling my husbands phone. (I keep my phone on silent at night because my family is really bad at understanding the east coast/west coast time difference. Even after 4 years.)

Apparently, my mom is claiming she had a missed call/hang up from me at 5am, so they took it to mean that I was in labor. Since no one could get a hold of me, that only confirmed their suspicions. Or, you know... I was sleeping?

I checked my phone and my iPad to make sure I hadn't accidentally dialed anyone at some point in the night. Nope. So she completely made it up to... start drama? Feel important? We don't have the best relationship but lately she's been making strides and I have been proud of her, but this feels like a giant step back. I want to give her the benefit of the doubt, but she got everyone all worked up for absolutely nothing. Now I'm afraid if I don't take every call it's going to start the world's most annoying phone tree. "	50	43

I mean, if I'm being honest, I could probably get Sombra's if I set a beacon far away, hack, &amp; then retreat over &amp; over, but then I wouldn't be PTFO'ing(which would result in me getting flak from my team, because online multiplayer).

* The word ""listen"" was the only lyric I could really discern. It was repeated regularly after a single-syllable unstressed word that might have been ""just"" or ""but"", and the vocal melody descended in pitch over the course of that line

* The production and aesthetics reminded me a lot of Lorde but at a slightly faster tempo.  Synth pads were pretty prominent in the mix.

* Percussion samples were also similar to what Lorde uses, and i remember a sample of snapping on the downbeat for a part of it 

Even though much of the music sounded like a faster Lorde, I'm pretty sure from the vocals it isn't her. Vocals were higher pitched and reminded me a bit of Cocorosie"	2	2

I am quite new to this game (lv 22) so I am not that experienced. Fizz is the 3rd champ I am learning. I mained lux and ahri before (I want to know at least 3 or more champs to be not fucked up by them picking or banning my champ)

The problem is that I play quite often against ranged champs (Swain, Annie, lux, ahri) and often get behind. 

I get autoattacked multiple times, cant really autoattack them because they can stay in a save distance, have to play more passive, loose farm, get behind (money and level) and so on. 

Usually I start with dorans and 2 health potions.

I visited a plant nursery today so I have some lingo and general idea down, however sorry if I'm way off here.

I'm located in the Tampa Bay area in Florida. We just purchases a house, which has a pretty crappy lawn:

Pictures:  http://imgur.com/a/nXYnB

The lawn is really patchy, dry, and full of weeds.  I looked around to buy sod pieces, however that is a little outside our budget.  

Can anyone here guide me into the right direction to fix this lawn myself and turn it into green Bermuda or St. Augustine (or something similar) grass?   My current take on it is the following:  

Kill off grass and weeds  |  Rack dead grass and weeds  |  Spray insecticide  |  Install some type of irrigations system  |  Lay down fertilizer (not sure which one)  |  Lay and water seeds

That's my general understanding, which may be off, however I have no idea about details, timing, or cost. 

ANY help is much appreciated!  Thank you!"	1	3

You still get to choose 4 moves and everything else remains the same. You will be abke to perform combos and dodge moves. The battles will be similar to those in the anime.
Would you like it? Or would you not like it for not being similar to the old system? 
IMO, it will be really nice since it will add new spice to the battles. Tactics will be very important here. I'm bored with the current system since it's 2017. Things have changed. I still like Sun and Moon but would love to see this.

So, seeing how bad the companies directions are at the moment, wouldn't you say score per minute padding (or, as I would like to see it, gathering some certs quickly) is the way to go forward for those that don't have a mythical cert mountain?  

I like flying and only flying so for me it doesn't matter all that much; give me level 2 safefall, advanced targetting and I'm happy. Some players like to play combined arms though, the average player will be simply incapable of being competitive without the right set of implants and as such I think it is a necessary evil to keep the average gamer interested at investing time into this game; if even just some of them use these ""unfair ways"" to gain the certs they need to get competitive, we can all benefit from their presence on the battlefield as easy pickings or trusted companions!"	0	49

Who wants to hear another shipping horror story? On Wednesday, June 14th, 2017, I ordered a few parts from focusattack.com, and shipped with Fedex Ground from Pennsylvania. I got an email the next day said it had shipped. Hooray! The next day, I requested a hold at location at a local store in hopes of a more secure delivery. The day after on Friday, the tracking says that it is in my home town of Chicago. Not delivered. I think, ""That's alright, it'll be here Monday."" Money rolls around, and I check the tracking. Nothing for the day changed. I again thought, ""Well, It's a one day exception, It'll be here tomorrow."" Tuesday comes, And there was a delivery exception, saying ""No attempt made, delivery scheduled for next business day."" The package went from a facility in Chicago, to a facility in La Grange, suburb of Chicago 16 miles away, then back to Chicago. I was infuriated. Some lazy driver probably wanted to finish his shift, and clocked in early. I then think, ""It'll be here tomorrow."" Noticing a pattern? Wednesday, I walk to the local store around 7, the rime their last shipment is dropped. They say they haven't gotten anything under my name. They tell me to call the support line in the store, and I do. Through a few menus, I eventually speak to another human, and find out that they 'forgot to load it onto the truck.' I was told it would 100% be there the next day, Thursday, 6/22. I walk home in anger, and wait yet again. Thursday comes along, and my tracking is updated. ""En route to FedEx office tomorrow, 6/23."" I again call the support line, and they contact the shipping facility. They told me that that shipping facility had already had many problems, which went ignored, because on time delivery isn't their priority. They said that they have the package still there, and it's sitting on the shelf. I ready to punch a hole through my wall. I am currently writing this on Thursday, 6/22, and still do not have my shipment. This is unacceptable that a package sits in a facility 5 miles from the destination for business days. I've been given empty apologizes with no result, and needless to say, I will never give my business ever again. Also, a package shipped USPS First Class from the same website, that was shipped 4 days later, arrived today, 6/22. Ridiculous. "	0	2

First you put two standart size Toasts into the toaster and toast them for 3 toasty minutes.

Then you take your knife and cut up a bananna into at least 9 ~3cm thicc slices. Then take the toasts out the toaster and apply a 0.3cm thicc layer of nutella to each of the slices of toasty toast.

To finish up you arrange the bananna slices into a 3x3 grid onto one of the slices and put the other toastbon too so that you have toast&gt;nutella&gt;bananna&gt;nutella&gt; toast.

Trying to understand the RDN token sale process. Let me just start by saying that their use of Dutch auction was absolutely smart and cool. Reading their token contracts is a true pleasure. Probably the simplest token contract I've been able to find.

I read on the Solidity website that each contract can have exactly one constructor, i.e. constructor overloading isn't allowed in Solidity.  Looks like RaidenToken has a constructor that takes 3 arguments here: https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden-token/blob/master/contracts/token.sol#L218

Then how is the DutchAuction contract calling it with a single argument of the deployed RaidenToken contract address here? https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden-token/blob/master/contracts/auction.sol#L160

Same thing is happening in their deploy code that runs on the test network: https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden-token/blob/master/deploy/deploy_testnet.py#L134

Is this a special case of the contract constructor? Or is this a static function that I'm just not aware of? What does it do?"	7	5

Info: 21 M, 240 Lbs 5'11"", Knee (began today). Taking no meds, have only one other incident bone injury, fracturing my toe in middle school

I felt a bit tired this afternoon so to get more energy I took a run outside. This was after I'd been sitting for an hour, so my legs were still kind of stiff. After I finished running I then jumped in the air and landed on my feet hard 6 or 7 times. Imagine a normal jump, but landing forcefully down on your feet in a big stomp. Afterwards my knee started to sting a bit, but I could still walk on it no problem. But as I hung out with my friends that night, as the night went on, my knee started to hurt worse and worse. Now I'm limping around the house, ready to go to bed. 

I don't know what it'll feel like when I wake up. It's very stiff, but it feels worse than a little normal knee pain. As I'm sitting here I can fully flex the knee up and down with little to no pain. When I get up there's little pain as long as I don't put too much weight on it. When I walk around the house it's very stiff and kinda numb. The knee looks perfectly normal, no bruises or anything. It just feels really off and I have a feeling it may be more serious than I suspect. Any help would once again, mean a lot."	2	0

They have been taking out the proper amount, which is for myself and a dependent. So essentially, due to a clerical error w/ my employer, I have been paying for my daughter to have insurance and she was not covered. Do I have grounds to ask for reimbursement? If denied (the CEO is notoriously cheap), do I have legal grounds to go after said reimbursement? I want to know what I am entitled to before I approach my HR department.

My missus has started watching and enjoying love island and is now trying (and somewhat failing) to convince me to watch it. But from what I've read, it doesn't look like my kind of show.


We usually have the same taste in TV shows, to point where neither of us has our ""own"" show, because it quickly becomes ""our"" show because we'll both happily watch it.


I don't usually like Big Brothery type shows, but she says it has a certain charm etc etc that BB was lacking.

a specific example: my partner went to a PT that happened to be a woman. the idea of this woman touching my partner's body, in a professional setting, made me well up with weird possessive, angry feelings, like i couldn't even hear what they were saying, I was just imagining another woman touching them and freaking out internally. I interrupted my partner telling me about their exercises to say, ""I don't want you to see her again"" and got angry and pouty, and my partner was just like ""Whoa, where is this coming from?!"" all I could muster was ""I don't know but I hate it!"" It is mortifying to know that I said that/felt that way. But those feelings keep randomly popping up.

This kind of thing has never bothered me before, these women are not a threat to our relationship, partner is doing nothing wrong... so what is the deal? I've always joked about straight girls being jealous/possessive, and I'm starting to go from joke-worried to actually-worried this is a symptom of the shift in our relationship dynamic? Was some weird straight  fem gene turned on when my partner told me they were considering changing their gender? Haha but also Yikes! I'm sure it has more to do with our relationship moving into new territory and that feeling of uncertainty is making me extra cautious and anxious. No matter the reason, it is becoming a burden on my conscience. I don't feel comfortable sharing these feelings with my partner, because they are doing nothing wrong, and I don't want them to feel, on top of everything else, that they need to minimize their interactions with supportive community at the gym, at work, at the doctor's office, etc.

Any tips from the occasionally jealous among us on coping with this terrible new set of feels?"	25	12

im learning chinese with the book ""practical Chinese Reader 1"" which im pretty much through with. I have the two following books of the series but the ""book learning"" is pretty boring to me.

I dont want to give it up but rather find a supplement to it.

I have the vocabulary down and was wondering wether it is enough to get started with switching my phone or notebook os' language to chinese.

Quickly realising that its a bit far fetched to make that leap from my existing vocabulary I was wondering how others get started with switching device languages to chinese.

Any tips how i should start?

Is there a vocabulary list for words used in an OS like Windows or iOS?

We broke up a couple weeks ago. Since, she has texted me daily. Either telling me that she's over me and letting me go, or spilling onto me everything that was ""great"" about our relationship that she won't let slip from her. She keeps pressuring me into talking to her and answering questions I don't want to answer. I'm starting to put my foot down but she isn't having it. I feel like she's trying to guilt me back into dating her. I don't know what to fucking do.

She complains how she won't eat. She won't sleep. She has no friends besides me. I'm actually losing my fucking mind right now, I thought breaking up with her would help me but I'm starting to wish I had just never fucking said anything and I know that's not healthy

Before anyone says it, I will not block her. I cannot block her for personal reasons. And it's not because I'm scared to, it's an actual valid reason that I would rather not share.

She's also depressed. I'm so fucking scared she is going to hurt herself"	0	22

- OP's friend (20F) sleeps with a good looking misogynistic guy (20M)

- Comments call OP asshole

I doubt this story is real tbh, but the comments treat it as such. So I pose this to you - is it not cognitive dissonance to try to claim to be feminist, yet push aside such beliefs to sleep with openly sexist men? It's the same as someone who hates Trump then sleeping with 'hot' Trump supporters, knowing fully well what they believe in.

I cannot reconcile feminist beliefs with this behavior."	11	66

眼睛是心靈的窗戶，自然需要漂亮美麗。但是人到一定年紀，一旦有眼袋了，就可能顯得人非常沒精神。那麼怎麼能去掉這煩人的眼袋呢？

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/edy6jlgw6ef31.jpg

怎樣快速去眼袋？去眼袋的方法有哪些？和美詩沁小編一起來瞭解一下去眼袋的相關問題。想要瞭解這些問題，我們先來看一下什麼是眼袋？

眼袋，就是下眼瞼浮腫，由於眼瞼皮膚很薄，皮下組織薄而鬆弛，很容易發生水腫現象，從而產生眼袋。眼袋的形成有諸多因素，遺傳是重要因素，而且隨著年齡的增長愈加明顯 。

一般來講，成年人，尤其是女性，在25～30歲之間就會生出眼袋。這多半是脂肪堆積的結果。最好的解除辦法，就是將其徹底去除。有的人認為自己眼袋不算太明顯，總是想等到眼袋再大一些的時候再去除，此觀念是錯誤的，其結果必將是下眼瞼皮膚過早鬆弛。

去眼袋的方法

冷敷消腫

冷敷的方法可以有效的幫助我們去除眼袋，每天晚上可以用冰塊裹著毛巾放在眼睛上，堅持使用的話是可以幫助我們成功去除眼袋的。

使用眼霜或眼膜

有許多眼霜和眼膜有淨白和滋潤的效果，塗眼霜的時候配合一些輕柔的眼部按摩，效果更好，堅持下去的話在一定程度上是可以去除眼袋的。

多吃水果蔬菜

多吃水果蔬菜對於眼袋的緩解也是有一定的作用的，另外要注意的是飲食需要清淡一點，不要吃太鹹或者太刺激的食物。

常喝菊花茶

菊花中的一些成分對緩解眼睛疲勞、視力模糊有很好的療效。經常用菊花茶包敷眼睛的話是有助於緩解眼袋的。

怎樣快速去眼袋

瞭解了這些基礎常識，我們再來看怎樣快速去眼袋？

[美詩沁](http://bit.ly/2X180GH)一次性不開刀去眼袋技術是最新的去眼袋技術，該方法採用高科技溶脂器，結合美韓最先進創新科技，通過微分子模仿細胞運動規律改變運動速度，使眼袋內脂肪熱效溶解吸收，從而達到去除眼袋的目的。

也是[美詩沁](http://bit.ly/2X180GH)的獨家技術，通過國際專利儀器與操作者精湛技術的完美結合，從而保證既能徹底去除眼袋又能達到沒有疤痕的效果。

早在2000年其他醫美機構都在研究如何精進傳統的開刀去眼袋手法的時候，[美詩沁](http://bit.ly/2X180GH)已經開啟了不開刀去眼袋技術的研究。到現在24年的不斷努力，不開刀去眼袋技術已經到了國際一流水準。

[OC] Thomas made his first sexual experiences

After a long day of exhausting work on the tracks Thomas finally arrived back at the train station when he saw Gordon steaming down his way. Thomas looked confused ,as Gordon ,to which he spoke rarely, drove his way down to him. 
„Can I do something for you?“, asked Thomas shyly while keeping his eyes on Gordon.  
„I don’t know, can you?“ Gordon responded, while slowly approaching Thomas.
„I don’t know what this is, this whole situation makes me  uncomfortable.“, Thomas stated while slowly driving backwards.
„Oh you don‘t have to be uncomfortable“, Gordon wheezed while nearing Thomas even more, „Uncle Gordon is here to make you feel very good“, he said with a cheeky smile. 
Thomas couldn’t back up further, the rail ended directly behind him. „Please Gordon, I don’t want to do this“ he whispered in tears while pushing his back against the end of the rails.
„Just be quiet and it will be over in just a minute“, replied Gordon, slowly turning Thomas  around. Thomas was shaking violently, full of anguish, as Gordon was opening his carbon-granule chamber with his massive, strong wheels. Thomas cried out in pain as Gordon was pushing his gigantic piston into his small coal chamber. „Shut your damn mouth“ Gordon yelled at him while simultaneously pushing one of his wheels on Thomas‘ mouth. Gordon pushed harder and harder moaning in lust while little tears ran down Thomas‘ cheeks. After a for Thomas infinite seeming two minutes, Gordon moaned violently and squirted a huge amount of black, oily substance into Thomas‘ coal chamber.

I’ve talked to and sent my CV to recruitments and my previous job was found by REED, who I am still with. 

Meeting with another recruitment company next Monday. 

I’m looking for roles that are entry level to banking, or just even retail (which I can’t seem to get, sent out a lot of CVs and I have retail experience). 

My experience ranges from hospitality, retail, customer service, and specialised industry role (though difficult to find in London). 

For retail jobs, would you recommend going into a mall for example and handing in my CV? Didn’t get much feedback from online at all. 

Any advice would be appreciated!"	2	1

It is a rectangular image. When i bring it into Zbrush (import into alphas) the preview shows the image correctly. However when i try to actually use it, the alpha gets cut off by a circle - imagine you take a rectangular piece of dough, and you put a cup on top of it, that cup makes a circular hole in the dough. The dough is my alpha, and the cup is the circle. Essentially anything outside this ""circle"" gets cut off, and isnt used by Zbrush.

I've looked at every possible setting, no luck. 

For reference, this is the image (from another program - not zbrush) i found on internet that shows my exact problem with how alpha gets cut off: https://3dcoat.com/forum/uploads/monthly_2017_05/5915b3019a18f_2017-05-12(2).thumb.png.fd6e743ae577faee8585fece211cb7a7.png

I've been looking around this subreddit to find out more information about programmatic vendors that we've been considering running with. And since the landscape is pretty up and down right now, we've been pretty careful.

Which is why I'm kinda surprised that when we decided to test FuelX, things have been actually going pretty well so far.

To be totally honest, the only reasons we gave them a shot was because we had leftover budget this month and they had a much lower minimum than other vendors. So we figured why not throw them a bone.

But so far it's been pretty good working with them.

They're driving a modest 1.9x ROAS. Not the best but we're happy with that considering the portion of our overall marketing budget that they represent.

However, I've been really impressed with are their reps/AMs. They've been really hands-on and are as transparent as I've ever experienced (which not gunna lie is very refreshing). And I think their perspective on using deterministic attribution rather than probabilistic is interesting.

So in light of the negative things I've seen on here about them, I don't know if it's the fact that they've changed their platform and hired a new team (both of which I confirmed with a friend of a friend of someone on their team) but things seem to have changed for the better.

Curious to see if anyone has been pitched by them recently or have worked with them recently?

I'll keep you all updated as things progress. We'll see if the success continues."	0	0

She laughed the hardest at stuff I say, smiles a lot at me and to stuff I say. She said hi when she saw me ask what's up. We had to do peer reviews and she came to my table sat next to me at my table. She sat between me and a woman Im friends with, talked to her she said something, smiled at me and looked deep into my eyes and didn't stop smiling and it felt awkward, if I didn't break the eye contact she probably would've continued. She was making forced eye contact and scratching her head while resting her head on her hand. One day I sat down waiting for class and sat with a woman I give a lot of attention to in class and she came in for class walked over and started waiting very close to me, hovering over standing in my personal space, she walked right in front of me and started getting close to me and I could smell her but she had her back to me. This was the closest she's been to me. There was a whole room not a lot of other people. When I talked about another girl that likes me that I don't like and asking for advice from a woman I talk to in college to not lead her on. She joined the conversation said that the other girl will continue pushing and I have to ignore all together and tell her I'm not interested. This was the biggest response I got from her and longest convrsation. She started this stuff after I asked for advice, . I told her someone said my hair looks like the clown from it and she said that's not nice. I saw her in the hall one day we stopped seeing each other in class. She saw me and stopped and asked me how my classes were this semester and she had the biggest smile on her face. I ask her stuff and it's like she has a hard time with conversation but has the biggest smile on her face talking to me. I said my advisor would kick me out bc he knows I smoke pot and she says ""awww"" I do get an awkward forced vibe from her 
. I can tell she's the shy conservative type of girl


I crossed paths walking on a small walkway and she didn't look me in the eye was looking down and said hey very softly, unassertively. we had to go to a lecture in the biggest lecture hall on my campus. I was sitting in a spot in the front and in the middle and she came in saw me and she came in and sat 2 empty seats away from me. 2 days ago I approached her, told her I miss seeing her in English and would like to stay in touch and asked for her number she said yeah sure and gave it to me no hesitation. I got an awkward vibe from her though I could tell she was nervous when confronted. 

I texted her Wednesday at 7 and said hi and introduced myself she she didn't respond until after school at 4 Thursday. She texted back hey Joe. I told her I would like to get to know her and asked if she would like to do it over text or phone. She said whatever works for me and I asked if she could talk on the phone tonight. She didn't respond to that. It was almost 9. Well I texted her yesterday at noon asking her how her summer was and she hasn't got back to me. Before you make assumptions, her family is from a different country a different culture and they aren't into social media or their phones as much. Like she only has 197 friends and doesn't use social media as much as everyone else.

We own a home with little to no equity and have joint debt.

Some time ago, my spouse used my christmas bonus to pay for car repairs (I consented) and then they began discussions of buying a new car. Since both would be paying for the car payment, we agreed to hold off until we had a decent down payment and could find a good deal; however, a month or so later, on my way home, my spouse called from a dealership asking me to come in and cosign a on a new car. I reluctantly agreed to go and, against my better judgement I agreed to put my name on the car (I'm a push over). What my spouse did was absolutely wrong and I'm bitter about it to this day but, I agreed and so, I understand I am responsible. Is it possible to have my name removed from the car in a divorce? Currently, they are working on refinancing but, due to a bankruptcy before marriage they need a cosigner and, since they've burned all their bridges with many other people this may not be a viable option.

As far as the house is concerned, I could likely keep it if the car is off my credit report and, since there is little equity, I'm wondering if I would owe the spouse anything? There isn't any way the house could be refinanced in their name due to bankruptcy and debt so, its either sell it or, it gets refinanced in my name. Do I have a choice in that matter?

I took out a personal loan to pay off the spouse's credit card debt and create a nest egg since our savings was wiped out to pay for the car's taxes. The loan is only in my name and, any money put into savings came directly from my paychecks. Is my spouse legally entitled to half the savings? Is my spouse obligated to pay for the part of the loan used for their credit cards or is that now only my responsibility?

So far, we are only separated and the spouse is staying elsewhere while I'm now solely responsible for the household bills. So far, it hasn't been contentious though the spouse is trying to win me back. I'm afraid once it completely sinks in that its over that could change as they have taken advantage of and treated ex's and friends poorly in the past.

I haven't spoken with a lawyer but, I'm afraid I need to as their agreeableness may just be them stringing me along.

What are my options? If negotiating with the spouse breaks down, is bankruptcy to relieve me from the car and personal loan debt the only option? I want to keep the house but, understand that may not be possible.

Feel free to ask any questions that may help you answer my concerns.

Thanks for reading."	3	2

Their relationship annoyed the crap out of me until part 2 of season 6.  Mr PB was obviously making bad decisions to distract himself from being lonely, and Pickles just annoyed me in general.  Obviously the way they handled PB's infidelity was toxic and only going to crash and burn.  I expected it to go so much worse, with PB falling to a rock bottom of his own.

But then, I was pleasantly surprised.  While never outright confirming that Pickles and Joey Pogo got together, it's heavily implied that she found someone who was a better fit for her.  She found a great opportunity, and Mr. PB was supportive and let her go, even though he knew he was sending her into the arms of someone else.  And afterwards, instead of spiralling, he was finally ready to be on his own instead of chasing after another doomed relationship.  He was ready to figure out who he was and what he wanted.  

After a shit show of a relationship, I didn't expect their ending to be so good.

**Diane &amp; Guy**

There was a brief moment when Diane and PB were talking on the phone about how much they'd changed that I thought they might push her back together with him.  But then they didn't.  And Diane was talking to Bojack on the roof calling him her at-the-time boyfriend.  I thought for sure they'd broken up.  But they got married.  And it makes me so happy that Diane found her happiness, and she found someone good for her that made her feel like an ""us"".  She found someone who loved and understood her and only wanted to support her.  It was a stark contrast between her relationship with PB, who she was with for the same reasons he was with her.  She was afraid of being alone, and she was just trying to find happiness, but couldn't figure out how.

I'm proud of Diane for doing some of the things she was afraid to do in order to find her happiness.  The medication, Ivy Tran, moving to Houston.  Those were all hard decisions to make, but ultimately, she made the hard choices and found herself in a better life because of it.  Life doesn't always turn out how you planned/dreamed, and it can be hard to let go of.  But your plans might not be what's best for you.

**Todd &amp; Maude**

Gosh, they were so cute.  I was so happy to see Todd stop aimlessly following everyone else's life and finally build his own.  He found a good partner.  He got his own place.  Started a successful job.  Rekindled his relationship with his mother.  It took a lot of time, but he found his way without having to fundamentally change himself.

**Princess Carolyn &amp; Jonah**

This one hit me out of left field a little bit.  I was always kind of hoping that Ralph would come back and they'd live happily ever after.  But, this was better.  Jonah is so well suited for her, and once they started going that direction, I was all in.

It was an important reminder for me, too, since I recently got out of a relationship that I thought was perfect for me and would last forever.  Sometimes, no matter how good a relationship seems, or how strong the bond was, or how serious you were able to get, it still just isn't the right relationship for you.  It may have been at the time, but it was a piece of your growth.  The past becomes the past, and even if it doesn't necessarily seem like it, there's someone more suited for you in your future.

**Overall**

I think the tie ups of a lot of the relationships in this show were handled so well and in a fairly healthy way.  I think it displayed a lot of growth for a lot of people.  Good reminders for the things we are going through on our own.

Bojack Horseman was a masterpiece, and it's a shame Netflix cut it so soon.  This show was raw and unafraid to look at issues that affect us and might not be talked about.  It really was one of a kind."	84	5

4.) I take 1 20 mg XR tablet everyday and have been for maybe 7-8 months or so. This means I must have some sort of a tolerance, do you think that it will still work for me?

Those are usually not legit reviews just because it doesn't highlight the features of the app and two it helps the bad apps out. Google Play should start deleting these kind of reviews as it skews the data. I have found a horrible case of this with the Pokemon Home app which has been reviewed by many people as a horrible app because of the features locked behind an expensive paywall. Well just look at these images and you can't tell me I am lying or being stupid after seeing this. I think TheQuartering has discussed about Sword and Shield before and this is yet another saga of this. If all these fake reviews were removed the app would get less than a 2-2.5 which would make more sense for this app than around a 4.

All Circled ones are definitely fakes or lack of actual review. I also mark ones that are Real and not Fake and the Irrelevant reviews. Google needs to take down the Circled ones and the Irrelevant reviews because otherwise bad apps will get higher score than they should. I've also seen this with Lucky Go and other variants of it because all I see for real reviews are mostly that you never earn $10 to checkout for paypal and many ads too (many ads is normal but it still counts).

When I'm an everyday guy I look at women and think about being with them. I crossdress also and when I look at guys I wonder what their cock looks like, tastes like, and feels like. When I dress I consider myself a woman. And I like to be treated as one. I don't even think about my penis. In fact I kinda push it out of my mind. When I'm with a guy, I don't really get an erection unless he's inside me and hitting the right spots. And if he's the right size 7.5+ then I will get an erection and sometimes I will orgasm. Then and only then I recognize my penis. Other than that I don't think about it. When I'm dressed as a woman I only like to be with guys, I feel heterosexual also. When I'm with a woman as a guy, I feel heterosexual too. I am not understanding what is going on. As a woman I am the exact opposite of when I'm a guy. As a guy I am dominant and like to control, when I am a woman I am submissive and like to be controlled. When I dress, I dress like what I as a guy would think is sexy. I'm just kinda confused and wanted to see if anyone had some insight. I don't think of myself as gay, is that weird?	9	4

A problem I have experienced, and I have seen in many forums with no solid answer, is the audio fading to almost nothing and then sometimes coming back a little but basically rendering the built in speakers un-usable.

I tried the below before this fix;

-Install latest realtek drivers
-Disable Nvidia virtual audio
-Uninstall and reinstall latest realtek drivers
-Try older realtek drivers
-Disable spacial sound
Probably also other fixes that I cant remember, I essentially trawled all the forum posts I could find and tried every single thing that applied to me, even some HP forums.

I found an ASUS programme pre-installed called ""sonic studio 3"" launching this, there is a setting called ""sonic studio effects"" this was on... I turned this off, immediately the problem of fading audio disappeared for me.
I also went into advanced settings and disabled ""device routing"" and ""sonic studio effects"" there too.

I would imagine that disabling/uninstalling this programme would have the same effect, however I have not done this..

So far, so good. I hope this works for anyone else experiencing this same annoying issue."	1	1

F/F, M/M or F/M!	https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtyr4r/comments/fwzk6t/21_f4a_melbourne_aus_submissive_with_a_weird_kink/	"Hi guys. I'm looking to do a gender swap roleplay with someone. I especially like F/M (you play a female, I play a male), but also enjoy F/F and some M/M at times as well. My weird is farting. Make of that what you will :-) You don't have to incorporate that, but the gender swapping aspect is a must. I'd prefer to roleplay over kik.

Some of the things I'm into in order of how interested I am in them:

\-Non-consensual roleplay

\-Farting

\-CBT if it is a F/M or M/M

\-For lack of a better word, extremely rough domination. Lots of hitting, slapping, kicking, punching, very physical stuff, edge play.

\-Watersports

\-Asphyxiation

\-All sorts of roleplay scenarios, e.g student/teacher, employee/boss, as long as they don't go too far into fantasy (for example I'm not into magical rp's, aliens, witches, etc).

If you're interested, send me a message on here and i'll get back to you! :-)

PS: I got a lot of messages on my last post from people confused about all this. To reiterate: I am a SUBMISSIVE. I will not play a dominant. This is not a meet up opportunity or opportunity to exchange pics - I am strictly looking to roleplay ONLINE. If you require it I can send a face pic as proof of my gender. Look forward to hopefully playing with some of you! :-)

I have my raspi set up as a VPN and Plex server. In my router's settings I am trying to forward the port for the VPN to my raspi and also the port for the Plex server to my raspi. I'd like to be able to access both easily from outside of my network. Whenever I add both port forward entries, one of them gets deleted when trying to save.

Are you not able to forward 2 different ports to 1 device or is this a limitation on my router's end?

Thanks!"	1	12	0.67

My friends know how to ride bikes and swim and I just feel so left out. My dad is trying to teach me and my sister (she's 9 and has training wheels so she's basically just zooming away on her bike) but I decided I didn't want the training wheels because I wouldn't want to be dependent on it. I could never seem to balance and pedal at the same time and my dad said he had to fall at least once to learn how to ride a bike but I don't want to get hurt.

As for swimming, my friends taught me to float on my back but I can only do it if it's in shallow water, and it's not swimming, it's just floating on your back. I've asked my parents for swimming lessons but last time we checked it was too expensive and obviously I can't do that if we're quarantined.

I know these are rooted in fear cause I'm just now getting introduced to these kinds of things due to me being sheltered a significant part of my life and it makes me so insecure. I wish I was athletic and not a coward."	1	10	1.0

I'm dealing with this issue now since a few months and didn't found any solution to this:

As bluetooth USB dongle I am using one from amazon which I've got for a few bucks.It's supporting BT 4.0 and low energy connections.

My headphones are the Apple AirPods 2nd generation.

When I switch from a fullscreen YT video to a borderless window game as e.x. Overwatch the headphones sound cut off. Sometimes it doesn't get cut off completely, in that case the sound of both headphones are getting async. In both cases it just helps, to reconnect the headphones to the PC.

I have already tried another USB dongle from Amazon and an ASUS PCIe Card (which was also connected to USB headers of my mainboard).

Have you ever had such problems? If so, how did you solve them?"	1	1	1.0

It gives you 10,000% bonus to your Primary Attack Damage. This is only buffs your hungering arrow, bolas, entangling shot, and evasive fire. While I think that is great and all the Natalyas Set gives you a 14,000% Increased damage buff (not specific to your primary abilities). So currently my build is 5 piece set Natalyas and 3 piece set Gear Of Deadlands. Using the ring of Royal Grandeur i can recieve the damage bonus from the Natalyas 6 piece set and also the Gears of dreadlands 4 piece set. Natalyas 2 piece reduces cooldown of the rain of vengence whenever you hit with a hatred gen or hatred spending attack. So while using strafe 4 pieces you use your primary attack while strafing getting to double down on your cdr for rain of vengence. Now the 4 piece set natalya isnt important but after 6 piece bonus you get 14,000% damage and reduce your damage by 60% after you use rain of vengence. As stated before you can get nearly 2 second uptime using strafe. There is also a defence aspect to the build which is quite nice as well. Natalyas gives you a nice 60% damage reduction as well as an additional 60% when you use your strafe and for 5 sec after. If you combine with Wraps of Clarity for 50% damage reduction, Elusive ring when you use your shadow power for 60% damage reduction and finally an 35% while shadow power is up you get WHOPPING 265% DAMAGE REDUCTION. Now you lose out on a couple things. This build no longer uses restraint and Focus. Not sure how much the damage is affected as well as not using a different X-bow you have to use the natalyas set bow. As i am now with no primals, i can play on torment 16 with ease and clear GR 80.

(TX)	https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/i6ixna/offenders_family_filing_cps_allegations_in/	A couple months ago my nieces (11f and 12f) made an outcry against their cousin (14m). All of that is still in process with the court system. When new cases are opened CPS checks everyone’s home and my sisters home was cleared. Now after multiple threats from the girl’s uncle and ex wife, we get call from another family member saying that they have called CPS and said they have a dirty home. This is untrue. The ex wife who is the mother of the offender has been calling around looking for “dirt” on the girls and their parents. I am afraid this is only going to get worse. That to protect this boy from what he has done they will use any means necessary to intimidate the girls. Is there anything we can do? We are already planning on calling the detective on Monday but would like to find a way to get them to stop. Thank you for any help you can provide.	0	4	0.25

I have always looked up to more mature girls or or more dominant woman and I like being submissive. I enjoy relying on my female partner and being submissive emotionally and sexually. I’ve just never said that to anyone. I thought I’d be looked at as weird and there was no one that was into that type of thing. I’ve always thought guys are supposed to be strong, supportive, and masculine. However obviously that kinda changed as I’m here right now and I’m being truthful to myself and admitting that I’m not the stereotypical “man”.

Literally her mom will go get dinner for everyone else in the house the kids the husband except for my gf. It infuriates me and I wish there was something I could do. She’s 17 so idk if CPS is the right thing to do and she may get mad at me for inserting myself into the situation but she refuses to fight back or demand food. She’s already underweight and has an eating disorder and her mom is making it so much worse. What should I do? I buy dinner every time we’re out and it’s getting taxing on my bank account lol. Her mom needs to get her dinner this is ridiculous. It doesn’t help that she’s picky and never eats what’s in the house because “there’s nothing to eat” I’m just pissed I need help. Advice?

Edit: So I guess the general consensus here is that GF being picky is her fault and there’s nothing I can do but tell her to grow up. She doesn’t care that she’s underweight lol she wants to be skinnier she’s even getting a waist trainer. Women’s beauty standards is a whole other problem but anyways the mom will go out to eat most days and there’s usually not any food in the house if that changes anything. How would I go about talking to her about being less picky and maybe considering reaching out for help about her eating disorder?

Chapter 4 is up for my story! I've made previous posts on what it's about and how I'm writing it, but the short synopsis is I've taken a bunch of trope'd out, overdone or poorly done wish fulfillment ideas, combined them all into one and am trying to forge an interesting story out of it. Wish-fulfillment-but-not, I guess. I think I'm really getting somewhere with it (I wrote for like 4 hours straight last night because I was just in the zone and wrote far more than I intended), so I'm just looking for feedback and for people to point out any errors I made in the story. My bio holds all the author's notes/blogs for the stories, so if you want, you can also check those out for a behind the scenes look on how the story has developed and changed over time.

Some even suggest that at one point, the pursuit of wisdom was an Israelite-religion in its own right!  Such that through the pursuit of wisdom, and in contemplating some of the bigger questions about purpose in life, *just as much as* the reflections on the mundane, the day-to-day; That through this, we can learn how to live the Good Life.  

And ultimately encounter YHWH.

&amp;#x200B;

This is some of what I think about in this week's *Reflections on the Prophets.*  Today's entry is called *A Stroke of Brilliance* and can be found [here.](https://www.sefaria.org/sheets/286277.8?lang=bi&amp;with=all&amp;lang2=en)

There was just this crazy connection that I’ve never had with anyone else. Not even close. He would talk about it too. Neither of us ever knew how to fully explain it. It was like we knew each other in a past life. He felt like coming home.

Over the years, have both told each other “I love you” on multiple occasions, but never at the *right* time. There was always a timing problem. And always a refusal on both our parts to ever be truly and fully vulnerable. 

I re-realized I was in love with him in December of 2019. I didn’t tell him, because he was with someone else. 

In April, he texted me one night after seeing me, and told me how badly he wanted to come over to just hold me and kiss me. Then he told me he loved me. But he was drunk, and more importantly, he was still with someone else. So, I told myself he didn’t mean it, and I distanced myself from the friendship, telling myself to get over him. Spoiler: I didn’t. 

He and his girlfriend broke up a couple months ago, and as much as I wanted to confess my feelings, I felt that doing so would be selfish before he had time to grieve the loss of his relationship. I thought we could maybe start to be friends again, and see where it went from there. 

He killed himself a month later. 

He was my first love. He was the love of my life. And I can never tell him that. My heart is utterly broken, and the pain is beyond what I thought one human could tolerate. 

It’s been over a month now, and I just don’t know how to handle this. It’s too painful. And because we weren’t together, I don’t feel entitled to my grief. 

I don’t even know where to share my story. I feel so alone in this. Most people don’t know - you don’t exactly go around advertising that you’re in love with your friend who’s in a relationship with someone else. 

I’m so lonely. I need help."	10	2	1.0

For the most part, I've primarily played the game as NIN, but I never watched any guides (mostly because I couldn't understand the terminology), but as I talk to new friends who are more in depth with the combat systems, I'm wondering if I've been playing my class wrong, and making parties cringe during duties. Now, I don't intend to fine-tune and optimize my playstyle to perfection, but I'm just wondering if I'm playing bad.

Edit: I'm dumb and didn't put in my playstyle. When I play, I do the base nin combo, and try to put doton and feint on enemy. Then while I wait for cool down to refresh, I just try to damage the enemy as best as I can with remaining abilities.

I know now it’s not possible (and it’s probably better that way, poor Mat otherwise) but I found Kelly the most attractive based on personality (the few that we know about) and profile picture.  It would be very good if you could actually throw off your date and go to talk with Kelly after she broke up, and also learn why they broke up (bcause it’s not very developped imo).

Everyone lives with rations and such, scavenging and trying to survive in a (Maybe?) post-apocalypse setting. They were willing to eat rats and such to make up for food they needed outside the given rations. The main character - a girl I forgot the name of - likes to collect things and climb out in an area where there's fewer people. The government sets restrictions on how far citizens can go (I think) and won't allow them to keep certain items such as books. They got information through technology, which also monitored that they were there after curfew. Every day they go to work in factories to make parts of a machine. They had to wear masks some days because of the air quality. She meets a guy - Rose - when she's out collecting one day and he's the one who tells her about things that she can't learn where she lives, and he brings her a book that helps her imagine what things were like before half the population died. She and Rose are the main characters and they end up going against the government or something like that to try to restore the world. 

It was set in the future and I think it was a longer book? It was in english and I read it a few years back, not sure what the cover was like - I think my copy had just a plain hard cover, maybe a deep reddish brown? I don't recall if the title was on it so it may have been missing a sheet that went over the cover. I think it was either young adult or adult age level, not entirely sure, and we just found it in my mother's things so I don't know how old it was.

Edit + more details that could spoil the book a bit: I don't think they were children- I'm pretty sure Rose was experimented on to figure out more about him and their method of restoring the world was growing plants in a secret area.

## What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is decentralized advanced money that disposes of the requirement for middle people like banks and governments,  utilizing rather a distributed PC organization to affirm buys straightforwardly between clients.

Fiat cash (like the U.S. dollars in your financial balance) upheld and directed by the public authority that issues it.

[Bitcoin](https://shouts.site/what-is-bitcoin-and-how-does-it-work/), then again, fueled through a blend of distributed innovation — an organization of people, similar as the volunteer editors who make Wikipedia — and programming driven cryptography, the study of passing restricted intel that must be perused by the sender and recipient.

This makes a money upheld by code as opposed to things of actual worth, similar to gold or silver, or by trust in focal specialists like the U.S. dollar or Japanese yen.

## History of Bitcoin

Bitcoin dispatched in 2009 and viewed as the main digital currency. The idea of blockchain innovation had been examined in scholastic papers for quite a long time, yet a paper named “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” helped dispatch digital currency into the real world.

“What’s required is an electronic installment framework dependent on cryptographic confirmation rather than trust, permitting any two consenting partakers to execute straightforwardly with one another without the requirement for a confided in outsider,” composed Satoshi Nakamoto —   the alias the strange creator of the Bitcoin paper — in a white paper presenting the open-source innovation.

It progressed significantly from that point forward, presently acknowledged as installment by organizations like PayPal, Microsoft and Whole Foods.

The cost of one bitcoin has developed significantly. In April 2011, the cost was $1. By April 2021, it arrived at a record spot value drawing nearer $65,000 prior to sliding down. As of early July, bitcoin was exchanging a reach somewhere in the range of $32,000 and $35,000.

I have anxiety, cried to the littlest inconvenience and been afraid to talk, give an opinion about something as X will turn against me, whereas, before this happened, X agreed to everything. I try some days to joke around, but no feedback. I'm like a blank space.
A little info of the friendship we had was that of to a point where we stayed up until 5 am talking about our problems, we cried together. I helped a lot to cope on some problems in my friend's life, same for X, meaning it was the same effort on both sides. We even made a promise to grow up together to be better versions of ourselves and that's what I loved so much of our friendship.
  For what happened I asked for forgivness, and was said X needed time for the anger to pass, and I totally understand. But me telling the secret isn't the only reason X is distancing from me, this was only the moment that things changed between us.
 I have these really negative thoughts because of the way I grew up, ended up in depression and suicidal thoughts that changed my point of view. I am at a point where I have gotten low in terms of university, low on my perception of the world and I keep thinking I should just let go and be on my way alone because of my problems I don't want to hurt anyone. I have read about people being in this state and understood that it is not healthy for the others to be in the presence of such person, and wouldn't want to be around that person for myself either.
 For the past months we also made a new friend who is more positive, funny, a human with emotions unlike me. I saw that my bff was better with that person and began to slowly understand that my presence was no longer needed. I wasn't jealous, I just felt bad about myself having no positive aspects of my life. I felt bad that my bff couldn't enjoy life with me because of what I lack. I lack the ability to make jokes. I constantly overthink and turn a simple joke to a mocking of me. I am slow at understanding some things, clumsy. All these have been said to me since as long as I can remember and they are true. And for that I told X I was afraid to where our friendship was going because of what I was. So I need to let go so X can get the happiness X deserves.
  I don't want to be a deadweight. I want to change so badly. I really don't want to lose this person and our new friend (who is also being distant lately in contrast to a few weeks earlier). I feel like I will turn to the people I hate the most, who betray, are toxic and have severe attachment issues. I am aware that I need therapy, but for financial reasons I can't. 
 What angers me the most about myself is that my sibling and my other bff of more that 15 years have had the same problems like me, even worse ... but, unlike me, managed to pave their way to a better person. Meanwhile I feel like I'm complaining too much, I'm weak and still a child.

So far my steps to improve have been:
Overthinking less. Honestly this one was tough at first, but one day I fully achieved that and started living in the moment. Never felt so happy to be in the present.
 Keeping a gratitude journal. I have noticed that when I wake up with anxiety and write afterwards, things do seem a little more postive.
 Started painting again. This was my helping tool during depressive episodes.

... writing this also is helping a lot right now. 

Thank you for reading until this point. 
What I ask for is how can earn the trust my bff had for me and how can I be patient? 
I don't think bringing up the situation again is going to help, I want to leave it in the past as we talked enough when I asked for forgiveness. 
I just dream of being at a higher state of myself and it feels like I might just be a little impatient about it.

Thank you again, hope you have a good day!"	4	2	0.84

Special shout-out to the Walgreens website that requires you to input your phone number, the dates of your vaccine shots, and your favorite color before telling you that there's no tests anywhere near you. At least CVS has the dignity to give you the news upfront.

Anyway. How are people approaching this? Is there some secret aggregator website I haven't found yet? Does NH have a stockpile of at-home tests at pharmacies right over the border? More generally: wt actual f?

It gets 10mpg on a good day as well. It was given to me so I don’t complain.

I am eyeing the ‘02-‘06 model of Lexus LS. After reading a lot of reviews + watching a lot of videos, it seems like a very reliable car.

I am also eyeing a 2003 Acura CL Coupe. I love the body style, seems very comfortable and reliable for trips, has my tan leather, and is Asian. I have seen good examples of both cars around 10k which is my max. I plan to keep the car for 4+ years as I am attending grad school. Id prefer not to finance because insurance would be thru the roof, but I may have to at the 10k mark.

My boyfriend doesn't seem to understand BPD and also doesn't want to learn about it apparently.

I sent him this video: https://youtu.be/to5qRLRSS7g today, and I think he didn't even watch it. 
He told me that he just doesn't have ""space in his head for this kind of stuff"", and when I asked him if he's interested in my condition he just said no.

This really felt like a slap in the face.
I mean, this is a part of me, and it kinda felt like he has no space for ME in his head.
BPD is not who I am, but it affects me every single day of my life. 

I mean, it's kinda like he doesn't want to learn about my religion and culture because ""I am not Judaism."" I'm an individual person, right, but being jewish is still part of me that shaped me into the person I am today. So is BPD. I just feel he's being very disrespectful here. If he loves me he just can't pick and choose the parts of me he accepts. Either take the whole package or kiss my ass goodbye.

I really consider ending the relationship for this reason. I mean, it's not gonna be the last time he's acting ignorant towards me. I want someone that really cares about me and accept every part of me, the good and the bad. Do you think I'm over reacting?"	11	15	0.87

 Disappointed in Brother's Greed
Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2019
Color: YellowSize: Single*: TonerVerified Purchase
We've had this Brother all in one for almost 8 years for our business and this is the first time this has happened, but we purchased a defective Yellow cartridge that can't be returned. This is in large part due to the limited 3-month warranty but mostly due to the nature of Brother's built-in ""death button"" that renders cartridges useless before they are empty. I get the ""low toner"" alert sometimes MONTHS before the death button gets triggered.

At some point, I really DO have to buy a cartridge because I can't be caught flat-footed when a client needs documents printed. I never know if it's going to sit for a month or three before I really need it, and at $100+ per cartridge, I don't think it's unreasonable to squeeze as much toner out of a cartridge as possible.

If Brother (and other manufacturers) would stop this artificial termination nonsense, it might be easier to gauge when I need a new cartridge, for real. Then, I can purchase closer to the actual end, and if it's defective, be within the return/warranty window.

 Learn how to reset your Brother printer to get the rated toner capacity
Reviewed in the United States on April 11, 2014
Color: Black TonerSize: Single*: TonerVerified Purchase
My conclusion after messing around with non Brother refills and ""compatible"" cartridges: stay with original Brother cartridges to avoid long term problems with your printer.

As others have mentioned you do not get 6000 pages out of these toner cartridges if you rely on your Brother printer's ""toner empty"" messages. Brother implements a crude page counter method to determine when the cartridge is ""empty"". Usually there is still plenty of toner left, another 800 ... 1000 pages. So Google your printer model for instruction of how to reset this counter on your particular model and make you $ go further. You can easily see when the toner is really approaching empty in the printout quality. On a Brother MFC-9560: Open cartridge door, then push the clear and back buttons to bring up the reset menu. reset the counter for each of the K (black) ,C(yan), M(agenta) and Y(ellow) cartridges.

Are the original manufacturer toner prices rip-offs? Absolutely, after all they follow the marketing model Mr Gillette already developed over a century ago: give away the razor (printer) for (almost) free and charge an arm and a leg for low material cost replaceables. But I've tried toner refills and ""compatible"" cartridges from various companies and while they might perform good initially, long term they lead to problems.(toner spill inside the machine, clogged toner path, etc...). So for me it is not worth the ""savings"".

 90 day warranty on toner cartridges can waste your money.
Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2018
Color: Black TonerSize: Single*: TonerVerified Purchase
Brother's 90 day warranty on a genuine cartridge sucks. After 30 minutes on the phone verifying I had purchased a genuine cartridge they would not replace or refund their own defective, leaking cartridge because I was a few weeks out of warranty. The unit sat on a shelf for about 4 months before being installed...that's all.

IF YOU EVER EXPERIENCE A DEFECTIVE CARTRIDGE AND IT'S BEEN MORE THAN 90 DAYS, TRY PURCHASING A REPLACEMENT FOR YOURSELF AND THEN USE THE NEW RECEIPT TO RETURN THE OLDER DEFECTIVE ONE.

Brother needs to do better. When their own product fails out of the box and they're unwilling to do anything about it simply because the cartridge sat unused on a shelf for 115 days that's pretty poor customer service. Why bother buying genuine if they're not there to help you? Wasted $100 and I'll keep it in mind for my next printer purchase.

 50% Fail Rate. 90-day Warranty. Do Not Stock Up.
Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2017
Color: Black TonerSize: Single*: TonerVerified Purchase
WARNING!! The quality of these toners are deteriorating. I've bought 3 brother printers over the years, and have always purchased original Brother toner cartridges through Amazon. In the past, I'd find a toner cartridge leaking a bit. I just cleaned up and moved on with my life. This time around, 2 (yellow and black) of the 4 toners leaked, spreading the colored particles all over the printer and onto the printed pages. That's 50% FAIL RATE - not acceptable by any quality manufacturer. When I called Brother, they told me this is a ""consumable product"" and would only provide warranty for products purchased within the last 90 days. Since I always buy a new one right after I have installed the previous one, mine may be sitting on my shelf (in original un-opened box and packaging) for 90 days before I open the package use it. By then, the warranty is already void. So, if you decide to put up with Brother's genuine but poor quality, DO NOT STOCK UP. Brother - You are welcome to contact me if you wish to address this quality issue professionals. Otherwise, you are losing my company's business for good.

 Toner leaks and only has a 3 month warranty
Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2016
Color: YellowSize: Single*: TonerVerified Purchase
This toner cartridge leaked all over the inside of my Brother MFC-9560CDW printer, and has resulted in vertical yellow bands printing on certain pages (depends on what colors are being printed). I cleaned the cartridge and printer the best I could, but it has continued to leak. When I remove the cartridge and turn it upside down, yellow powder comes flying out. Brother tech support was OK. They got me as far as confirming that the cartridge is bad, but also confirmed that it is out of warranty, which is only 3 months. Although I purchased the toner about a year and half ago, it has been sitting on my shelf, unopened and unused, until a few months ago. I noticed some powder leaking almost immediately, but ignored it for a while hoping it just needed to get broken in. Nope. So, basically, I'm screwed. If I had this sort of problem with a cheapie cartridge, I'd be saying, ""That's what I get for buying a cheapie cartridge instead of the name brand - lousy product and they don't stand behind it."" Lessons learned - don't purchase toner until I am really come close to needing it, and don't assume that just because I am buying the name brand, the product will be good and will be supported by the manufacturer. I just reordered another toner cartridge on Amazon, but I decided to go with a cheapie with good reviews.

Hey guys,

&amp;#x200B;

With the current economic and political situation, everything is so messed up. It seems that it's not the best time for beginners like me to enter a new market because everything is incredibly uncertain. No one knows what's going to happen next.

&amp;#x200B;

Nevertheless, I still want to dive into trading. Although the investment market is reigned by chaos now, I think this is exactly the time you can become a millionaire if you invest in the right company. I've read a couple of articles and tips on [https://www.independentinvestor.com/share-dealing/stock-trading-tips/](https://www.independentinvestor.com/share-dealing/stock-trading-tips/), but I think I've only scratched the surface of the knowledge I actually need. As far as I know, the shares price depends on several factors. One of them is the prospects of the company. I keep reading on different news sources that worldwide companies such as Apple are shutting down their production and trade points in Russia. Although they have noble intent, I can't help thinking that it'll affect their sales in the near future. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, the prices per share seem to go up for many US-based companies who dropped Russia. Can you explain to me please how it's possible? Maybe it hasn't been enough time for the market to react to these changes, and I'm just looking too far?

&amp;#x200B;

Another moment is that I read almost everywhere that people suggest buying Russian-companies stock. Their shares are sold for 1 cent now, and I don't know if it's even possible for them to go even lower. Is there any hope that their shares will go up at some point in the distant future? Or will those companies be buried forever?

&amp;#x200B;

I'd be very grateful for any tips or advice on the companies worth investing in in the long perspective. Many thanks to everyone who read this far."	21	23	0.92

对于中共在俄乌战争中的角色到底如何定位，目前存在各种说法。有的人认为，中共正在甩掉俄罗斯，有的人认为中共表面应付，不会给俄罗斯以实质帮助。旅澳大陆自由派法学家袁红冰却认为，“中共正在全力支持俄罗斯”。他说，中俄两方都在互相支持。袁红冰透露，从中共内部传出信息，现在连俄罗斯的一些口粮都是中共给的，军队物资是临时紧急调拨的。俄罗斯已经被西方逼到与北京一起，成为战略上“不封顶”的关系。

他说，俄罗斯前线的那些部队很多都与中共厂商有联系，中共给俄罗斯制造军需品，各种军粮，俄罗斯军粮最近相当一部分是在中国东北地区制作的。

如果俄罗斯外汇体系遭到国际制裁，袁红冰说，卢布跟人民币会更密切合作，到了最后，以物换物都有可能。为了避免美国找到借口，他会以物换物。

因为俄罗斯需要中共的各种轻工业产品，而中共也需要俄罗斯的能源、粮食，“中共紧急给俄罗斯调集了大批的制成品，俄罗斯有的是粮食，关键是运不出来，粮食生的你怎么吃啊。”

前首都师范大学副教授李元华也说，“满洲里那边已经忙得不得了，中共有大量物资运到俄罗斯，二十四小时都是这种状态，实际上中共是在暗中支持俄罗斯，希望俄罗斯站到自由世界对立面。”

“他不敢真正地去堂而皇之的跟西方作对，所以就摆出这么一个姿势，暗地里支持俄罗斯，给俄罗斯输送物品。”他说。

至于中共为何要力挺俄罗斯？袁红冰表示，“中共的真实意图，就是通过共产极权主义全球扩张，成为国际法的立法者、国际秩序的确定者，取代美国的国际警察的地位。”

“习近平曾在中共内部明确说，要以共产主义文化为核心价值构建人类命运共同体，取代美国和其它西方国家强加给这个世界的国际秩序。”

这就是习近平的总体的国家战略目标，他现在所做的一切都是围绕着这个国家战略目标来进行的。“而且他们有一个基本判断，就是东升西降，中共正在不断的崛起，而美国在衰落的趋势。”

俄罗斯尽管经济上很衰败，但是它毕竟有世界上最大的核武库，空军极其强大，“更重要的是俄罗斯的能源，石油和天然气，以及农产品，会弥补中共在这两个领域的战略物资储备的不足。”

“现在中共极力想和俄罗斯搞好关系，让俄罗斯成为他的能源基地。”据国际能源组织数据显示，去年中共进口占俄罗斯原油出口的20%。

中共已经开始扩大地下油库建设了，据内部消息，中共现在准备大量的修建油库。先把石油作为战略储备物资买回来，防止将来发动台海作战时，海上运输线被切断。

所以，中共期待的是，“由俄罗斯巨大的能源储备来解决中共自己战略能源储备不足的问题。为他发动台海作战，创造一个安全的能源后方基地。”

周五，俄罗斯军队似乎在重新集结，准备对基辅进行新一轮的攻击。

李元华认为，中共是希望俄乌打得越热闹越好。因为此前整个西方社会一直追究中共在大疫情爆发的责任及病毒的来源，突然来个俄乌战争，把注意力全吸引走了，所有火力全引开了。

对于中俄的合作，袁红冰说，所谓中共为了求自保要和俄罗斯拉开距离等，完全不存在这个问题。

“中共现在全部注意力就在于对外政策，在中共二十大后，拜登2024年下台前，发动台海作战。就像这次俄罗斯发动对乌克兰作战一样。”

中共并不担心制裁，他说，“早在六四后邓小平就说得很清楚，制裁过两天就过去了，经济制裁没有那么了不起。”

对于西方媒体很少报道中共是幕后黑手，他说，“第一，他们对中共还抱着一个绥靖主义的态度。现在拜登政府那些主要官员布林肯，还有国安秘书长，全是过去执行绥靖主义的主要干将。”

袁红冰指出，“他们对中共总是抱着幻想。前几天从布林肯到法国和德国的总理、外长还要求北京来制止俄罗斯侵略。多么愚蠢！”

I came across BS about a year ago. I tried listening to a couple files, but due to an awkward schedule and minor lack of motivation, I stopped listening after only a few days of the files. Ever since then I’ve been reading posts on this subreddit about people who have actually gone through with it and I can’t help but feel a bit jealous. I have begun to find the prospect of becoming Bambi and having an alternate personality living inside me so incredibly hot, I don’t know what else to do except start up on it and commit. I know that I currently have a few complications that might impede my adventure. First, I don’t know how much privacy I will have in the near future, as my living arrangements will be changing and I might be sharing a common space with another person. I wouldn’t want them to walk in on me mid session. Also, I don’t know if I have the current funds or means to purchase a real uniform. I guess I could try a minor thing that could be relatively unnoticed, but I don’t have any ideas for that. I guess what I’m saying is that I would love some advice and encouragement to finally make a real start into BS and embrace the slutty bimbo inside of me.

Thanks for reading,

A future (hopefully) Bambi"	6	4	1.0

We see people going on dates at cafes/parks etc, but we're not cut out for this, I mean it's boring and tiresome to us, and both of us work full-time so we want to relax on weekends. And for how many times one can go out just for the sake of eating. 

The best mutually agreed upon right now is ""We wish anyone of us had a flat, where we could have drank beer, smoke Js, and watched movies"". Well she does happen to live in a flat, but it's fucked up, she lives with her cousin, and occasionally her parents drop in on her. Now the arrangement with her cousin is temporary, and hopefully she'll be independent by the end of this year. 

But I really want to make things work with her, I don't want to bore her out, and which might lead to some problem in future, both of us are aware of this.

By this I mean being iconic, alluring and and more memorable, but not necessarily more valuable. I'll discuss the last bit later on. It boils down to four things - beauty, brains, confidence, and nonchalance. I'll breakdown what I mean by each one and how it makes up its part of the IT factor.

Beauty:

This would mean reaching your potential through looksmaxxing. Discovering what works for you in improving yourself aesthetically. Although I understand the women on this sub believe in objective beauty I think we can agree that there are at least different types of beauty. Figure out what works for you, and just don't neglect yourself. I'm not going to list beauty tips because there are so many resources on it on here. I also feel that it would be repetitive to say beauty adds to allure on this sub, but that is it's part in the IT factor.

Brains:

Everyone will agree that being intelligent brings benefits but I would like to say that it can really elevate you give you the wow factor. By this I mean if you are intelligent and careful with your words you will be able create more allure and even more impact with your style as your brain works more efficiently. I would say reading is an excellent tool increasing intelligence because you gain new perspectives and it generally is a great help. If you were to ask me on which genre most beneficial to your life it's kind of obvious but I would say self-help. This also extends to listening in person and to even take a step further and seek out people you believe are wise or their ideas and company will be of a benefit to you in your life. This all contributes to your wisdom and intelligence. Side note- books on fashion, beauty, and surprisingly interior design ( style/colour schemes) are all helpful in your looksmaxxing journey.

Confidence:

This, like all the other points, is key in having the wow factor. This comes from appreciating yourself and beginning to look at yourself in a positive light. Take notice of what you think is beautiful about yourself and say it out loud to yourself whenever you notice it. This helps it become ingrained in your mind. Let me talk about value. You are already valuable as a living breathing person. Being more iconic doesn't increase your value. Celebrities are not more valuable than the average person. Believing this is key in developing yourself, because if you believe that your value only increases as you looksmaxx you will constantly fear how people perceive you and it will reflect in your body language and overall confidence. I think we can all agree that confidence is attractive too. Your confidence grows as you recognize your innate value as a human being.

So why strive to be alluring, eye catching, and memorable? My reasons come from my own philosophy on human nature which is that humans desire certain things in life and that will always be true. Most of us desire being beautiful and eye catching the same way we desire other things in life. I just believe to reap the greatest benefits, things should be done in moderation.

Nonchalance:

The last section is on nonchalance. This by definition means ""feeling or appearing casually calm and relaxed; not displaying anxiety, interest, or enthusiasm,"". If you would like to show nonchalance in your body language you need to really feel that way. I center a lot of my feeling on situations or comments that are meant to offend me on this vibe of nonchalance. By this I mean not caring. Mean girl at school/work looking at you up and down and rolling her eyes? Who cares? She's not important to me. Mean comment online directed towards a group I identify with? I don't need to feel sad, I don't value those people's words and the doesn't need to affect me. Again self talk is very important here, you need to make your voice clear in your head when you say, ""I don't care about that girl's comment, I don't need to feel any type of way,"". Obviously there are times where we will be affected, we are human, but then in that case, a wise person once told me to cry however much you need to, seek support from people close to you and then move on, and try your best to not give it importance in your life.

This also transmits to when your out and about in real life. Have you ever seen someone beautiful, with good style, who walks with their chest up, and doesn't seem too concerned about what people are thinking of them? Their gaze rests moves around the area the are in and they look really attractive and sure of themselves. I think this creates incredible allure and when paired with stunning looks it makes anyone observing make a double take. And when this confident alluring woman speaks she sounds brilliant and charismatic due to her intelligence. I think this what makes up the IT factor but really these are just my musings, so please let me know what you think and if you have anything to add. As a final additional note I would also like to add that physical and mental health is also a priority and it needs to be nurtured primarily for the full package to be complete."	60	5	0.91

I (23M, intelligent, witty, child-free, born Feb 12th 1999) had to take my brother (7M, smelly, stupid, annoying, born Jul 8th 2015) to Pizza Hut yesterday and I slammed him onto the ground. For background my mom asked me the day before and I almost said I wouldn't because it's not my responsibility to care for her semen-demon but she's paying for my uni so I said I would. We undertook the 25 minute journey in my 2008 Chevy Cruze with him sitting in the back left seat browsing Reddit on his iPhone 6s (wow how ironic lol). We got to the establishment and ordered 1 large pepperoni pizza and 2 drinks (Coca-Cola). However the restaurant was busy and 45 minutes later our order still wasn't out. My brother started to get a bit upset and whiny and eventually stood up to go and ask the employee at the front what was taking so long. It was then that my heroic self took the necessary actions to protect the diners of this fine establishment from untold pain and misery by football tackling him onto the ground and dragging him out of the store. However my mom and friends were angry at me and I don't understand why, they said it was ""too harsh"" and ""abusive behavior"" but to me I just took the steps needed to prevent my moms semen demon from ruining everyone's day, AITA?"	112	40	0.95

It's Spooky Season! To celebrate, Missives: Adventures in Letter-Writing will be hosting a letter-writing event this **Friday, October 28th, from 5-6 pm**. It will occur at the **Junior Common Room in Trinity College, at the St. George Campus**. To access it, *take a left from the front entrance, then continue all the way down the hallway and take the stairs on your left, across from Strachan Dining Hall.*

Who are we? We're Missives: Adventures in Letter-Writing, a UTSG-based club that welcomes members from across UofT's three campuses. We hold letter-writing initiatives both locally and globally, and love to share our interest in art, poetry and the beauty of the written word with others. 

We'll be investigating a bone-chilling murder on the Trans-Atlantic Express via our letter-writing skills, so you don't want to miss it! Whether you're already a member of our club or just interested in seeing what kind of things we do, we'd love to have you!

To keep up to date with our club and any changes to our events, you can follow us at [missives\_uoft](https://instagram.com/missives_uoft/) on Instagram, or sign up to be a member of our club and join our e-mailing list, on [our website](https://sites.google.com/view/missivesuoft/home?authuser=0).

So you can hear or watch something and know that information but applying that information into something of value is a different story. The application of that information with consistent accuracy leads to mastery. 

So I think I've graduated kindergarten. The skills I've known about, seen, and watched are now understood in live action. What's really crazy is I thought kindergarten was middle or high school. 

As you're journey within the game gets more mechanical you realize there's a new list of skills you never knew existed or you needed to master. 

Isn't this what makes this the greatest game ever created. In many ways there's no finish line. Notice the title of my post didn't mention college or better yet junior college. 

The evolution of ones game play is a game within a game. A team and individual sport wrapped into one. The list of little tricks and tips is neverending. Like in life experience is crucial to success.

	48、悉数记忆的流沙，那些逝去的年华，洗尽了我的尘沙。  
　　中华大地之上，寺庙可谓多欹！每一处，现今都是名胜，法门寺则可谓名胜中之名胜。  
　　莲青山坐落在枣庄市境内的东郭镇，据记，因春秋战国时期纪王之女在此修炼而得名。  
	15、雨天，微微细雨飘摇，如丝般轻轻款款，倍添愁绪。  
　　没有一个人跟我聊天，而我又不愿无聊，取了名字我挂在那里看着屏幕发呆。天气越来越暖和了，北京的街头已经有光腿穿裙子的姑娘了，露着半截小麦色的皮肤；午后，我会到三楼晒太阳，房东的鸽子就在眼前的地上走来走去。除了上班很少出门。我在想，也许轮回的不是季节，而是我们的情绪。  
　　终身中真实优美的事，今世我不期而遇了你，因你在我的人命里，所以，我的天际是如许青天，秀美多彩，是一起时髦的彩霞，将长久中断在我心中那片青天的乌云里。  
　　你常言道：假如三岁一代沟，你我该是整整隔了一条母亲河的隔绝。何以办法历次都是如许好像？我显而易见，想你确定领会，这不不过血统联系，更是你我忠心相待。你嘟起小嘴怪母亲，把我生的比你美丽，却在局外人眼前夸口，我的姐姐是个美美的文化艺术女青春！眼眸里闪耀的微光，超过我见过爱过的十足优美实物。我与局外人爆发辩论，你把我拉到死后，报告我：“姐，别怕！我来养护你。”我怔住，你回身对那人：“她是我姐，有什么事冲我来。你伤害我不妨，然而伤害她，不不妨！”傻妹妹呵，让我怎样回报你对我的如许情义。你只说：“咱们是姊妹！”  
母亲在麦子成熟的季节总会坐立不安，在麦子开花和叫嚷的日子里，在收割机轰鸣着开过原野和道路的时候，我可以感受得到她的忧郁。  
	49、使我们不快乐的，都是一些芝麻小事，我们可以躲闪一头大象，却躲不开一只苍蝇。  
　　很久很久我都感触没什么，我感触体验的多了，我早仍旧不复诧仙人生的蒙受，本来这然而是一个骄气者的诳语，本质上，我比谁人16岁不妨决然确定摆脱伦敦的徽英差远了。她是暮夏的柳条，我也然而是晚春的薄冰，一碰就碎。"	1	0	1.0

Growing up Black in America, Tineka Smith knew she had to behave in a certain way because of the colour of her skin. She faced restrictions imposed upon her by an unfair system; don't talk back to White people, expect to be stopped by the police and work twice as hard as your White peers.  
Alex Court, a White British man, moved through his life in a very different way. As someone with White and male privilege he saw himself represented in every field of life and so he always had the confidence to excel and push forward.  


When Tineka and Alex first fell in love, they didn't realise how much the colour of their skin might impact on their relationship. But as time went on, and as their lives and cultures became interwoven, they recognised how dramatically different their experiences were.  


In *Mixed Up*, Tineka and Alex open up about their interracial relationship for the first time, and with anecdotes, analysis and raw revelations, the pair attempt to navigate their new and challenging world, confronting race and relationships in the 21st century head on.

I need some help with the math, and I am hoping some people wiser than me can make sense of this.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, our compensation is:

Pay: $49.54/hr  
an additional 6% ($2.97/hr) to health insurance 

an additional 5% ($2.48/hr) to 401k

Total compensation: $54.99/hr

&amp;#x200B;

We have been told that over the next 3 years we can allocate:  
4.75% in year one, 3.75% in year two, and 3.75% in year three.

These percentages can be allocated to any combination of pay, health and 401k. (IE we could add the entire 4.75% to a single spot or split it up amongst pay/health/401k)

&amp;#x200B;

Assuming that our goal is to increase total compensation per hour as much as possible in the long term, and assuming that future contracts will have similar increases, what is the ideal way to structure these percentages? Obviously there are compounding effects at play, and I'm just having a hard time grasping the math to find the correct strategy.  


Will the total compensation diverge over time based on these choices?

Now, Rockstar has since confirmed the issue and has tipped its hat to t0st by way of bug bounty payout. Moreover, an update will be coming in the future that includes the fix, so hopefully, all players can enjoy a snappier experience.

Github tostercx, who goes by t0st on his blog, explained that the bug stemmed from the way the game parsed a 10MB JSON file. In essence, it was being looped over many more times than necessary and subsequently created loading issues. T0st ended up fixing the issue with a workaround posted to his Github, where it gained quite a bit of traction.

t0st's GTA Online Benchmark

Rockstar recently spoke to PCGamer and explained that “After a thorough investigation, we can confirm that player t0st did, in fact, reveal an aspect of the game code related to load times for the PC version of GTA Online that could be improved.” This fixed game code will be implemented in an upcoming update. As a cherry on top, Rockstar has also doled out a whopping $10,000 through its bug bounty program to reward tostercx for his find.

Perhaps with the earnings, tostercx can finally upgrade his PC from an AMD FX-8350 and GeForce GTX 1070 to get involved in more intensive research. With that being said, all players will soon benefit from the change as GTA Online load times improve for PC. We will have to wait and see when the update comes out, so keep an eye on HotHardware for any additional updates."	1	0	1.0

I may have a few stories about this change overall notwithstanding the new cash policy but that’s for later, I’ll give it some more time. We do however take a $150 deposit. It started out at $50 but after a few s*** stained linens and towels they bumped it up … wisely (just don’t take cash period, duh). As I mentioned before they’ve never ran a hotel I guess they decided to buy one after only managing grocery stores in the Deep South. I know they don’t know what they’re doing because our refund policy is “do not give refunds for any reason, refer to management” and this applies to people who DON’T stay in a room and never set foot in said room. In other words, f*** customer service. 

Anyway as I ruminate on my future in this field (well, this hotel specifically) a guy walked in with a central reservation CC on file guaranteed. He said he wanted to pay cash, OK still need the deposit even with a CC on file per grocery policy. As I was explaining that to him he pulled out a wad of 100s and fanned it out several times never averting his gaze from my eyes. I stopped my spiel, looked him square in the eyes and said the usual, cash payments require a $150 deposit which you’ll get back if you don’t s*** on our linens. Well, I didn’t say that exactly but he stilled acted like I insulted 3 generations of his family.

All that cash and a deposit throws you off? lol. I told him his room is guaranteed with a CC I can just run that after he gives me an ID and we won’t need a deposit. Apparently I offended him, I don’t know how, but I told him if he doesn’t cancel through central I will charge him as a no-show. He didn’t cancel so he’s charged, running audit now. Before my old owners sold this property they gave me a raise which carried over to the new owners but that might not be enough for me to stick around here.

For some who don’t know, the Japanese Honorifics are the words they used by calling someone close, for example: Chan, Sama, San, and Kun.

When I got back from re-Watching Sailor Moon Eternal, the characters have been using the phrases a lot in the dub of the film. They really allow it.

Also I remember watching an episode of Fairy Tail, When Erza meet Kagura, Kagura said Konichiwa, which was the Japanese Word for Hello.

Additionally by watching the first episode of My Hero Academia Season 6, Twice said Sensei, where in the English dub the teachers are just referred like how we do in English, Mr or Ms.

So I’m curious, would anyone happen to know anymore anime English dubs that allowed Japanese Speech."	5	43	0.73

Many individuals with autism have difficulties with social interaction and communication, which can make it difficult for them to participate in traditional social activities. This can lead to feelings of isolation and exclusion, which can have a negative impact on their mental health and well-being.

&#x200B;

By providing opportunities for Adult Autism Adventures, individuals with autism can engage in activities that are tailored to their needs and interests. This can help them to develop social skills, build confidence, and make new connections with others who share their interests. It can also help them to explore new hobbies and interests, which can be enriching and fulfilling.

&#x200B;

Moreover, participating in Adult Autism Adventures can provide a sense of community and belonging for individuals with autism. They can connect with others who understand their experiences and challenges, which can be a powerful source of support and comfort. It can also help them to develop a positive sense of identity as an individual with autism, which can be empowering.

&#x200B;

Creating opportunities for Adult Autism Adventures can also benefit the wider community. It can raise awareness and understanding of autism, promote acceptance and inclusion, and foster a more compassionate and supportive society. It can also help to break down stereotypes and stigma surrounding autism, which can create a more welcoming and inclusive environment for individuals with autism.

&#x200B;

In summary, creating opportunities for Adult Autism Adventures is crucial for promoting inclusivity, understanding, and support for individuals with autism. By providing tailored opportunities for engagement and connection, we can help individuals with autism to lead fulfilling and meaningful lives, and contribute to a more compassionate and inclusive society."	1	0	1.0

I called around and it’s “at least” $200 to get it repaired. Repair shops say it is a power supply needing to be replaced. Is it a long shot of trying to get it fixed, or should I get a new one."	2	3	1.0

Don't get me wrong, I still believe that their next release has the potential to be something extraordinary, but it might deviate from the expectations set by ""Rodeo"" and ""Days Before Rodeo."" Instead of a straightforward trap album, it seems like they are gearing towards a more experimental direction.

And that solo of the album is trash 🤢"	1	17	0.17

(I know that for some pegging is more extreme than service for instance, this is just my subjective view, I'm not trying to start a discussion about that)

I'm 5'9 and have a large frame and I'm been told I look intimidating at first, though I have a very sweet voice and gentle manners in general, and I generally love wearing pink and floral dresses. I know this isn't what comes to mind when you imagine a typical domme, but I'd never thought about it before and no one ever commented on it, until last night. I have always thought what I wear wasn't important since I'm not a professional.

I met a submissive guy who served as a lifestyle slave for about two years and very into degradation and heavy impact play. We talked online for a few weeks and met for the first time last night. The idea was to have play session tomorrow. He asked if I sound the same during play or if I change my voice, because I sounded too sweet, and I looked sweet as well. He was definitely weirded out by me. I was confident on trying these new stuff with him (or someone else) until that point but honestly this completely shattered my confidence.  I'm on the spectrum and usually feel self-conscious when I try new things, especially things that I need to perform. This has now peaked. I'm not sure if I want to see him now or try this with other people, even though I really did until last night. It's so stupid but I feel like I don't really deserve someone's submission. Have any of you ever felt like this?

\*\*Edit\*\* 

Guys, thank you so much for your support. I really felt like shit when writing this post (there were literal tears involved) but after reading your comments I feel so much better and my confidence is definitely back. I never for once considered changing myself for someone but I did question if I was fit to dom, I don't feel that way now thanks to your comments."	70	42	0.97

It will just be me and my partner. We'll be arriving mid-October and will leave early-November. I've included specific questions below, but any general advice or thoughts on whether we're trying to do too much would be greatly appreciated. Also looking for suggestions on where to stay our first night when we land in Tokyo since we'll be heading to Osaka first thing the next day. 

&#x200B;

**Day 1: Arrival**

* Arrive at Haneda around 4:00pm
* Pick up welcome suica/passmo, sim card, exchange cash, etc. 
* Train to hotel 
* No other plans, figured we would stop by a conbini and just rest  


**Day 2: Osaka** 

* Train to Osaka
* Check in to hotel - staying near Dotonbori
* Kuromon Market 
* Namba Yasaka Jinja
* Nipponbashi
* Shinsekai
* Harukas 300 for night views
* Back to Dotonbori for dinner 

\>> This is the day that worries me most. I'd be open to skipping Namba Yasaka Jinja or Shinsekai unless anyone things they're a must-see?   


**Day 3: Osaka**

* Cup Noodles Museum
* Minoh Park/Falls
* Umeda Sky Building

\>> Since we don't have that much on this day, I figured we could visit do anything we didn't get to do the day before.   


**Day 4: Osaka**

* Osaka Castle
* Kaiyukan Aquarium
* Tempozan Ferris Wheel - might skip
* Shinsaibashi   


**Day 5: Osaka > Nara > Kyoto**

* Check out of Osaka hotel 
* Train to Nara
* Nara Deer Park 
* Train to Kyoto
* Check in to Kyoto hotel

\>> We had originally planned to visit the Suntory Yamazaki Distillery after Nara, but looks like they won't be re-opening until later during our trip. Any other suggestions for things to do in Nara or Kyoto on this day?   


**Day 6: Kyoto**

* Fushimi Inari
* Kiyomizu-dera
* Gion 
* Nishiki Market 
* Pontocho Alley   


**Day 7: Kyoto**

* Kinkaku-ji
* Arashiyama Monkey Park
* Rilakkuma Tea House
* Miffy Bakery
* Arashiyama Bamboo Forest   


**Day 8: Kyoto**

* Tea ceremony 
* Philosopher's Path
* Kyoto Imperial Palace

\>> Anything else we should do in Kyoto before we leave the next day?  


**Day 9: Kyoto**

* Check out of Kyoto hotel 
* Train to Hakone
* Check into ryokan
* Enjoy the ryokan - rest day   


**Day 10: Hakone**

* Open Air Museum
* Owakudani
* Pirate Ship Cruise? Might skip
* Hakone shrine

\>> This would just basically be the Free Loop one-day itinerary.   


**Day 11: Hakone > Tokyo**

* Check out of ryokan 
* Check in to hotel in Tokyo
* Takeshita St. 
* Shibuya Parco
* Mega Donki
* Shibuya Crossing/Hachiko

\>> It will actually be Halloween on this day, so I planned for us to be in Shinjuku. Anything we should keep in mind for festivities?  


**Day 12: Tokyo**

* Ghibli Museum? If we can get tickets 
* Shiro-hige's Cream Puff Factory
* Tokyo Metropolitan Gov. Building
* Shin-Okubo
* Omoide Yokocho
* Kabukicho/Golden Gai

&#x200B;

**Day 13: Tokyo**

* Tokyo DisneySea  


**Day 14: Tokyo**

* Tsukiji Outer Market
* TeamLab Planets
* Shopping in Ginza  


**Day 15: Tokyo**

* Sensoji
* Nakamise-dori
* Kirby Cafe (if we can get a reservation)
* Akihabara  


**Day 16: Tokyo > Home**

* Check out of hotel 
* Kappabashi Street
* Last minute shopping
* Character Street in Tokyo Station
* Train to Haneda
* 7PM Flight home   


**Additional  Questions:** 

\>> We were planning on packing accordingly to send our luggage straight from Haneda when we arrive to Kyoto. Then from Kyoto, sending it straight to Tokyo. Does this make sense? 

\>> We have not yet booked our stays in Tokyo. Any suggestions on where we should stay for that first night, considering we'll be heading to Osaka first thing the following morning? Torn between Shinjuku and Ginza for the last leg in Tokyo. 

\>> My partner is specifically interested in architecture. Any cool sights we should add?

I used to be a big Ndombele fan due to his ability. However, I note he has been unpopular with fans and managers for a while. 

My question is does anyone have any idea what exactly the issue is? Hes obviously remarkably talented and he doesn't seem to be an unpleasant person or anything. Which is to say, he seems to get along with teammates and doesn't appear to be a party animal etc or have severe disciplinary problems such as Ravel Morrison etc.

Hes on huge money and presumably needs to attend training- cant they just make him do endless sprints if its a fitness issue? Is there any scoop out there about exactly whats gone on ? 

Is there a mental health problem or simply a physical health issue ? I genuinely would love to hear if anyone has any insights because its morbidly fascinating to see a footballer that blessed with ability to be in this position and there surely must be a huge issue if ALL managers just cant abide him at all?

I keep getting dismissed by my current electrophysiologist, so I'm trying to get in with one at the Cleveland clinic. The one I have John Hopkins is a reputed provider, but I have not had good experiences with him in correspondence, and with my one visit with him, what he said to me in person was not what he made note of on his summary in my chart, and it absolutely terrifies me.

I've been having increased incidents of ventricular tachycardia, as well as SVT. I have asked if I am at risk for sudden, cardiac arrest, or sudden, cardiac death, and he just tells me that he's not excited by my episodes. But I'm still having episodes, even though I am medicated for it. Obviously, the medication isn't doing a lot. I had genetic testing done through VA with the arrhythmia panel and the two add-on panels that they have, but I don't know if this is an exhaustive list of jeans that would be tested to look for arrhythmias and channelopathies.

He tells me that I am not going to drop out of a heart attack. But, go figure, he is not addressing, dropping dead of sudden cardiac arrest for V fib or something. 

How do I know if my episodes are benign? How do I know when to trust a doctor? It's maddening and I'm terrified."	1	1	1.0

Yesterday my WiFi seemed to be the problem. Once I reset my WiFi and it’s working on every device, it’s now saying it’s connected to my WiFi on the Fire Stick. The problem is, it’s going in and out of the WiFi and won’t download apps. When I open Peacock for instance, it stays on the peacock screen. I’ve tried restarting it, unplugging it, reconnecting it, everything and I just don’t know what to do. I’m on an internet plan through my apartment complex of 100mbps and I only have mine and my husbands phones on it which aren’t on, and my switch which I’m playing. I don’t understand what the issue is. Please help!	1	0	1.0

Didn't pay attention in school, but I'm happy I'm learning now. With that aside I'm a person that supports Trump, Candace Owens, Vivek Ramaswamy, Ann Coulter (Right wingers, that I definitely dont agree with everything they speak on) but also like certain ideas of Andrew Yang (Left leaning). 
I'm still learning the intricate differences between communism, socialism, and capitalism. Overall though I agree with Communism (which I guess is the extreme form of socialism). I want us all to have equal Income and be classless. I don't agree with capitalism. As I do more research I'm sure my beliefs will be more solidified as being a Communist. 

Again I'm like a 10 year old in what I know in politics. I'm sure this post seems very Superficial, but I just want someone to give me a straight basic answer to help me get some perspective/clarity, in the midst of me trying to make sense of  the basics.


Edit: So all these comments gave me a headache. I feel so dumb, I guess I'll just keep having to read and research until it makes sense. There's so much I dont know. I appreciate all those comments trying to explain, but I still don't get it.

I always liked sports since I was a child and I had contact with the olympic films in this last picture that you guys are seeing when I had 10 years my parents bought for me this 4 disc collection where it goes from 1948 to 2000 but it is only the summer games the winter games are not very popular here I thing you guys know why.
But these versions are really cut into 40 mins at best in each film because there are three movies in each dvd so I think it would not fit all of them in one and if they did in more dvds it would be more expensive as it was already.
But then in preparation for the 2008 olympic games a brazilian sports cable network called sporTV started to broadcast these movies I thought I will watch it again. Until when I started watching there was much more footage they broadcasted the full length of the movies so for the next years I was searching on the jack sparrow part of the internet if I could find it. The official YouTube page of the Olympics posted some movies but there were a lot missing. And then 2017 I already knew the criterion collection and they announced this the 100 years of olympic films. I always thought with myself this year I will buy it and I finally bought. And here it is. Now I'm going to watch everything again because I already saw on the criterion channel."	51	6	0.94

I had a really good relationship with him and would say he was an amazing influence to have in my life, and I miss him quite often. My parents divorced when I was very young so fortunately it was not a double whammy and I did not see my mother in the video. For further context, my dad was in his late 30s and I am aware he was a single, grown-ass man who had the right to do whatever the fuck he wanted with his life. Cue the shitty Minecraft parkour in the background with text-to-speech. 
  So January has already been an awful month for me for a few reasons, firstly I missed the few first days at school after my sports season began. I also have been missing my dad extra lately due to his big support for me in sports and academics, which I'd been doing really great and still am. My phone's screen began to stop working properly and the TV in my room had also gone out randomly. I need to properly emulate how badly I felt during this month, if the month he died was the worst month of my life this month wasn't even in 2nd place, it was 1.5. I'm cooked. 

My phone then fully broke a few days ago while I was making up the last quiz I missed, I decided I'd log into some of my primary social media to keep in touch with people on my dad's phone. I keep a few of his items on my desk for sentimental reasons. My grandfather even suggested I put my phone's SIM card into his old phone before my phone completely killed itself. The following day is a Friday, and me and my friends hit up a wifi overpriced sandwich joint to study and tear up some food. Me and a friend hit up the bathroom to blow it up. At this point, I start looking at his downloaded Facebook memes and send them to my friend in the other stall and start looking through the videos as well. I didn't sit here and watch all of it but I saw enough to know what it was. I couldn't even act normal when we got out of the bathroom, I instantly told them and we were hysterically laughing about it until we got dropped off at home. When I got home I also told my mom and she was mortified as she also lost her dad when she was younger and it's obviously an agonizing thing to find.
  
How do I even get support for this? Am I supposed to just live the rest of my life now? Am I cooked?"	36	12	0.78

I'm pretty bored, lonely and very needy at the moment! It should be criminal to leave a futa this pent up! My girlfriend is out and I've got a whole hell of a lot of nothing to do! Maybe you're in a similar boat! I'd love to have some company to chat and what not. Why don't you stop by and say hi? Maybe tease and tempt a bit, I can be influenced quite a bit! 

While certainly not required I'd love to see a ref of the character you play I think it's fun to comment on stuff about it. So, shoot me a message if you're bored too!

I above all else I love messes, sloppy seconds and the like... Otherwise cumplay, pet play, corruption, bondage, spanking, degrading, risk, impregnation, lactation, beast, cheating, cuckold and all kindsa other stuff! I have no limits aswell

Here's a few refs if you're into that kinda thing: https://ibb.co/album/7NMqhr
