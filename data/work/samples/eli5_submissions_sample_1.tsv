Furthermore, H.W.

This outraged a lot of people and they said it would be the end of multilateral foreign policy and the beginning of more unilateral policy by the United States.

I am genuinely curious about this topic and would like to hear from those that know more than I do about this topic.

My current understanding is that most of the ""native"" peoples of Mexico, Central American countries, and South American countries (e.g. Aztecs, Picunche, Chono), were killed, either by the invading Spanish and Portuguese or by the diseases that they brought (e.g. smallpox).

Does that mean that most current-day residents of Mexico and Central-and-South American countries are of European descent (i.e. from Spain and Portugal and/or other European countries)?

I noticed the correlations below which contributed to this idea:

A large percentage of the residents of Mexico and Central-and-South America countries...

* Have European last names (e.g. Rodriguez (Spain), Alvares (Portugal), Lopez (Spain))

* Speak a European Language (i.e. Spanish or Portuguese)

* Follow a European Religion (i.e. Roman Catholicism ""Catholic"")

However, the way I view them results in incorrect equations describing their series and parallel behavior.  I'm basing this around the ruleset for how an individual resistor acts, then seeing if those rules give rise to the equations.  I'll describe how I'm viewing this, and hopefully someone can point out what I'm misunderstanding.

Ok, first off, I'm going to use the hydraulic analogy to describe things.  Second, all of my resistors will be the same strength.  I'm going to assume the normal pipe is 1 resistance, and my resistors are 2 resistance.  Easy, right?

I'm viewing 2 resistance as cutting the flow in half.  So if we start out with 10 ""current"" in the pipe, it hits one of these resistors and afterward is 5 ""current"".  This is where the problem appears.  If there's another resistor after that (2 in series), it will cut that 5 in half to 2.5.  Another (3 in series) will cut it in half to 1.25.  This means that my ""model"" of resistors is multiplying resistance in series rather than summing (R^N instead of NR).

It is also broken in parallel.  If the current is split in 2 (5 on each branch) going into a resistor on each branch (reduced to 2.5 on each branch), then merged back together (total of 5), then the parallel system has total resistance R rather than R/N.

So something is really wrong here.  How can I describe the individual behavior of a resistor so I get the correct series and parallel behavior?"	1	6

I understand why Type AB is the universal acceptor: since it has both kinds of antigens, it doesn't have antibodies for them.  That means that any blood type can donate to them because the antibodies of type A or type B (in type A or B blood respectively) will not react with the antigens located on the AB blood cells.

This also applies to tornado alley. Domes consistently survive events like this. Underground housing is also an option. It's less affordable apples to apples, but for the same price as your traditional house you can settle for a smaller underground one and not have to buy a replacement every few years. 
  
And in flood prone areas, why not simply buy a houseboat but place it on land? Those who are capable of affording them, obviously. And I don't mean tsunamis, I mean floods like the one that coincided with Katrina. There is of course not much you can do in the event of a tsunami.  
  
Land situated houseboats could be anchored by steel cable to a piling driven deep into the earth with 20-30 feet of slack, coiled up until the flood happens. This would keep them from drifting too far but would be long enough to allow for the deepest conceivable flooding. Building houses 10 feet high on concrete pilings is another option.
  
If it's a small home I'm sure it's simply cheaper to rebuild, but in areas where this happens regularly you think there'd be a demand for novel types of housing that can reliably survive those disasters."	4	8

But if lines are 1000+VAC and they have to be stepped down to 110 or 230VAC anyway, why not transform it to DC at the same time? Seeing as almost every household device runs on DC, I'm surprised this hasn't been done yet. So my question is this: Why have 1000VAC stepped down to 110VAC just to be turned into 5-36VDC rather than have 1000VAC stepped down to 36VDC (or something in that neighborhood) and any device that takes less voltage can have a built in regulator? Aside from eliminating the need for big and expensive power supplies and replacing them with small, cheap voltage regulators, it would make house outlets hella safer.	0	7

Wouldn't molecules be closer together in loose (cold) seran wrap vs seran wrap that has been stretched by heat? With molecules further apart, I picture it being easier for the cold air currents to pass through.

I work for a big corporation, sorry, won't tell you who.  They are a company that sells product to consumers either online or through reatilers.

When I first started there, the person training me had attempted to explain the credit card process to me, and I really want to understand what she had told me better.

Her example, if the credit card number is 0000 0000 0000 0001, when processing the credit card, using the card numbers, will be how they identify where the process/charge is going.  However, the internal system will use a set of ""dummy numbers"" (my words, not hers, because I can't think of a better way to explain this), so while the credit card number above is a bunch of zeroes, the dummy numbers would be something like 1234 5678 9012 3456, that way the company won't and will not be able to store customer's credit card info.

Can anyone explain this better and enlighten me?  I may have been told wrong, or I may have have simply misinformed myself.  I just clearly remember her writing a example CC number on the whiteboard, followed by writing the ""internal processing"" numbers above the original Credit Card number stating that the numbers on top are what is used internally.

Thank you, and apologize for my probably ridiculous way of wording this.  As you can tell, I am very uncertain of what I even mean to say."	0	2

It's one thing when negligence and unsafe conditions lead to the injury, but when it's just a random accident that could have occurred anywhere how do the courts justify fault of the owner? My understanding is that many of these lawsuits are settled out of court to just get it over with and avoid court costs. When actually brought before a judge do the cases often go in favor of the plaintiff or are they thrown out resulting in court costs for everyone?	2	7

She seems to be OK, as she eating/drinking and is [begging me to play with her](http://i.imgur.com/vOT6HSq.jpg). I think her mouth may be slightly burned, but nothing else.

Here's the gist of the post: 

&gt; I was laying in bed on my computer and I saw a big flash of light. My cat ran into the corner and I smelled smoke. I looked over and the power cord to my Macbook was smoking (it was plugged into the computer I was using).

&gt;She started drooling a ton and shaking her head/licking like she had something in her mouth. The drooling stopped pretty fast, but for a good minute it was pouring out of her mouth.

&gt;I checked the inside of her mouth and I see no bleeding or obvious injury.

&gt;Her whiskers are singed and she keeps licking her chops and getting drinks of water. I gave her some treats and she inhaled them.

I keep searching this topic, but I don't understand enough about wires to know what anyone is talking about (even in the ELI5 thread), and people seem to be divided on the issue. Did she get a full 120v shock? What was the flash of light?

You can clearly see, that the background on the left side of the frame is out of focus because the focus is on Robert Redford, but on the right side of the frame the background is also in focus (which is impossible with a normal lens). Later in the movie there are scenes were people in the background walk from the out of focus side to the in focus side, so it can't just be composed out of two separate shots. This kind of technique was often used in the 70's (""Carrie"" by Brian de Palma for example [](http://i.imgur.com/AXsLK18.jpg) ). 

Is it a special kind of lens with a adjustable two-sided focal length? (which would make this scene an in-cam effect)"	5	9

Relates to Apple AirPod Pro’s. ANC means active noise cancelation. 

Not sure if anyone has this specific experience, did some searching but nothing rly on this specifically:

Went from Gen 1 to 2 Pro’s - Yes, the ANC is much more isolating and effective  , however , heavy vibrating / thumping sounds are WAYYY worse on the Gen 2’s somehow !? 

Examples: 

- driving in my little Miata, anytime i go over a bump it sounds like there’s a bass explosion in my ears - much louder than the thump would be on transparency mode , or without them on at all. 
This never happened on Gen 1. 

- medicine ball slams at the gym . Same idea, someone 20 feet away from me doing them while in ANC sounds like they’re smashing me in the head with the ball. ANC off or pods off and it’s nothing. 

Best case scenario the thumping isn’t insane but there is a noticeable increase in boominess compared to the real life less bassy sound. 


Hope this made sense, thank you to all who care to read / respond !



Edit: the Miata has a loud bassy exhaust, which doesn’t do this effect at all in ANC. It’s only loud bassy noises that come along with a strong vibration(hence the road bumps or med ball slams)"	1	0	1.0
