The big thing I don't understand is how they don't at least end up accidentally harmonizing. You would think an average person who doesn't know how to match pitch, would just find a note that sounds good, because they can tell when two notes sound gross, as everyone will have an opinion on two notes being played together, so why do they so often end up singing a parallel part a step or a half-step lower?"	0	7

It bled severely and I got 4 stitches for it. I started to feel a little faint for this injury. But, also, I tore my knee open 6 months ago while hiking and it was much worse of an injury with more blood, a very wide open wound and I was fascinated by it and had no problem cleaning it up as much as it hurt. I've come to wonder why this response happens to my body. I've only ever heard people getting nausea from every scratch, not selective cuts like this. For as long as I can remember this has happened, even when its not my fingers or thumbs being cut. Does it have something to do with the fact fingers can be cut off easier? That's my only guess in this and it was too specific of a question to ask easily on Google. 	0	3

My question is: *Why were planetary gears preferred for automatic instead of ""normal"" gears?*

I know how planetary gears work and I know how normal gears work. I also know how torque converters work and I know that classic automatic transmissions used hydraulics in some way to determine which gear should be engaged. But why use planetary gears? Do they work better with the hydraulic system?

I also know this has been asked here at least once before, about a year ago but I didn't find any satisfying answers there."	3	5

So, say I chuck a marble at the Sun, so that it does a sort of gravity assist around it, and the Sun transfers enough energy such that the marble ends up coming out of it a couple mph faster than it went in.

The Sun would now have slowed down, but by an almost infinitesimally small amount - much less than could be conveyed by even one Plank length (I'm guessing - if not, then just imagine I throw a less massive object at an even larger star than the Sun)...

So... how can this be? Does the universe move the Sun one Plank length every *other* 'frame', or is the Plank length actually not the smallest *""meaningful""* length...? I don't understand."	0	2

Apart from having a great track by Lana del Rey, what struck me was in the video... the amount of greenscreen put in a partiuclar scene is really tiny compared to the size of the actual graphics changes that are occuring.

e.g. in the opening scene there is a whole country estate superimposed over a greenscreen no larger than a big bed sheet!

So what gives?! I thought for green screen you needed to cover the whole area that was being edited out?!

also... during the car /street scenes there are masses of graphic changes, and really small green screens.

Apparently the record for the longest sniper shot has been broken today.

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/canadian-sniper-iraq-world-record-longest-kill-shot-rifle-military-a7802151.html

The bullet traveled 3,450 meters, and, according to various news sources, it did so in slightly under 10 seconds.

I checked the rifle (McMillan Tac-50) the bullet was shot from, and, apparently, its muzzle velocity is 805 m/s. The math just doesn't add up and I feel like I'm missing an important factor here.

Could someone explain to me why it took so long for the bullet to reach its target? Does it have to do with wind, curvature or it simply losing velocity during its travel? (Or maybe with something else completely?)

Please let me know, it drives me nuts. :P"	0	4

I am fully aware of the hospice mentality of ""kill the pain, not the patient,"" as evidenced by 99% of hospice residents being administered a cornucopia of painkillers (commonly morphine). However, I also see many differing views associated with treating those on hospice care. 
Some medical professionals almost wash their hands of the resident after hospice care is elected, while others treat those on hospice care just as aggressively as any other resident in the facility. FYI, I follow that latter.

1.  Do they wait until the snow melts? Does it melt in any short amount of time, or is it there for long periods of time and keeps accumulating?
2.  Are people just supposed to dig themselves out and dig their driveway out? What if they're physically incapable of this?
3.  How do roads get cleared? I can see how a snowplow would work for a foot or two of snow, but not much more than that. 
4.  How is it economical for towns and cities to clear every last road and public right of way?  What if you live in a very rural area and there isn't a city government to clear roads out?  
5.  Are people in these climates expected to just have a supply of food on hand for long periods of time? Do the poor just starve to death?
6.  What if you need emergency services, eg, you have a heart attack at home when you're snowed in and the roads aren't clear? How are you extricated from your home and transported to a hospital?
7.  Is it possible to walk on snow like this or do you just sink in?
8.  How do businesses and stores stay afloat? Do things just shut down for long periods of time or what?

I also get that you can find the area by between two points by plugging in two values into the equation for the anti differential and finding the difference. I just don’t understand  why. What has the anti differential even got to do with anything? Where did it come from and how does it relate to the rectangles? I’ve tried finding other explanations online and on elsewhere on Reddit but it still doesn’t make much sense to me.
