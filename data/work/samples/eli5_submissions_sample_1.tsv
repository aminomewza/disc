But how can this lead to water being a finite resource? Are there other 'destructive' processes involving water that means it will be lost forever?"	0	7	0.29

I have some questions that I would like ""unbiased"" answers to please."	http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2cprzs/eli5i_just_signed_some_paperwork_for_a_company/	"I am now enrolled in a 457(b) plan in the state of Florida. I am also enrolled in something that was explained to me as ""Guided Portfolio Services"". I am really confused on the whole situation, but I realize that I am being advised by a financial planer that will not really benefit unless I benefit somehow. Now weather he will benefit more than me for having me on the plan or not, I do not know. I am an employee of the county that I live in. I signed up for the FRS Investment Plan (Florida Retirement System). I was told that I could terminate the plan at any time and I also chose options that allows me to take my funds out at any time with little penalty if I should choose to. I just don't know if I made the right decisions or not. The rep that worked with me of course said that I am making good decisions, but he has to say that right? Otherwise he doesn't get paid I would assume. I was with a competitor for a little while (ING) but I had very little time or funds invested. I am talking like less than 6 months and less than 400 bucks. So now I am involved with VALIC and so be it. Can anyone please explain to me in a way that a 5 year old would understand, exactly what I just did? I can provide further information if necessary, but I think that I pretty much covered all that I am aware of. I know that I agreed to around 100 bucks being withdrawn from my bi-weekly check.   I also know that it is a ""pretax"" withdrawal. I just am wanting to know what did I do and did I make a good decision. Thank you for anyone who may help shed some light on this for me. I hope you all have a great day!"	0	3

I read both of these and the answers don't address my point: (which I'll explain below)

http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/15skeu/emc2_uhhh_why_i_mean_like_whats_the_speed_of/

http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1q4nrb/eli5_in_eisenstein_famous_emc2_why_is_it_c2/

Yes, I know that because of the equations these are derived from, it has to be c. I know it's necessary for the math to work. I read where someone says it's a coincidence. I think it's not a coincidence. I'm under the impression c is in these equations because the Michaelson &amp; Morley experiment contradicted the leading theory on how light behaves and new theories that tried to explain that of course had to deal with light. Einstein's equivalence principle is directly addressing this issue and from that he developed his ideas about relativity. I know all that. My question is not why Einstein or any other human put c in the equation. My question is not why does the math work that way. My question is, ""Why does the universe work that way?""

What is special about the speed of light? And don't tell me it's special because of its role in the equations. It was special in the real world first, before there were any equations. That's why the equations are written that way. The equations are not the reason why the speed of light is special.

If anybody really understands this, please explain it to me in layman's terms if possible. If nobody really understands, I'm not surprised.

Edit: Someone put something on the top here that implies I forgot to mark it as explained when I got a satisfactory answer. Actually, I have not gotten a satisfactory answer. At this point, I'm not expecting one. I don't think any human being has ever known the answer to this question and that we'll have a different view of physics when and if anyone does finally figure this out.

In other words, starvation seems to be a self-solving (but constantly reoccurring) problem in the animal kingdom: if there's enough rabbits for 10 foxes to eat but there are 15 foxes, then at least 5 foxes will die. You get these drastic changes as predator and prey populations cycle around each other with explosions of prey causing explosions of predators causing deaths of prey causing starvation of predators and so on.

However, human populations don't seem to be cyclical in this sense, and I just can't figure out the economic/biological reasons why. It would seem to make sense that humans grow food for X amount of people, and then when something happens that causes a deficit, we would see a decrease. Farm makes food for 10 people, famine causes 50% harvest, so 5 people would die.

Yet this doesn't seem to mesh with the reality of food shortages and famine in the real world. Human populations either seem to stagnate or even continue growing even if millions of people are starving or malnourished, which is both sad and inexplicable. I've never heard of a situation where a human population snaps back to the level of their food supply because of a failed harvest the way a fox population snaps back if rabbits go away.

What are the factors behind these differences?"	0	10	0.4

So of course it is different wherever one goes, such as kmh, or measure light years, which again breaks down into traveling a certain distance within a time frame.  Is there a measurement of speed that is universal and a true measurement of the velocity itself, not based on one having to know the distance of a mile or kilometer?  Or is it one of those things like there is no such thing as cold, just the absence of heat?  Something that only exists based on something else.	2	16

 - I know all the cold war and stuff, but the Soviet Union collapsed and gone...Is true that that EU are dependent to Russia natural gas...but still, at least in my personal opinion...russia still has a weaken economy and are far away from what they are before and it is just a regional power...

In contrast, China is a rising economy, gaining more geopolitical power every day, besides being all aggresive in the China Sea land dispute...but why don't we see that kind of pression to China...yes we see US doing one thing or another...but nothing compared of what they do towards Russia.

2. Is Russia being the aggressive one?
- I dont know, from my perspective...many Russian' policy are more of a retaliation of NATO closing up....

After the Soviet Union collapse, Russia no longer has the buffer zone from EU to Moscow, leaving it hard to protect from any possible invasion and putting theats to its territorial integrity...leaving Russia with no other option than managing its border countries to assert its geopolitical position....

Yes, Russia has resorted to any means necessary to achieve this goal...but this behavior isnt the reaction of West pressure from beggining?

3. Or maybe...West are simply being dickass to Russia...but i mean...WHY?



- Sorry for my bad english.

PS: I am not Russian, i just can't understand why we treat him so badly..."	1	6

However when I make sure that the font, color, and size are all the same, in replies I see that certain phrases or words are either larger in size or a completely different color that also wasn't used in the mail where I copied it from. Why is that and how can I make sure it gets corrected?	3	11

I have had a helix piercing for a couple of years now and to be honest, it’s been a journey! It took nearly 2 years to fully heal and I found that my ears didn’t take too kindly to certain types of earrings. No matter how much I try, I can’t seem to get on with the types of earrings that are best for cartilage piercings. They have screws on the backs and the design on a long, thin pole that screws in from the front. I keep trying to put them in myself but I find my hands get really sweaty and warm and then I can’t get it to screw in. All of the piercings I’ve seen that are advertised for helixes are these types of piercings - why? Can I buy a standard pair of earrings and use just one of those? Or will that cause issues? How can I find a high quality earring that is fairly easy to insert and screw in and how do I do this?	8	3	0.83

GDP growth rate is effectively the change in GDP in 1 of 4 quarters. Hence, it is measured quarterly, or every 3 months. Based on its name, this should mean that annual GDP growth rate is measured annually, or per year. However, the website instead shows growth rates per quarter, and the growth rates in these quarters are different from the growth rates in the quarters of GDP growth rate. For example, in the case of Australia below:

[https://tradingeconomics.com/australia/gdp-growth](https://tradingeconomics.com/australia/gdp-growth)

The GDP growth rate in the 3rd quarter is a -1.9% contraction. However, in terms annual GDP growth rate:

[https://tradingeconomics.com/australia/gdp-growth-annual](https://tradingeconomics.com/australia/gdp-growth-annual)

The annual GDP growth rate in the 3rd quarter is 3.9% expansion.

I have a baseline understanding of chemistry, and from what I can gather sugar alcohols are basically sugar molecules with an -OH attached somewhere.


This seems like enough to fool the tastebuds into thinking that its regular sugar and send ""this is sweet"" signals to the brain, but I'm curious to how the body actually processes these molecules in the gut.


If the body ends up breaking down the molecules like regular sugar molecules, that doesn't seem very advantageous unless you're a food manufacturer trying to skirt around nutrition labels.


If the body ends up breaking down the sugar alcohol differently than sugar, how does it breakdown, and what are some advantages and disadvantages of sugar alcohol over regular sugar?"	1171	114	0.94

Step #1: Someone who owns 1 share of Apple stock loans it to another person for a week, who wants to short the stock.

Step #2: The person who borrows the stock, immediately sells it, waits a week, buys another share of the stock, and then returns it to the person who loaned it to them.  The person keeps the difference in price.  If the stock price went down (as they thought it would), they make a profit.

Question: why would anyone who owns a stock loan it to someone else, who will sell it thus making all shares of the stock less valuable (supply goes up, price goes down)?  

Even if the person who ""loaned"" the stock is charging a small fee, it still seems like their actions are hurting themselves in the long run.  "	0	3

I understand some of it but, the one thing I don't understand is how does a new peer without any prior connections to the network discover peers?

For example: I've just heard of the SuperGreatP2P program and I go and download it. There are 50,000,000 connected peers to the network. How do I find any of those peers?

Does a P2P network run on top of another network? For example, IRC? That would mean that, if I connected for the first time and had no idea where any peers were, my client would connect to an IRC network, broadcast a message, and get a list of connected peers. This seems doable (in fact, I think Bitcoin does something like this) but a bit centralized and a point of failure.

explainlikeimfive	t3_lsa5za	https://www.reddit.com//r/explainlikeimfive/comments/lsa5za/eli5_why_is_acid_rain_not_on_the_environmental/	2021-02-25 16:15:45	es_mo	Eli5, why is acid rain not on the environmental radar anymore?	https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/lsa5za/eli5_why_is_acid_rain_not_on_the_environmental/	"Firstly, I want to thank this subcommunity - peeking in and just checking the first few awarded posts is great, mostly confirming knowledge I have, and/or offering additional views that weren't well-known to me. Taking the sub title so literally is a rare criticism I have.

So, like the title says, I'm curious why acid rain is not on the radar as far as environmentalism goes. Is the direct threat gone? I'm of an age that the language of the time suggested that this was the number one issue in the world of the day - was this hyperbole? 

The last-best answer that I found here, *removed*, but like with other sources, there is a few points that just never got the treatment I've come to expect. 

One specific point of interest is the steam  output of energy and industry in the first world vs. the 2nd and 3rd worlds. I appreciate any additions to the discussion.

Thanks"	5	5	0.7

We also aren't what anyone would call 'casual' or 'easy'.

This sub's name is idiomatic and that is often confusing to newer visitors.  I'll make a comment below for anyone who wants to talk about rule 4 or just read about it.

For reasons that include a lot of luck, good timing and good fortune this sub is maybe the best known 'questions' sub.  Certainly among newer users of reddit.

The problem becomes that a lot of people just know us as the popular sub for questions and end up stumbling into a whole heap of hoops to jump through to post.

**The TL:DR of this post is that r/nostupidquestions is the sub that many people are looking for when they come here.  It is a place where no earnest question is against the rules (no question is stupid there).  They have a thriving community and reliably produce timely answers.**

We want people to have a good experience and for a lot of people that might mean they want to visit our spiritual sister-sub.  Both are good and we want to help people find the one that fits them best.

This is a fine by the European Union, but Google is located in the USA. How does this work? Is Google subject to European law even when positioned in the USA? Do they have to pay? Will they try to loophole themselves out of this fine somehow? And where does the money go they pay? Is Google subject to the law of every single country? For example, could a single country within the European Union now fine them for the same matter?

This concept came out of a dream I had (so yes it's a little weird). But the more I'm thinking about it, the more it makes sense. 

Would it be feasible - instead of trying to escape earths gravity in one go, dropping a space shuttle from a great height, using momentum from the earths gravity to turn the engines on at the last second and ""slingshot"" into space? Surely the momentum gained would mean you'd only need half the rocket fuel - you could turn the boosters on at the last second to get that final push? 

The last time I did physics was at school, and I'm a bit hazy...hence the subreddit. But even if it wasn't technically feasible, surely it must have at least been considered? I've read enough books to know that escaping earths gravity is 99% of the problem in getting into space. 

Am I talking complete idiocy here or did I just dream up something credible? "	0	18

Anyway, I've just purchased a 2013 Subaru Impreza WRX. From all of the research I've done, most people have said it's an amazing car, both in terms of reliability and performance. It's a bit too early to tell how reliable it will be, but let me tell you- it drives like a dream. My previous car was a 2004 Acura TL, 3.2L v6 with a 6 speed manual transmission. While it was a lot of fun to drive, It had 200k+ miles on it and it was time for an upgrade. The Impreza WRX is a 2.5L flat 4 with a 5 speed manual transmission, and also happens to be turbocharged. Now I've done my research on turbo maintenance/upkeep ect. However, one thing I could not for the life me grasp is how the turbo sizing works. I've never owned a turbocharged car before so it's a bit of a new territory for me. For example, If someone were to ask me ""what kind of engine is in the WRX?"" It would be an easy answer. However, if someone were to ask me ""what size is the turbocharger in your car?"" Id have absolutely no idea how to answer, and would probably just sit there like a dumbass. If anyone can help explain it to me I'd appreciate it. And again, apologies for any errors "	3	3

I've seen so much hate for this woman, and in the middle of it all I read a lone comment explaining that she never really was anti-vaccines. She only encouraged that was take it slow and see what the effects are, first.

I've heard that it's ridiculous that vaccines cause autism, and that anyone who believe that is delusional. Apparently there's no scientific basis for it. 

However, no one's given any facts or any reliable sources. I don't want to take either side just because Reddit said so, but I would like to have more information.

Really, I don't know what to believe. Can anyone supply some facts, and hopefully some links? I'd also like to know what started all these posts -- was there a big recent news story?

My impression is that those are two separate things that tend to be bunched together in the big debate. 

  My understanding is that classifying companies under Title II would declare the internet a public utility and preventing ISP's from signing exclusivity contracts with municipalities and allowing anybody to use utility poles in place, preventing the big guys from stomping out the small startup companies.

  Net neutrality on the other hand, seems like the Government meddling in the affairs of private companies. Most in favor of Neutrality bring up the ""Fast Lane"" proposal. I can instantly see why this is a bad idea, but one would think that creating more competition in the market would allow this problem to be solved without the FCC creating legislation that would give them more control of the web.

  This is what I've gathered from the various articles and threads I've seen floating around. Of course i may have a completely skewed view of how things work (I'm 16 and have no idea how government or corporations work. Thanks, high school!). Please keep answers simple enough for my primitive teenage mind to comprehend and thanks in advance for the answers."	1	1

Let's say I'm from the USA ($). and visiting the EU (€). 

Currently 1.00 Euro = 1.32 USD

From what I understand, because of this exchange rate, it is ""more expensive"" for Americans to travel in Europe, and ""cheaper"" for Europeans to travel in the USA. Aren't the price of goods set independently anyways? Is it the difference in change when prices haven't been adjusted accordingly that's causing things to be more expensive than they used to be? Or does it just have to do with the rates you get at the exchange counter? I don't get it!

Please explain the relationship between exchange rates and relative prices when traveling. Thanks.

Additionally, there's controversy as to whether the lethal injection method currently used is painless and humane (if there is such a thing in the case of a death penalty).

Buffalo got ~7' back in November (December?).  
Instead of worrying about ""Where do we put this snow?"" why not just dump it into the ocean (my case) or Lake Erie (Buffalo)?  
When it melts, it'll run off into those bodies of water anyway and it isn't like Lake Erie is some pristine body of water.

From a business standpoint, it seems like a very inefficient product with a lot of waste as most of the cacao fruit is for the beans. You also have to undergo significant processing before it is even in a largely sellable form (separation, drying, fermentation). Then even more processing for the commercial product.

From a taste stand point, chocolate is naturally bitter. So in order to make a palatable product, you have to add a lot of sugar, to negate the bitter flavor. Wouldn't it make more sense to just start with a naturally sweet product first?

I understand that there are somewhat good health reasons for dark chocolate, but that didn't really drive chocolate to be popular in the first place."	4	4

let me add a little explanation of what I mean because the title probably isn't clear. 

I used to work for an Insurance company specialising in motor fleet, the biggest clients we had would usually be care homes &amp; charitys. I have seen many different charity's have a fleet of cars that consist of something like : 3 Rolls Royce', 2 Lamborghinis, 2 Ferrari's, 5 Jaguars. Etc.

I have also seen salary's of directors/CEO's of Charity organisations. Ranging between 100k - 1M Salary's.

Why is it okay for people to get crazy rich from a Charity ? Isn't this massively frowned upon? Fair enough if you created a charity and you're the sole purpose for raising a ton of money for charity, however shouldn't there be a limit or cap of how much one individual can earn?

I just feel like this defeats the object. "	1	6

So I take a loan from the bank (who reduce their liability by selling mortgage-backed securities, I understand what these are) to buy a house, and I have an adjustable mortgage interest rate, and I have to pay a sum of money back on regular basis, with interest. Fair enough. Now, the bubble bursts, demand for houses plummet and so does the price. The explanations that I've read online just make a sweeping statement and say that this somehow causes investors to sell off their MBSs, mortgage interests rates to increase exponentially, people default, banks lose a ton of money, *Bam* suddenly we're in a recession. 

I'm missing something conceptually here. So I've bought a house, with a loan that I need to pay off incrementally. I in no way intend to do anything with this house while I'm still paying off mortgage. So how does the price of my house falling have anything to do with my mortgage interest rates suddenly skyrocketing? I'm still going to pay off my mortgage on the original sum with interest aren't I? Why would the fall in price of my house lead to my creditors demanding higher interests? If anything, the lost in value of the house is felt by me if I sell off the house after paying off mortgage, at a far lower price? 

Also, the whole bit about how this actually makes us end up in recession. "	5	6

There are online shops and even some kiosks in stores that buy unwanted gift cards. I know they don't give face value, but how does the operator of that service make money on the gift cards because even though they pay less than face value, they own something that has to be used in a particular place. Gift cards have a limitation on where they are negotiable/hold value. Seems illogical to me that the owner of such a service would not be simply trying to convert to cash as fast as possible rather than holding inventory with limited use. And if that is the goal, how do they do it?	2	3
