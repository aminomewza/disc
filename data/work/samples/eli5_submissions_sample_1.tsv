explainlikeimfive	t3_j33o6	https://www.reddit.com//r/explainlikeimfive/comments/j33o6/eli5_can_someone_please_explain_student_loans_to/	2011-07-29 10:25:11	b1rd	ELI5: Can someone please explain student loans to me? (Various questions inside.)	http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/j33o6/eli5_can_someone_please_explain_student_loans_to/	"I know this is a lot of questions, so if you just want to tackle 1 or 2, that is fine with me.

Firstly, the difference between federal and private loans:

* The rate (for private loans) I saw when I Googled was 1.7% while in school, and 3.5% once I leave school. Is this a common number?

* I am looking into getting loans to pay for my housing while I am in school. Someone told me that federal loans can only be used for tuition, whereas the private loans can be used for ""anything you damn-well please. You could buy a car with it, they don't care."" Is this true?

* Can I get both a federal loan and a private loan? Is this a bad idea?

How do the loans work?

* Do I go to a bank to get the private loans, or will the financial aid lady at my school hook me up with it?

* I have no credit. Will I definitely need a cosigner?

* Can I still get my yearly ~$5k Pell Grant if I took out 20k in loans? When I did the FAFSA last year, it deducted the amount I had in my savings account from the amount they gave me. Does that money not count as money I ""have in my bank account"" since it's actually in my school account?

Now, once I have the loans:

* How do I get the money out of my school loan account thingy to pay my rent? Do I need to make a request once a month, or can I get half a year or so at a time?

* Is there a required ratio of money spent on tuition to living expenses? A year of rent will cost me $6900, and a year of tuition at a community college costs about $6000. Is this going to be a problem, me spending more on rent than classes?

Thanks in advance!"	17	3

Please, Reddit...id like to understand a bit more.  I want to vote and vote with knowledge and a base when it comes to the elections this year.  I am in the military and going to war in Afghanistan in February.  So I would like to know a bit more about why the state of chaos....

&gt;Last week, RIAA CEO Cary Sherman confirmed that the country's largest ISPs will voluntarily roll out by July 1 a ""graduated response"" program aimed at discouraging unauthorized downloading. A Memorandum of Understanding published last summer outlines the program, which was developed without user feedback. Under the new system, a rightsholder accusing an ISP subscriber of infringment will trigger a series of ever-increasing consequences. The responses are graduated in the sense that they escalate after each accusation, beginning with steps aimed at educating users about copyright and culminating in the Orwellian-sounding ""mitigation measures"" -- bandwidth throttling or account suspension.

So far my understanding is that investors gain a cut of the companies profits (proportional to the magnitude of their investment in that company) but what exactly do companies gain from selling parts of their business?  
   
  
Is it just for a short term capital gain?   
And if so, why not just borrow from the bank? The latter seems to make more sense because selling stocks essentially means dividing your company, which means dividing your profits and ultimately limiting your companies' growth.   
  
So why would companies do this?

I build [an art robot](http://makelangelo.com) that uses floyd/steinberg dithering to generate single line drawings from photographs.  I find the image quality of F/S is pretty poor compared to [Weighted Voronoi Stippling](http://mrl.nyu.edu/~ajsecord/stipples.html).  I'd really like to build WVS into [the app for my robot](https://github.com/MarginallyClever/Makelangelo) but I can't seem to grok it.  

I found [this great demo of Voronoi stippling](http://philogb.github.com/blog/2010/02/12/voronoi-tessellation/) that I have yet to understand.  I also found [lloyd's algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd%27s_algorithm) which would probably work if I could make each cell contain the same amount of color (points would cluster in darker areas).  Reading a little further I see that lloyd is a precursor to WVS.

So there's three things I don't get:

* initial point distribution
* calculating the voronoi diagram
* adjusting centroids

Please help, I've been stuck on this for 6 months and just left as a ""to do when I'm smarter.""

I recently watched the LEGO Marvel Superheroes computer animated shorts on Netflix and thought they were wildly entertaining.   I've been playing the recent Marvel LEGO game on the Wii U and it's surprisingly awesome.  Probably the best Marvel game I've played since the old arcade days.  I noticed they also have games and movies for Batman, Superman and various DC comic properties. 

As far as I can tell, there has been no crossovers (the upcoming big screen ""The Lego Movie"" seems to have just DC characters), but I still found it odd.  I've heard about all the licensing issues that prevent us from seeing Spider-Man interact with The Avengers on the big screen (Spider-man is owned by Sony) or either of them interacting with X-Men characters (owned by Fox), but the Lego marvel game and animated shorts have all of them interacting with one another.   Don't individual companies own the game, toy, cartoon and movie rights to these characters?... does the fact that they slap the ""Lego"" brand on everything allow them to get away with it?    

**TL;DR:  How is LEGO able to produce toys, games, movies and shows based on DC and Marvel characters when presumably individual companies own ""exclusive"" media rights to some of the characters?**"	3	9

I recently built a PC and now I have a laptop and a desktop. I haven't transferred all my files yet, though, and so sometimes for convenience, I'll transfer only what I need from my laptop to my desktop. 

Recently, however, I noticed the following feature wherein I have the option to [make files available offline.](http://i.imgur.com/vWrtMuq.png). In the screenshot above, I'm considering making some video files available offline. 

How does that work?

According to [this](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows/working-with-network-files-offline#1TC=windows-7), it would appear that my desktop would make a copy of said file on its HDD. 

Does that mean it takes up equal amounts of space as if I were to simply copy and paste the file from my laptop onto my desktop? Or is there some sort of funky compression going on that makes ""available offline"" a smarter and more efficient option.

Cheers!

I'm not asking why does it cost more here than in England - because of government policy DUH! I'm asking the more fundamental question of why it costs so much to begin with. 
My mom teaches a class at Baker College in Michigan. She gets paid $1500 to teach one course for one term. Not $1500/week or month. She gets $1500 total for the entire term to teach that one course. Now if there are 20 students in the course, why in god's name is each of them paying ~$700 ([source](http://www.baker.edu/departments/finaid/tuition-charges-and-fees/)) to be in the course? I mean how many layers and layers of administration do they have there?  The course generated $14000 in revenue and they paid the professor $1500.... I understand the overhead and admin costs, but damn that takes up 85% of the cost of the class?
BTW, Baker is not like DeVry. It is not for profit. It has no shareholders and pays no dividends. 


I took several classes at Western Michigan University online and one of them was this course where seriously there was little to no professor interaction whatsoever. It was a criminal justice course, juvenile delinquency.  You read the book, take the quiz at the end of each chapter, all multiple choice. Then an exam on sections of the book. 100% of my grade was determined by a computer grading the ten online quizzes and two online exams. There was no writing, homework or exam proctors. 

I know only a certain number of kids could be in each course. Why would there be a cap on the number of kids that enroll in that course? Shouldn't that course be offered for free or nearly free? Because really the professor didn't even need to do anything (from my perspective) to administer that course.

You looked at the stock, after careful examination of their balance sheet and other factors, then purchased what you could afford. 

In today's Wall Street, the prevalence of day traders and high frequency trading has completely negated that purpose.

If we were to force stockholders to keep the stock for a year, it seems to me that you would increase the stability of the market and eliminate the need for corporations to show a profit every quarter thereby allowing more investment in capital and R&amp;D.  

However, I'm not an economist, and I'd like other opinions on why this would not work. "	2	6

I thought the latter was for the cutting device and the other for travelling or the network device. The song route 66 is like how i pronounce it for both road and the network device. I wonder why in the us people use the other one since it has nothing to do with traveling and since a router routes traffic that seems the more logical choice? I've also heard people say 'rowter' for traveling but seems really weird to me having songs about it using the other one. The uk seems to have the 'rooster' kind for network and traveling and the 'rowter' kind for the cutting device. I wonder why this is so different.	3	21

Genetics always confuse me a bit. I mean, Punnett squares are pretty straightforward, but eventually I get a bit confused.

So, let's say a guy (XY) has a daughter (XX). Would she have any genes from her paternal grandfather? After all, her father is giving her an X chromosome which he got from his grandmother respectively.

For example, if the guy's grandfather had blue eyes (I know eye colour is more than one gene, but let's say for this argument that it's just one), but the guy's grandmother had brown eyes. Is there any chance at all that the guy's daughter will inherit the blue eye gene from her paternal grandfather?

Since you cant add a subtitle file on the iphon eapp I thought, no problemo, I just add the subtitle to the mkv file itself. In my understanding, mkv was a container format where you have your different audio and video tracks, and, if available, your subtitle tracks of which all can be added or removed like files in a zip container. But apparently you have to *remux* the file, which take quite a while and made me write this paragraph. Can someone explain to me whats going on within an mkv container?	1	3

When a lane is closed for maintenance then a boundary is typically formed from traffic cones. Work tends to be done overnight as the roads are quieter and some of these cones will have a light on top for visibility.  [example from Google image search](http://gb.fotolibra.com/images/previews/600698-traffic-cones-on-a-motorway.jpeg) In the UK these lights are usually orange and is always on when the traffic cones are marking a boundary. However at the start of the road works when the traffic cones are physically crossing a part of the lane which is being closed for works then the lights on top of the cones will flash on and off.  

*To me in a car driving at 70 miles per hour it always looks like the  flashing of the lights is synchronised, almost as if the orange light is travelling along the line of cones away from me as I approach. I seriously doubt that the cones are in any way networked so what am I observing?  Is it some kind of perception thing? Do I just filter out the lights which don't fit the sequence?* 

**TLDR:** Most of my question is providing context.  You can just read the  italicised paragraph if you want. "	5	9

How does it estimate the strength of a position on the board? Does it say ""having control of the center is usually better""? 

Does it look at what pieces a, say, Bishop is attacking and what pieces it would be attacking if what it's attacking moved?

Does it use traditional weighting for pieces? (pawn 1, bishop/knight 3, rook 5, queen 9)

This got me thinking... If you made the room perfectly reflective,  and left the light on forever, would anything happen?  Surely the light is a form of energy,  and you would be adding light energy to the room indefinitely with no way of it escaping. Would the room eventually explode?

I learned about how cold and Flu mutate so that our immune system does not recognize their newer versions. But what I don't understand is, are we constantly passing the infection around year round? There are flu seasons and more people catch cold at cold seasons. Have we just been carrying the viruses around in the off seasons too? We've been able to eliminate many diseases by isolating them.

Password123 has a capital letter and a set of numbers and so does Hgafyvz1086. Why is that more secure? Password123 was just an example and I know that's a common password for some, but just take any word from the English language and add a set of numbers and it's still not perceived as secure compared to a password with random letters and numbers.

Well, today I came across this: https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/5u8l22/us_warns_nato_increase_spending_or_we_might/ , and from what I can gather, the very simplified conclusion people have drawn is that America has been spending lots and lots of money on the defense of other countries who do not spend as much on themselves, and now mostly everybody agrees that other members of NATO should spend more.

Is this an oversimplification though? Is there an opposing viewpoint to that?

And since (correct me if I'm wrong) nerve cells transmit signals through releasing chemicals via their axons that are then picked up by dendrites, it should take at least a little bit of a second to just travel from one cell to another.

I asked this same question to my AP Biology teacher, who explained to me that we simply have very, very long cells that extend from our brain to our appendages to mitigate the above. But isn't the largest cell in the human body the egg, i.e., only 0.1mm?"	5	5

For example, they say values for time is continuous. But wouldn't really specific values (e.g. 0.99999999999 seconds) be considered discrete? Also in physics, how photons are discrete. This makes sense because frequency, although it can have a wide range (like time can), they are still discrete because they can take on really precise values (e.g. 15.99999999 Hz). So, using the same logic, wouldn't time be considered a discrete variable as well?	1	12	1.0

My husband and I are watching a documentary about the James Webb telescope and getting very confused about space and time...

So..if the Big Bang is the point at which the universe began, this is the beginning of time as we comprehend it. So it leads that as we develop more and more sophisticated telescopes, we capture images of further and further back in time, of the early universe. Therefore, our understanding is that we could theoretically capture an image of the beginning of time, or pretty damn near to it. 

However (if we're correct so far) earth was created as a result of the Big Bang and we're in the present, long after the Big Bang took place, and very far away.

So how could we ever actually capture an image of the beginning of the universe, or close to it, via a telescope? How could this be possible as we'd be capturing the image from the present day, viewing it on earth, yet the earth would not yet have been formed in the image taken?

I already have a regular credit card but they said it'd help me bring my CC score up faster from 620 so I agreed (and they gave me a 50$ sign up bonus). I gave them 100$ but my credit limit is only 50$. Why?  
And I've been making small purchases each month and paying it back up to 50$ but no change in my score. Why?  
I already asked the bank to explain but I still don't get it. Can someone please explain how a secured credit card works, the limit thing (give 100$ but only 50$ avail) and how it improves your credit?
