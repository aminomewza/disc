Do you think porn is the seed of our bad habit? I've gone without fapping while still looking at porn related stuff from time to time, but haven't been able to control the fapping for more than a week. I'm thinking that no porn will lessen the strong desire to fap so frequently.

on a side note, I was fapping as frequently as yourself since I was a teenager also, but in recent years have been able to control myself by setting rules such as 1.) not more than once per day 2.) at least one day of no fap in between fap days. If I was able to follow both of those rules, i was doing well. Then I'd try and put some more space in between such as 2-3 days, which works really healthily (is that a word?) for my mind.

I now feel pretty down and messed in the head if I go three or more days in a row, I think it's from looking at so much porn. Kind of like skipping off the bottom. I think I've adapted chemically, able to tolerate the physiological effects of no fapping. Now it's time to go from night to day and give it up completely. Looking forward to meditation to gain control over my mind's desires."	1	0

I think too much porn is part of the problem for me, especially because of how accessible it is with high speed internet.  What I want out of not fapping is to be attracted to women again and be more excited about talking to them; to not fear inevitable rejection so that I can move on to the next girl.

I have never had a girlfriend and I think how much porn I look at is at least partly to blame.  I know that there are no steps that I can follow to make a girlfriend magically appear, but I hope that doing this will help me at least have the right mindset to be more attractive and less depressed."	2	0

For me it was a gradual progression.

The details were hazy but are becoming increasingly clear.  Based on my understanding, Eric stood on a steep hill and in order to reach him, the zombie Louis Fratto began building ramps.  Upon seeing this, Eric called the butterball turkeys, only muttering the words, ""Hey Turkeys, you know what to do.  You know what to do.""  The turkeys came to Eric's aid and the rest is history."	2	0

What are you saying? Is there some sort of conspiracy going on here? I did hear tales of werewolves and snowmobiles. But I was told since Fratto botched the Birthday Party, ETM was out of his mind and directly challenged a werewolf to race snowmobiles. So he could purposely crash and make it look like an accident. This way Kendra could claim his life insurance policy without any questions. But my source could be wrong. As a Texan , the guy I talked to didn't seem to have a real Texas accent. It was as if he was trying to disguise his voice. Strange. I must dig deeper.	1	0

This will probably take a while so I will give the lengthy instructions here anyway.

Edit: Looks like they have given me a bad IP (ending with 0) so they probably change it pretty fast. 

First step is to find out your router IP. Most common options are 192.168.1.1, 192.168.0.1, 192.168.100.1, 10.0.0.1 or 10.0.0.2. Just type these to your browser address bar and hope one of them works.

If above didn't work you have to check it on your own. Enter windows console by pressing ""WinButton + R"", writing cmd and then ok. This opens a black window. Type in ipconfig and press enter. Look for ""default gateway"". IP address right next to it should be your router IP.

With the right IP you will get to your router's login page. Depending on your model, there might be user and password or just password. Either way, try common default variants like root, admin, password and user.

If above didn't work try to figure out your router model and google its default password. If that doesn't work then someone has changed the password and you must ask that person for it.

With the right user/password you will get in router's main page. What you now see entirely depends on your router's model (if you have trouble you can tell me router model so I can look up the manual).

For example I have to click Firewall, then Intrusion Detection and then untick SPI and Anti-DoS firewall protection. If you don't have this option then you should untick them all, see if it works and then tick back as much as possible."	1	0

&gt; First of all, I am running agressive texture management which is why my maps might look odd. I also have only been using this mod for a day, but I think I have it mostly figured out. [This](http://i.imgur.com/s7xvGGA.jpg) is one of my first maps I did, of Ike. Pay particular attention to the hash marks that go across the equator of Ike. Those represent the next 50 points at which your orbit will cross the equator. I did not set up that orbit well. those hash marks are a mess.

&gt; Now compare that to [this](http://i.imgur.com/dY2nKtU.jpg) Image of my sat in orbit of Duna. You see the difference in those hash marks? The difference between my Ike sat and my Duna sat is that my Duna sat is slightly out of resonance with the rotational period of Duna. An example of an orbit in resonance is geostationary sats. Geostationary sats have an orbital period excatly the same as the rotational period of Earth. This is so that they will stay above the same area on the surface of the Earth. Do you think that a geostationary orbit would work well for scanning? Nope, it would barely map anything at all.
&gt; 
&gt; Now when those hashmarks across the equator look more like the second picture than the first pic, it means that the orbit of the sat is slightly out of resonance with the rotation of the planet/moon. I have no idea what resonance that my orbit is slightly out of resonance of, but I do know what the effect is. Instead of being over the same place each orbit, my sats will now be slightly east or west of where they were the pervious day. This essentially makes the sats scan slices at a time, allowing for a perfect scan without any gaps.
&gt; 
&gt; Ug... That was hard to explain, I hope you get the idea, I'm sure I didn't explain it too well. I just figured all this out myself less that 24 hours ago.
&gt; 
&gt; Edit: Notice if you look closely, how that Ike screen shot has a bunch of random missing spots, while the Duna screenshot has a couple slices missing. Every time Duna rotates, my sats shave a little bit off the sides of those slices. If I were patient enough to let it finish, I would have had perfect coverage of the entire planet. Also note that the purpose of these sats was actually to scan for Kethane, but I just installed scansat, so i figured I would do both at the same time. I found the big map INCREDIBLY useful for optimizing my Kethane scanners for perfect coverage.
&gt; 
&gt; Edit2: To the people complaining about the size of the map, those two lines in the bottom right corner that look like this: // . Click and drag that to adjust the size of the map"	2	0

Sorry about this!  This subreddit was kind of 'leaked', and we didn't expect people to find it as early as they did.  That's why content is so bare from us here.  We'll be doing a summary with nice screenshots and juicy details when we start pushing this sub.  Sorry for the graveyard for now!

&gt;What platforms are you supporting?

PC.  Meaning Windows, Mac, and Linux!

&gt;What characters have been confirmed?

[Dustman](http://www.thevideogamegallery.com/data/thumbs/790px/0013/tVGG_13158.jpg).  And only Dustman for now.  We won't be reaching out to other devs for their IP until Dustman is nearly finished.

&gt;Is it open-source?

Yes.  Yes!  Very much.  We're on a premade engine no one has really played around with extensively called [Godot](http://www.godotengine.org/wp/) and is coded in Python.  We hope to have steam workshop integration so that people can put in whatever custom skins they like.  Ideally, it'd be a mix between Brawl Vault and Team Fortress 2 workshop.

&gt;How close are you to an (alpha, beta, or final) release?

The game is playable, but not fully functional or fun yet.  Every core mechanic has not yet been implemented, such as attacks.  We're working on getting the foundation built as I type this.

&gt;Any available demos or early builds?

Hopefully soon!  We're working on it as much as we have time for.

If you have any more questions, feel free to ask here or just submit a new post to the subreddit.  I apologize for the lack of content on this sub again; once we have stuff to show, it will all be here!"	3	0

I imagine the reason why most people haven't even tried doing a fighting game with so many indie game characters would be because doing so would be a licensing nightmare. That's not just from other developers, either. If a certain character is fully voiced, getting their voice actor to do audio for the game would be significantly expensive, depending on the person.

Also, would this game be something we have to purchase? If so, what kind of purchase? Would this be a fixed-price game like Skullgirls or (presumably) the in-development Rivals of Aether? Or will this be more of a free-to-play title like Killer Instinct or the in-development Brawlhalla?"	2	0

Written, explicit, consensual, clear, legal permission from devs.  We're not touching anything at all unless we have all of those.

In our wildest dreams, down the line it could be a TF2 Dota 2 inspired Free to Play with an ingame store for fan-made cosmetics and skins, blending Brawl Vault and Steam Workshop.

But until our budget quadruples and we convince Valve to work for us, it'll be a one-time purchase like Skullgirls.  And like Skullgirls, I could see us patching content in and even kickstarting major content updates."	1	0

The equation we're solving is a second order differential equation; here's it's basic form:

    m * (d^2 *x/dt^2) + c * (dx/dt) + kx = L* (d^2 *i/dt^2) + R * (di/dt) + (1/C)i

i is current and x is displacement. There's a relation between the two, but we haven't defined that yet because we don't know how we're generating power yet. To put it simply we could say something like: for piezoelectric: 1*x = 2 * i, and then you'd solve for either x or i depending on whether you were an EE or an ME (or both if you're a sadistic math student). But lets leave all the math behind for a more practical solution. 

***

The human input you're describing (in energy terms) is an impulse, or a very quick, short lasting, high magnitude (""height"" in an x-y plot) force spike. This is great for doing things like breaking stones, or hammering nails. If we convert this directly to electricity we'll see something similar to what happens when lightning hits (insert anything).

The output you're looking for is going to *require* a long (relative to the mechanical impulse) period (time that it occurs). It will also most likely *require* a much smaller magnitude (thinking 5V LEDs). 

To convert one to the other, you need a type or storage. Think about a pond connected to a river with a small outlet tube; the river can have no flow (typical case), or there can be a giant storm surge, but the flow from the outlet pipe remains the same (unless the river fills the pond too much...).

The cheap way to do this is probably with electrical capacitors, because impulse energy storage in the mechanical world almost always requires fluid flow, which usually ends up being more expensive than it's worth.

That's my two cents, for what it's worth. If you're interested in going the mechanically dampened to electrical route, let me know and we can figure something out."	2	0

The goal with this design is to not change the experience of the person swinging the hammer while still accomplishing some power generation.  I know I get pretty particular about my own work out equipment, and changing the surface that I'm hitting would bother me, say replacing the tire with a steel lever that's driving a machine."	2	0

It'll certainly pack way more power than any cheap HDMI receiver and the benefit of lossless surround audio vs. 640 Kbps AC3 isn't really that substantial. You can definitely build a solid system with this. 

This is kind of neat since it's from the one generation of AV equipment to use DVI. Plus, if you upgraded and then wanted to build out a basic  multizone audio system, you could link this up to a RaspberryPi with the RS232 port, build a web page to control it, and have a smartphone controlled audio distribution system.

I think he's also the guy who put together a nice little web server I used too. (His site is blocked by my work firewall so I can't check.)

The Marantz also has IR repeater input so you could do that too, but RS232 should offer two way communication so you can actually know about the status from the Pi. The IR setups are kind of dumb/disconnected from the receiver so the Pi can't really know the status. (IE: if it's on or not, what the volume is set to, what input it's set to already, etc.)"	1	0

Christmas songs by groups is really cool because it's cool to see how they sing a familiar song their own way - where they harmonize, when to sing solo, when to sing as a group, the instrumentation they use.  I just heard one (forgot which one) by Little Big Town and I just realized how much more variety groups have on a song.

I do a shit ton of after effects alongside my editing because I was interested in doing it and got better at it over the years on a variety of projects. Now it comes pretty second nature to me and I was able to get a lot of extra work as a freelancer. Now I am pretty stable so I don't use it as much, but it's still there in my brain and I kick over to AE once and while for something more complicated. So no, it isn't necessary, but if you have an interest in any other aspect, feel free to follow it and see where it takes you. 	4	0

In smaller markets, it may be beneficial to at least learn some 2d motion graphics.

As an editor, I've never been asked directly to do any 3d visuals or deep effects if we had the option/money to give it to a specialist or studio. I think the most I've done is one 3d motion graphic logo and some camera tracking to pass to our vfx artist.

I think, in the long run, it's always better to learn as much as you can about the VFX process if only to be able to foresee any workflow issues or to communicate effectively to vfx people.

tl;dr: Do you have to learn it? No. Should you? Probably."	3	0

Lots of green screen composites, and little clean ups/painting out things. I have seen editors spend weeks doing crazy after effects work, but usually narrative tv seems to have the attitude that we have VFX people to do the work, and as long as the temp effect isn't too distracting, it can wait. 

I'm a big fan of doing all my temp vfx only in avid (not using other programs) simply so if something needs a tweak I don't need to fire up another program to fix it (for instance if you notice a mistake right before a screening)

Windmills cost 250 production and provide 2 + 10% to buildings. Well, just the +2 would require 125 turns to pay for itself.

On the plains they usually spawn on that's a tile with 2 Food, 1 Hammer and 1 Gold. The hammer can arguably substitue a hill, the food means you can keep growing and the gold's nice. Now if you improve that, you get 1 more food and 1 more production. On a simple yieldless desert tile that's TWO food, a hammer and one gold just from salt. Given it usually spawns on plains, that would be 3 Food, the yield of an unimproved food tile on jungle or grassland, 2 production, which is usually yielded by unimproved hills and a gold, which is nice.	3	0

Cities settled mid-game and for whom multiple buildings were bought once settled benefit more from flat and a windmill purchased.

Any city (except the first few) with limited production but good food benefits from the specialists of a windmill (primarily if you can afford to purchase it).  A city with a windmill will give 7 +10% to buildings more production in the mid and late game.  A hill however gives +1 production and defense, both of which matter far more in the early game.

On harder difficulties, the most difficult invasions to repel tend to be the early ones.  Hill v. flat can be extremely important when Assyria invades you on turn 70 with 3x your troops and that +1 production could be between 25%-100% greater production towards that wall.

Being on a river, coast, or next to a mountain/desert (only sometimes on the desert) to me is more important then being on a hill."	2	0

The value is not just in the total net production, but when you receive it. Windmills allow you occasionally shave turns off of important buildings like public schools, factories, or research labs.

For instance, let's say that your third best city could build a factory in 10 turns. With a windmill, that would go down to 9 turns, which means that building one earlier would get you an ideology and the associated bonuses one turn sooner.

So I always keep that in mind.

In addition the Windmill gives an Engineering Specialist slot, which I always like to max out for the +2 production, +2 science, and more Great Engineers to rush Wonders. So if settling on a hill leaves you less mines, I might sometimes settle beside it instead.

EDIT: In total, you could be giving up +7 base hammers (3+2+2, which will get multiplied), +10% production towards buildings, +2 Science, and +3 Great Engineer points per turn."	0	0

If you have lots of production available, but little to no additional resources with +2 +3 +4 yields, settling the hill for a quicker start might be the way to go.

First of all, don't use a hamburger menu. It's not functional, nor is it necessary. It's cool from a developer standpoint because you get to save a lot of space, but 1) you don't have any space you need to save, and 2) it's making it more difficult for users to find stuff.

Secondly, I don't see the need for a steam authentication. Use something else like google or facebook (either in addition to or as a replacement), if anything. I don't like the idea that I have to sign in with my steam account just to rent a server.

From a businessmodel perspective you're competing with $15-$50 a month for a true dedicated csgo server from a host.

But most people don't have a need for a 24/7 csgo server. So if you could integrate some kind of easy to use micro payment (1$ for a 2h server) you might have something viable.

The only thing you would have to solve is creating a scalable distributed hosting solution. Did anybody already try to use amazon for hosting csgo servers? "	6	0

I would suggest you continue to use DigitalOcean for this site due to one reason: Pricing. DigitalOcean has the best prices out there, and if you expect to keep this service free, DigitalOcean, at the moment at least, is the way to go imo :)"	1	0

There is a possibility, there is a chance, etc.

When you provision a VM from them, it is done on what ever hypervisor can support it. So if you are destroying and rebuilding constantly you will also increase you chances of landing on a host where you get bottle necked.

Just because you have a good experience doesn't mean /u/Mrpig is wrong. He is actually right. You just got lucky, I bet if the other VMs start doing folding, debugging, compressing or just become very active you will have a noticeable impact.

This is why a VPS is cheap. You are not paying for any dedicated anything. Think of the bank system, If every customer of the bank were to walk into that bank, ask for all their money in coins/notes the bank would run into issues fast. First they will run out of money to actually give to people (running out of resources). Then you will have people fighting and arguing over who gets what (resource ballooning) and eventually the bank will say fuck it, close its doors and you dont have anything to show (crashing).

When you purchase a dedicated server you are pretty much buying your own building (still talking about banks here) to do what ever it is you want. You are also guaranteed 4 walls, a roof and floor, power, water and access. If you choose to make your own bank (esx for example) you can feed off the uneducated. Or you can use those resources and run a couple dedicated servers that have zero reason to fuck up.

Also, you get what you pay for. 5 bucks a month to me sounds like a joke for a CS server (because it is). Reliability &gt; Affordability when it comes to servers.

EDIT: I will say this in case this gets out of hand. I am in no way bashing the services Digital Ocean provides. In fact, for what they advertise they are more than enough. If you have a logical requirement for a VPS they are hands down the best imo. Customer support is on point, massive tutorial base and KB, tons of locations and services. They are just not a game server provider and If you ask, they will say its possible but probably not recommended. "	4	0

Certain commands on online servers that aren't hosted by yourself can only be changed from the server operator (who owns the server).

If you set a rcon password and ingame put `rcon_password &lt;password&gt;` into the console you can change commands that you normally couldn't by putting `rcon` infront of the game.

You bring up good points there, and of course it might be a problem, and I agree fully. However, my point is that DigitalOcean is not too bad, and you get a lot of performance for your money. If this site is to be a premium paid site, you would expect some stability of the CS:GO servers, but if it is to remain free, buying a dedicated server is not economically viable. "	1	0

I don't think protocols in the transport layer define the route a packet takes. They do have different error handling though, UDP having none.

So drawback for UDP ping would mean potentially having to do multiple ping tries if it fails because you won't know if the server is down or if the packet was just lost.

And drawback for TCP would be potentially slightly inaccurate readings since it's error correction and detection mechanisms might make it be a tad bit slower.

Either way I think both can be used since the drawbacks for each aren't super huge."	1	0

You are just going to add overhead to the server that is actually not really needed. You are adding an additional layer for no reason or no actual benefits. In my eyes docker, vagrant etc are used to isolate application for specific functions. Example: I want to test my code on Version X of this web server and compare it to Version Y and see how they work.

The fact that you just change port numbers and you have a totally different server utilizing one directory with the server files also reduces the need to constantly have multiple ""installs"" running on multiple other OS installs. There are tons of reasons you could have to use these tools but they just dont' provide anything proper security/organization/resource management can't already do. 

Like my previous comment, I am not bashing these tools (in fact I use vagrant) but for this purpose there is no logical benefits that would come of using container based software. Now if he wanted to rent out ""servers"" and access to them while maintaining proper security and ""isolation"" using a single dedicated server this solution could work.

Just start up a server and go down the port range. "	1	0

Maybe the dreams will die off eventually, no pun intended. 
Maybe if you try some sort of meditation and or prayer before you go to sleep, it will keep the nightmares away. Stop drinking so much if you do. Our subconscious minds are a playground especially when their altered with drugs or alcohol. 
I definitely wouldn't go back to that house. 
What if you found a legitimate psychic that could help you cleanse your home and yourself and maybe show you how to keep her away-for good. Have you done any research at all besides with us on Nosleep on the Internet to find out what could be causing this and how to get rid of it? I like my psychic idea best, though. They know how to banish ghost, spirits demons etc.  Try that and keep us posted. I'll be praying for you, your safety and to get rid of the spirit that's ruining your once happy and carefree life. 
Afterthought, maybe since you referred to the House as fake, is it possible that when you went there you were disrespectful there and that's why this could be happening? Like I said, it's possible if you did things to protect yourself and your home, the kind of things you constantly hear about cleansing, blessing and prayer sure wouldn't hurt.

Domestication can only be completed with herd or pack aninals. Domestication involves taking animals that are tame and breeding them. Then you select the offspring that DO NOT show aggression towards humans for further breeding (In Russia they have been trying to domesticate foxes for the past 50 years). Domestication is a long process. I suspect tigers aren't domesticated because of the cost of keeping them and the difficulty in controlling them if they had a psychotic break. 	1	0

Instead of going Iomedae Templar you could just play a paladin and be pretty much flat out better.

Also, the Divine Pool looks very small. I seriously doubt that you can afford more than 14 cha, 16 at most with this type of build, so your pool is probably going to be 3 at level 2, 8 at level 10 (with +2 cha headband). The problem is that you can do SIX different things with it and with the pool being so small, you are going to pick 2 powers, use them all the time and ignore the rest. At level 10 you can also cast the 5th level domain spell, for almost all of your Divine Pool, yet it is probably still the best use of your pool since the other abilities are somewhat lacking, with one notable exception:

Divine Shield looks completely broken and has a cap that is never going to be relevant. At level 5, you absorb up to 50 damage already, so you only hit the cap if you take 100 raw damage. First of all, that kind of damage would kill anyone else outright and second, even after the 50 % reduce you still take 50 damage and that will probably still kill you.

The idea isn't to be *better* than a paladin, but still a valid option. In my opinion, the paladin is restrictive and has very few options and I feel all paladins are more or less the same minus some minor roleplaying mechanics.

&gt; Also, the Divine Pool looks very small.

I can see that. What do you think would be better? Increasing the size or making the SLAs just a flat 1/day with no other cost?

For the Divine Shield you could make the cap around 5 / 2 levels ? Or make it work only against a single hit, after the attack roll but before damage is rolled. That way you can't just use it every turn and half the damage of everything."	1	0

Imagine having a 6+ game road trip where you have to pack an extra set of jerseys, socks, helmets, gloves, breezers, and maybe even goalie pads. These would have to be packed at the rink, brought to the airport, unloaded, brought to the rink, unpacked, sorted, washed, repacked, and sent back to the airport, etc. It's way more work for them than it's worth.

Occasionally they will have teams wear the opposite colors for one game but that's only when the visiting team is on a 1 game road trip. "	6	0

Every year, late in October, the Hawks have a circus trip where they spend about 6-7 straight road games in the West Coast. (It's because the circus takes over UC for 2 weeks). It's unfeasible to bring their red jerseys for such a long trip since they usually play Calgary and    Arizona that time.	1	0

In more detail, most libertarians believe the state does not prevent monopolies, but rather creates and buttresses them.  Hence these are coercive monopolies.  Absent the state, the only way a monopoly could arise is if it offers a better price, a better product, or does some other thing that customers prefer.

If there's a profit to be had, the industry will attract investors and capital regardless of startup costs.  In fact, because of advances (in technology, labor methods, experience, etc.) the later entrants will generally have lower startup costs than the trailblazers.

Excuse my presumption, but if you're referring specifically to ""natural monopoly"" theory, one look at the graph here should set your fears to rest:
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_monopoly

The total cost of a single firm TC(Q) only works if they keep their price below their competitor's TC(q).....the second they raise the price above the green, they are inviting competitors to come in to offer a lower price and profit by doing so!  It's not naïve, its just economics."	1	0

What if a company providing say...power to a small town raises it's rates, harming other business and people, then when a competitor spends some money to build another plant near by to compete the first company then lowers its rate (using the capital they secured during the time rates were high) to a point where the competitor can't compete and wait for them to fail then raise rates again?

How could anyone compete with that? It would simply make the town unfeasible for living/business and people leave, which would mean the original company would lose it's income source, sure, but by that point they've probably made enough to simply move and do so again.

Some people are always going to go for the cheaper price.  Others might still be patrons of the second company (or third, fourth, fifth, etc) despite the now higher price.  There's an example where Rockefeller would do exactly this and one of his competitors made his profit each time by essentially building factories Rockefeller would buy once the factory lost to him (note: might not be Rockefeller). The second company might have a more profitable business elsewhere and be willing to take the loss for a while, potentially to the detriment of the first company. A particular bright inventor/entrepreneur might find a way to sell a more efficient energy producing product that can be installed in their customer's homes for a one time price and a contract to remove waste material for free because the sell off the waste material is where they make their money.

 I find the handwriting too inconsistent. If you look at some of the letters, like the printed M, it looks like it was written by someone who can barely hold a pencil, or make the lines meet in a point. I mean, that's how a 5 or 6 year old would write an M. Their fine motor coordination isn't developed and/or they have to stop to remember how the letter looks.

BUT, if you look at other letters, like the K, there is a clear flourish there, which would have been written by someone with good fine-motor control and enough writing experience to have a kind of a style. Someone with a good four or five years more writing experience than the person who wrote the M.

The ""aluminum"" word is also too advanced in comparison with the printed ""M's"" You can see its very small, which is in itself a sign of maturity in handwriting. The spelling is off but the spacing and letter formation aren't that far off from the handwriting we see in normal, literate adults.

I'm not a handwriting analyst, but I do have a lot of experience teaching handwriting in Special Ed. If I were to bet money on it, I would say a 95% chance its written by someone who is deliberately screwing it up."	7	0

Here's his analysis (this is not a joke, he really posted this to his Facebook page):

&gt;NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART: For those wondering what the signature on the Anonymous note in the Avery case meant. It's really sick and it was Ed and the Occult. SIKIKEY has 7 characters as does the name ""EDWARDS."" The ""S"" at the beggining had a lot of people wondering if it was a ""5."" It was. The 5th letter of the alphabet is ""E,"" the authors name starts with ""E"" and ends wih""S"". (edwards) The letters ""I"" and ""K"" are repeated and represent the numbers 9 and 11 in the alphabet. You end up with ""E 9 11 9 11. The next letter is ""E."" You end up with E 9 11 9 11 E. The authors first and last name begins with ""E"" and ends in ""S"". The ""Y"" at the end in occult terms stands for ""YAJNA"" which equals ""SACRIFICE."" TERESA HALBACH WAS SACRAFICED by Edwards. Edwards tied many of his letters after the twin towers were struck to 9-11. He anthraxed the USA after 9-11 and sent letters dated 9-11-2001 to congress and the media. In the Scott Peterson case, just after Steven Avery was released on 9-11- 2003, Edwards detailed the significance of 9-11 in a letter sent to the Modesto Bee. He tied the kiling of Laci Peterson and her unborn child to the OCCULT, which is actually ""HIM."" The OCCULT had setup Scott Peterson just like Steve AVERY. This is deep shit and disturbing, but Edwards tied many of his set-ups to 9-11-2001. The refrences to 9-11 are throughout his letters he sent from 2001 until his capture in 2009."	21	0

In fact, it was how I felt. But these two theories (yours and OPs) could technically converge. You'd say some of the print looks deliberately poor with some points of skill. When I'm taking notes from some one on the phone, my handwriting takes a similar change.

My first and only assumption is that someones saying sickie is key 

(ST took the 31st off)

From there the body was burnt in an alluminom smelter (hmm I thought ST works at one of those)

3am bit (if this note isn't a thrill seeker on a downer) I can't realistically fit to ST without bein deliberately biased.

i really find 100% of the thoughts on this to be vague and a bit obscure .... sikikey is only phonically spelt to sickie key ...... I know the psychic theory is popular but I'm stumped and even my theory of what it means doesn't explain anything it just assumes someone knows who did it and they daren't take it further"	2	0

A sillcock key is a square ended maintenance tool used to turn on water valves on the outside of buildings. I think the purpose is so that not anyone can turn on the valve; most buildings, probably including the aluminum smelter would use a valve that requires one. Although available for purchase at some hardware stores or on line, they aren't exactly common. It's also not an everyday word, and Sikik could be pronounced quite close to silcock; and since its such an uncommon word, one might think it is one word, like silcockey; so that if you've only heard the word and never seen it spelled out, sikikey becomes a reasonable phonetic spelling of sillcock key, especially among factory workers in Manitowoc, WI.

If this was correct, could it mean somebody stole a sillcock key from maintenance at the aluminum smelter, or bought one and used it to access an outside water faucet to wash away evidence? Or used one at the time and their fingerprints would be on it?

The owner of a sillcock key could be a person of interest? Somebody call James Lenk, we need him to plant one.....

""Sikikey"" sounds like how a toddler might try to say Stackowski. Maybe one of the kids called her that and the adults thought it was cute and became a nickname for Jodi?

To me it has to be a name based on where it appears and it's too badly misspelled for it to be any of the ""something key"" options or ""psychic"". Why would the author not write ""I know this sikikey"", everything else is fully written out. 

Maybe Jodi wrote it as a misguided attempt to point them away from Stephen and used the nickname to partially obscure her identity? Or maybe Jodi told the person who wrote the note and they used the nickname so it was decipherable but not obvious?

What the heck is that? No sense. Or at least as much sense as Suzuki or a Suzuki sidekick. At least a Suzuki is connected to the scene. And the one person who brought that up is also the person who tracked the crazy path of BZ so that is at least some credibility in my opinion. Ok I was a teacher so I get spelling problems. But someone who misspells Friday is not going to sign off with the word psychic. Edit: or at least has as much probability as the idea of Suzuki. Personally now that I always see Suzuki shot down really quickly then perhaps there is more of a probability than before.	1	0

&gt;On Thursday, 11/10/2005, at 1826 hours, I (DEDERING) did speak with Officer FRED LAITINEN of the GREEN BAY POLICE DEPARTMENT. He advised me the GREEN BAY POST OFFICE pulled a piece of mail off their conveyor and reported it to Green Bay authorities.  He indicated the piece of mail consisted of a letter without an envelope, which was folded in thirds. He stated there was no stamp attached. He advised me the note was addressed to
MANITOWOC SHERIFF and had AVERY written on it. He indicated to me the note, upon inspection, revealed that the writer indicated a body was burned up in the aluminum smelter at 3:00 a.m. on Friday morning. He indicated the note was signed SIKIKEY. He stated the note was written in blue ink and had both printing and cursive writing in the body of the note. He indicated the mail that was being sorted in Green Bay comes from Manitowoc, Two Rivers,
Green Bay and De Pere. LAITINEN advised me gloves were used to handle the processed piece of mail and the note would be held at the GREEN BAY POLICE DEPARTMENT subject to our contacting them.


By way of comparison, the bone fragments were found in the burn pit on November 8, and the [death certificate](http://www.stevenaverycase.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Trial-Exhibit-16-Halbach-Death-Certificate.pdf) lists November 10 as the date she was pronounced dead."	2	0

They can't send out the original letter, of which there is only one, because that's a piece of physical evidence.  The only way to release it is to make copies (electronic and/or hard-copies) and the only way to do that is to photocopy or scan it - hence the lines showing where it was folded.  The same would be true for all of the hand-written records.

Is there a single Turkish person or someone of Turkish heritage that we've seen in this entire case anywhere?)  makes more sense than someone in an a rural community who lacks the ability to understand or properly spell certain words (let's not forget this is the same area and type of people that, like Brendan Dassey, probably struggle with the meaning of words like *inconsistent* and other phrases during his testimony at trial that he didn't understand and had to be rephrased) and takes the word psychic and spells it sikik. I've even seen kids spell the word psychic just like that. So I think saying that switching the note up to suddenly be in Turkish based on some capitalized letters is really stretching to get to the idea of ""makes more sense"", really relative to almost any other explanation out there. It's simply not plausible. Out of the thousands of languages on the planet, you could write almost any word phonetically and then find *some* language in which those letters spell out some cryptic phrase that seems tangentially related to the case.

I guess I don't see it as a ""*document*"". I see it as a potential piece of evidence (or clue) , and a photograph of the original should be released (like a photograph of the bones as they sat in SA's pit, or the burn site at the Quarry, or the .... actually, I think I just inadvertently supported my own argument further ... Lol). 


It's just my opinion, but there seems to be something ""missing"" on the back where it says ""Manitowoc Sheriff"" ""Avery"". It doesn't really specify ""anything"" ... and there's a big space before ""Avery"". 


Wouldn't it make more sense if the words ""*is framing*"" were in front of ""Avery"" (?).  


""Manitowoc Sheriff""

""Is framing Avery""

Spacing makes more sense, and it actually ""says"" something.

It's hard to test, though, because you'd have to look at a memory value or eyeball it off of the percent of the bar, maybe analyze it by pixels or whatever, which is work.

However, weapons use the same stamina at all reinforcement levels, so once you're at your 120 level, you can backup a save and respec and test out what one has the right stamina values for you without a lot of work, and if you run out of respecs just reload, or if you dislike the build, reload and try a different weapon."	1	0

Maybe you've already done something like this? But we sent out an email to our extended family with pretty clear instructions about how we will be communicating with them when Lucy gets here. We'll send a text when we are checked into the hospital, then another when the baby is born with a picture and an update on how everyone is doing. We also specified when we'd be okay with visitors (day 2, during visiting hours, with the caveat that if we aren't feeling up to it we won't be welcoming anyone until we feel ready), and made it clear that no one would be staying at our house for the first two weeks after the birth. Our family responded pretty well to that and I don't have people bothering us about whether or not the baby has come because they know that we will tell them when she's on her way. "	2	0

Do you have a family member you trust and could designate to be the contact person for your family?

**Motivation to play the game**: I think the first question every game designer should ask themself is ""Why would people want to play my game?"". RPGs (usually) have a story that tries to convince the player. Multiplayer games use the thought of competition as the main motivation for players. Other games use compelling gameplay. Think about it. Think about ""What did CH do to keep me playing it?"".

**Meaningful choices**: Giving the player meaningful choices is necessary to keep the game interesting for the player. I think CH does this pretty well: For example, players can choose between Idle and Hybrid, and both choices are valid and have their pros and cons (convenience vs. efficiency). Players can choose which relics to keep (""Atman or Kuma? Or should I try to stack Sniperino relics?""). Players can choose which quests to send mercs on, a choice that is often situational (gold quests will be better at the end of your ascenscion). Players can choose to resurect or bury mercenaries (""Should I save my rubies for the next transcenscion or should I revive my precious merc?""). All these choices make CH very interesting to play, and also contribute building a great community with lots of discussion and theorycrafting. The hard thing, of course, is to balance out the choices. Giving choices but making only a fraction of them viable is definitely the wrong way.

Complexity is adding rules and is sometimes necessary to add depth, but other times simply interrupts the flow of the game and makes it clumsy and/or slow.  
**Complexity Example:** adding Super Gilds to the game that are worth 5x a normal guild and require their own management interface and awards screen. This adds complexity, but no additional depth to the game as most players will simply put all their Super Gilds on the same hero that already has all the regular Gilds.  
**Depth Example:** the choice to add a major feature to the game like hero formations where heroes synergize based on their location in the formation. This will add some complexity, but the hope is that it adds significantly more depth to the game to justify the additional complexity. Now a player must decide which formation they will use to boost their DPS the most. If this allowed for more than just the ""invest all gilds and money into one hero"" strategy it could add significant depth. If it ended up with one perfect formation and the continuation of the one hero strategy, it would likely not be worth the additional complexity."	6	0

I play a game that involves flying a ship that has only 5 different primary weapons, which differ from each other in terms of firing rate, ammo usage, damage output, projectile speed, and shot size/spread (plus typically 3 secondary weapons -- missiles -- that are used as support.)  The way the small set of weapons interact with the space and the ships makes for an incredibly deep 1v1 game.  Pilots get into long contests involving subtle position changes, feints, etc. just to try to gain an advantage that will last for a quarter second so they can get a few extra points of damage on their opponent.

The game has 2 sequels, both of which had a lot more weapons -- higher complexity -- but they weren't as well thought out, and the games tended to collapse into ""use the most powerful insta-hit gun and have better game than the other guy"", drastically reducing the amount of depth and making for a much more boring experience overall.

I think these idle games are a perfect example as for the most part, that's ALL they are. Continually assessing your position and where it's most efficient to spend your gold/HS/AS which ancients to buy then letting the game do it's thing until you have more resources to decide where to spend.

I believe the key to a good idle game is making these decisions fun to make, easy to get an idea of roughly where it's good to spend resources, but difficult to understand exactly where to spend them to be optimal. One way clicker heroes does this is by shifting where it's optimal to spend resources (e.g. which heroes are optimal to level at what times).

The other key thing that I think people enjoy is seeing progression. Whether that's in speed, higher zones, or gaining rewards like relics/merc rewards. Pre v1.0 clicker heroes stagnated a bit at high HS. They fixed this with transcensions which acts as a second order ascension. Not the most creative or permanent fix, perhaps you could think of a better solution to this? (P.S. This works for clicker heroes as the updates are frequent.)"	2	0

he lesson of history is that these concepts of social indentity: masculinity, fatherhood, but also religious and community identity (ie. nationalism, regionalism) are flexible enough that they can mean whatever the beholder wants them to mean. With a bit of mental gymnastics, they can be made to support practically any idea (ie. the fundamentalist right and Christian Anarchists drawing on different parts of the same Christian doctrine) 

For that reason, I think your sense of masculinity can only ever be personal to you, if you're to avoid being led around by the nose by somebody else interpreting these entirely discursive concepts on your behalf. 

For me, masculinity is about concerted self-improvement, having a set of ethics that favour fairness and justice (and sticking to that code), and placing physical fitness at the centre of your life.

If it intrinsically involves authority in some way, it's about embracing being authoritative *without* compromising on your other values. imo saying 'because I said so' is probably *the least* masculine thing a man could say, because it means they are probably too weak of mind to justify their actions to another person.

Having masculinity, to me, is about being a driven, assertive, proactive, and independent individual. There's some other stuff, such as an emphasis on physicality of skills, but that's greyer and less important than the personality traits. It's not something that's specific to men, and never has been; women can be masculine just as men can be feminine. Thus, I don't see where procreation or having a wife has to factor into the equation. Are men who live alone not masculine for their singleness? I've never heard of such a thing, personally. "	6	0

Honestly, I think that the focus on the identity as **a man** isn't the best way to go. We aren't just walking penises. We're human **people** of whom some portions of us are uniquely characterized by maleness, yes, but deeper than that, we are human. Our self-identity should be composed of ALL the things that we are, and the misconception that all males should follow a checklist of behaviors might be doing more harm than good.

After all, failing that checklist or not displaying 'masculine' traits doesn't mean that a male isn't male. Regardless of how they act, they're male. And being male, their behavior contributes to the definition of what males are and what masculinity is.

Knowing one's self, acting in a manner consistent with one's values, and putting more into one's society than one takes out of it.

Our (I should say American) society has defined these particular admirable traits as masculine.

Formal education can help a lot with structured learning of the basics - composition,  color theory and editing etc.  It practical and technical skills are best learned through real world experience. 

Maybe a internship/job at a camera rental outfit? That'll get you some hands on experience with some great gear.

I went to film school and did get a Bachelors in Film with an emphasis in Cinematography, definitely not needed but it was one of my personal goals to get a college degree. You might also be interested in being a 1st AC on set, you take care of building the camera for whatever the shot calls for and get it totally ready so that the operator can just walk up to the camera and begin to roll.	1	0

On some of the bigger sets the Director of Photography (DP) takes care of calling how he wants a scene lit and shot, Camera Operator will handle the camera during the shot. Then you have your 1st AC which takes care of making sure the camera is built and ready to go for how the scene will be shot and a 2nd AC will take care of charging batteries, loading film (or managing media cards) and keeping camera logs. I haven't worked on many big sets so I recommend you do a little more research on how everything breaks down and the responsibilities of each person within the camera department but I hope this helps a bit.

Lets look at the figures based on Australian pricing which is what i have in front of me.

Office365 Business is $13.20 per user per month if paid annually. Despite one of the selling points of 365 being flexibility of month to month, for the sake of this argument lets use the annual license costings.

Over 3 years you'll pay ($13.20 * 12) * 3 = $475.20 in total. 

Now lets look at Home &amp; Business. This retails at ~$280.00 all in, however for our arguments sake let's say $300.

So over the same 3 year period your paying an additional $175.00.

Now realistically most businesses stretch out the life of their computers. Our average age is about 5 years at present, and often after that 5 year period the computers might be replaced, but the old ones will be used for other less essential purposes. So less call the average life 6 years.

So looking at our figures again. Office365 over 6 years your paying $950.40 vs $300 or a premium of $650.40. Another way to look at this is you could buy 3 licenses outright which is generally enough for a single user and still be in front.

Now there's the argument of having the latest version. Unfortunately i don't buy into this. With the above 3 year scenario - you could buy the latest office version at each release and still be coming out in front. However realistically the basic functions of office haven't changed a great deal in the past 10 years, there's been a lot of cosmetic changes but i can still type and edit a letter or do a spreadsheet or send an email on Office 2007 just as i can with Office 2016.

The only scenario where the customer comes out ahead financially is where they use all 5 device licenses. However if a single person requires 5 devices to do their job, i think there's a problem. Generally what happens here is that 5 device license ends up on their kids computer, their wifes computer and the sisters computer - and this is technically in breach of license.

The only other scenario where is semi works is in seasonal businesses that scale up to large numbers for a short period of time. However you pay a premium again ($15.95 vs $13.20) to pay monthly, and you would need to allow for the labour costings to install and setup, then remove office."	2	0

Office365 business is 8.50 (US) per month if you buy directly from them (and I KNOW that you can because I know people in Australia who buy it direct).   That means it's about 11.37 per month at current exchange rates.  

If you are in an environment that is still on Office 2007, then you are not in the target demographic.  Office365 is aimed at customers who want to stay current, want to stay with the full feature sets, and want to ensure an easy deployment structure for all of their employees. 

If you have 5 people in a room and your environment remains static for 5-6 years then buy office, you won't save money by doing otherwise.  

With Microsoft Office being attached to Microsoft accounts now, finding lost serial numbers isn't quite the PITA that it used to be, so one of the biggest downsides of retail software has also been mitigated by Microsoft.  

With large enterprise deployments, which is what Office365 is really targeted at, the support savings exceed the additional cost.  

Using Group Policy software deployments, we can push the right version of Microsoft Office to hundreds of employees as they turn on their computers and it will always be up to date with almost no interaction.  

The users just have to login to their Office365 accounts (most of these use E3 licenses that include Office, Email, unlimited Archiving, and Legal Hold features)

If you want to buy MAK keys to accomplish the same thing, they're $508 USD per seat activation.  For many mid sized companies it is much easier to pay 10,000 a month for email, sharepoint, and Microsoft Office rather than putting up $250,000 all at once for Office, buying Sharepoint licenses, buying exchange licenses and CAL's, etc.   

The cost of ownership when you take into account Storage and maintenance and labor is often LESS.   Again...this does NOT apply to mom and pop shops, but you aren't the specifically targeted market...that said...it doesn't mean you can't benefit the same way with easier support (especially if you're supporting those small businesses rather than owning one).

Since I am just a random internet person, I’ll explain my basis for saying this:

1) The determination of paladin status in QFG2 has been extensively tracked and analyzed, from the makers of the unofficial remake, to discussion of griffon slaying being an absolute bar as an oversight, to criteria lists in the official hint book (the one with the red decoder). Nothing has ever been raised about QFG1 conduct.

2) Creators of export file editors have done some heavy analysis of what few flags are contained in the files. No discovery of anything like this.

3) It is very rare to have anything from a prior game take effect. For example, beat QFG1 without defeating Baba Yaga, and the game will still assume you did in QFG4.

4) Thief characters can become paladins in QFG2 if they avoid the thief quests in that game. Many people have done it, and no one has ever reported a problem based on their QFG1 conduct, despite pretty much all of those thief characters having done those earlier quests."	10	0

They don't *have* to offer as many protections for debit cards but most of them do.

On the 530 days...  The best thing for me was the addiction recovery meetings. Not the meetings themselves but the people I met and got to know.  Realizing that I’m just a normal guy with normal issues like everyone else there really minimized my shame and guilt.

That \~1.4x more damage from Nats 6pc is completely overshadowed by gear slots you have to sacrifice to stick in Nats, which can give up to \~4.5x more damage (and that's without counting potential damage increase from possibility of mainhanding Oddysey's instead of Dawn). Only advantage is that 60%dr more, but you could instead swap CoE for Elusive Ring, making GoD6 as tanky as N6GoD4, but still better in terms of damage."	5	0

That would mean your doing more dmg right. Now Strafe, vengence, rain of vengence, as well as my primary ability are all buffed compared to just the primary, no?	0	0

Like, fraction of what your Strafe casted primaries are doing, thus this factor is negligible in comparison between hybrid and pure GoD build.	4	0

No. Lets take the N6G4 variant and to keep it simple lets say your Primary Skill (Hungering Arrow), Strafe, Vengeance and Rain of Vengeance all deal 100 damage.

Now all 4 would get the 14000% buff like you said but then you have these other buffs:

GoD 2-piece =&gt; 200% for primary attacks only

Hunters Wrath =&gt; 200% for primary attacks only

Depth Diggers =&gt; 100% for primary attacks only

The Ninth Cirri Satchel =&gt; 600% for hungering arrow only

Simplicity's Strength Gem =&gt; 65% for primary attacks only (at lv80 for example)

ALL other buffs (e.g. CoE or Focus and Restraint) you would use in the build are general damage buffs like N6 and i will ignore them here because they would just inflate the damage of all skills equally.

But lets now look at how much damage each skill does after we take the listed buffs + N6 into account:

Strafe: 100 \* 141 = 14100

Vengeance: 100 \* 141 = 14100

Rain of Vengeance: 100 \* 141 = 14100

Hungering Arrow: 100 \* 141 \* 3 \* 3 \* 2 \* 7 \* 1.65 = **2931390**

So all damage from Strafe + Vengeance + Rain of Vengeance is less than 1% of the damage Hungering Arrow does. In reality with the correct damage values and the amount of hits you deal with Hungering Arrow this gap just increases."	3	0

Why? Not only does it actually have less base stamina. It also has absolutely atrocious bleed recovery. You take advantage of that and the fact it has to sit to recover stamina where as you don't. Your ambush and trot also leaves it in the dust. This makes Giga the ideal Shant hunter. You can dodge it more effectively than a Trex for prolonged periods and you don't have to go in nearly as often and risk getting pancaked to apply lethal damage/cripple it. You just play your bleed game as you would vs. any other large game.	4	0

First thing to realize is that your not weird. Being submissive/ liking femdom is normal. Being submissive isn't a gender role thing. 

Its important to be yourself but also I would say dont look at this porn/community and think you need to act a certain way. Don't lose yourself because ""this is how you should act"" and that goes for all things in life. 

If you were to look at me you wouldn't guess that im a sub (well switch but leaning a bit more towards sub if I'm being honest). I'm a fairly muscular, charismatic guy that takes charge of a lot of things in life. 

My advice for you in do a bit of soul searching find what you like and what you don't. There are quite a bit of things in the femdom area that I personally can't stand and I think thats really important. Because when you find a dom you're gonna need to talk about what you like and what you don't like. 

Wishing you the best of luck my man. Welcome to the community and good job coming out of your shell and talking about it."	3	0

As previously mentioned, there's nothing wrong with any of this. The majority of us are completely normal in the public eye!
I fully relate do your comment about how people wouldn't think you're a sub- my ex used to love the fact that at work and out in public I'd seem like a masculine and dominant guy, yet as soon as we got a private moment she'd be putting me right back in my place. She loved that sort of thing as it really added to the naughtiness of it all, and the majority of people I've spoken to about it agree.

The one comment I just have about your original post which I want to mention (and I might be reading this wrong), is the emotionally submissive part. You should still be emotionally independent. There's two reasons I say this. Firstly, 99% of women want to be looking after a man to the extent that he's not fully mentally sound. Submission is fun when you're playing, but just don't be too needy 24/7. She'll get bored quick. Secondly, don't get yourself taken advantage of through relying too heavily on a woman for things like that. You might, like many of us, enjoy submitting, but it goes both ways. If you're not comfortable with something, say so. Any good person will respect you and your boundaries.


I realise I may have come across a little negative in places, but I don't mean to be, it was just that one comment which caught my eye. Stay safe, and I'm sure you'll have many exciting, kinky sessions in the future!

Have fun! 😉"	1	0

I’m still a sane person who can rely on myself, I meant I’m pretty alone and I need someone to rely on from time to time and it would be great to have that since I don’t and now that I think about really never had that before. Like I said on the outside I’m pretty masculine and confident and on the inside I’m just a good boy.

Your partner isn't standing up to their mother and would likely be upset that you're trying to get involved, which just implies this is a self-inflicted issue that she doesn't want to have revealed due to embarrassment.

Mom is not required to buy her special food if she won't bother eating what is available, that is not abuse.
If she is that underweight, CPS could insist on therapy for your girlfriend.

However, if there is food in the house and she is just being picky, there is nothing CPS will do.  A kid underweight due to not eating or wanting certain foods is not being abused.  Mom not catering and buying her special things due to her pickiness is not abuse."	1	0

NIN is based on one minute cycles, where you use Trick Attack and try to use as many cooldowns and Ninjutsu as possible during that time. Outside of Trick Attack you use your 1-2-3 combo and make sure you don't lose Huton. 

To play well, the primary thing most people fail at is always be doing something. When there are three or more enemies you should be using your AoE moves (including ninjutsu! If they'll stay alive for a bit use the dirt cloud, else use the fireball). When it's just one enemy try to cycle your 1-2-3 and Trick Attack every minute, during which you'll want to use Kassatsu and all of your ninjutsu, weave Ninki if you have it, Dream within a Dream and Assassinate, etc. 

Always try to keep your Global Cool Down rolling (like your 1-2-3 moves) and try to use abilities that don't activate the GCD inbetween them. GCD abilities are your primary source of damage, not just because you use them the most but because they tend to do heavier hits too. 

If you work on trying to always be doing something you'll be better than 80% of all players! It's a game, hit buttons! It's better if they're in the right order but just not standing there doing nothing is the biggest upgrade you can do."	2	0

When I play, I do the base nin combo, and try to put doton and feint on enemy. Then while I wait for cool down to refresh, I just try to damage the enemy as best as I can with remaining abilities. My knowledge has primarily been from the novice training course in the game on how to play melee dps.

So - I'm not an expert nin, but I can see some problems here.

1) Huton. You want to start every fight by having this active. It lets you use your abilities faster, which in turn will significantly raise your damage.

2) Suiton -&gt; Trick Attack should be a priority for using your ninjitsu. Trick Attack causes the target to take extra damage for 15 seconds, effectively buffing the damage output of your whole party. You should be looking to land this every time trick attack is off cooldown (and then following it up with some of your bigger attacks like Dream within a Dream and Assassinate)

3) Doton is great for fighting several enemies at once, but in a single target scenario consider using Raiton instead. It's 800 potency (vs the 900 of doton, if the target stays in the circle for the whole thing) and one less mudra to cast.

4) You have two base nin combos; one that ends with Aeolian Edge, one that ends with Armor Crush. You want to be using the armor crush one often enough to not loose your huton buff."	11	0

When there's less than 3 enemies on the field, you use Trick Attack instead. When you see high level Ninja use Doton in raids and stuff, it's pre-pull (meaning before the boss is actually aggroed) to try and get extra dps at the start of the fight, but they don't try and keep Doton up as the fight goes on.

You use Trick Attack by pressing three Mudra buttons, ending with the Jin button. This activates the Suiton button, which when used gives you a buff that lets you do Trick Attack in combat.

You try and mash as many of your damage cooldowns into that Trick Attack window as possible, including your DoT (Shadow Fang), your Ninki skills (Hellfrog - AOE, Bhacavra - single target, Bunshin - on cooldown), Ten-Chi-Jin, Assassinate, as many Raiton, etc as you can. Optimising requires a specific order of cooldown presses for maximum damage, but for the most part just try your best to fit everything in when you're just doing story content.

Outside of Trick Attack, just keep Huton up by using Armor Crush periodically and keep pressing 123, using Raiton when your Mudra are about to cap, using Bhacavra when your Ninki is about to cap, etc. 15 seconds of button spam, 45 seconds of relaxation.

Feint isn't that useful in random content, it's more to reduce the damage of boss attacks in raids where there's massive physical damage going out. But most massive damage attacks are magical, so...

The biggest ""cringe"" I see with random Ninjas is not using Trick Attack ever because they don't realize they can. As long as that Trick Attack goes out and you keep clicking buttons and dodging AOEs, I'll never notice anything else and I'll consider your job well done."	1	0

For a dps on normal contents just make sure your gear is updated at 50,60 and 70 and you are constantly attack when GCD finish cool down and utilize all your oGCD then you are good dps already.

Worry about perfecting your rotation when you want to do harder contents like extreme and savages or even ultimates. 

You can practice perfect rotation if you like min/max playstyle. But you don’t have to do that to “not burdening your group” on normal contents. 14 is very casual on normal contents."	-6	0

Huton should always be up. Do Huton, and refresh the Huton speed buff by doing the Armor Crush combo when the buff starts ticking low. Doton is for dungeons where there is lots of enemies, just like Katon is for lots of enemies. For single boss, use Raiton. For single boss, also use Suiton so you can use Trick Attack (must land on enemy's rear, use True North to garantee it). 

When Mudra is not up, use your basic combo (Death Blossom for big group of enemies, you get the second combo to it later on I think).

Tips: you can reset your Mudra by using Hide if you have no aggro/nothing on your enemy list. Practice making that a habit, it gives you one extra use out of Mudra!"	1	0

Written as a ballet, it goes through various sections that bleed into each other, and the final track is a medley of the rest of the pieces. The songs are titled as ""Track A solo dancer"" ""Track B duet solo dancers"" ""Track C group dancers"" and all them mixed in for different sections of the medley at the last track ""Track D"". The album could be fun for some to analyze, but it's clearly about Mingus and the Anima, him being the black saint and opposite being the sinner lady. The different amount of dancers and being grouped in as solos and solos as a duet signify a lack of wholeness, group gets a bit more whole, and the medley integrating all the different aspects of whoever the black saint is (assuming that's the protagonist). The album is amazing though with or without an analytical lens, probably better without it."	1	0

I thought that her profile was cool as shit, and was really hoping I could have some form of interaction with her. I mean, I'm fine with the current endings as is, I just thought it'd be rad. Oh! And I found myself majorly crushing on Mat by the end of my first playthrough, so I dunno, he would also be a cool candidate. I know the games not really about dating, as much as it is about growing pains and going through adolescent angst, but the idea was still cool to me.	3	0

Then on top of that, you give the private keys of that token to someone else, in the hope  of ever getting it back with interest. This isnt exactly risk-free. If it where, the exchanges and token issuers wouldnt be paying you, they would ""stake"" their own money on their own platform. The fact they dont, and for instance the winklevii keep their enormous coin stash in cold storage and arent staking them on their own platforms should tell you all you need to know. They apparently think the risk isnt worth the rewards, and they know more about that risk than you do.

I think the least risky way is using DAI and using to provide liquidity on some decentralized exchange. There is still a tiny risk that DAI value collapses (black swan event) but unlike tether and others, that risk is quantifiable and public and not an unknowable counter party risk. And then there is a protocol risk of either DAI or the DEX where you stake it, its not impossible someone someday discovers a vulnerability in either."	6	0

Whats worse, because you do not know the risk, and dont even seem to want to assess the risk, all these companies only have an incentive to take on ever bigger risks in order to promise you high rewards.  **Because its your money they are risking, not their own**.

Essentially your game saves the world by parts/meshes (.envc) and loads from the last save state on the save file, so replacing the contents inside the last save state should work.

Always make a back-up.

I'd advise on only replacing/adding the contents that don't reset every in-game week such as major cities. Copying and pasting their .envc file to the latest save state. This keeps their changes in that city and their chests.

WARNING, there is a RISK!  
Most likely it'll create an empty save state and reset your world but not your character (As it saves the character and their inventory differently). This can be fixed by going to each location that you want to load in then saving/leave to menu and finally placing the location's .envc file that you want inside the last/latest save state. Next time you load in your character, the place you left off on should update to the one you placed in.

Now should you try it? Why not, I'd suggest trying it on a brand new character or something first and see if it works that way. Just know that it has a risk of resetting your world including your cities and a hassle of loading their previous states.

Hopes this helps, apologies if this isn't what you wanted."	1	0

You will save a shitload of money, at least 50%, even without negotiating, and end up with a piece of jewellery that is just as good as what you can get from Cartier, Tiffany etc. My wife works for LVMH-Tiffany and tells me all the time the people buying jewellery from these brands are complete suckers, only thing you should ever go original on is watches.	5	0

I have custom jewelry manufactured in different popular jewelry workshops in the Subcontinent which snap and break along soldered joints under the slightest amount of pressure. I have a collection of Tiffany silver jewelry bought over a few decades (some purchased regionally) that has been frequently worn, and I haven’t had issues with earring-backings snapping off, chains twisting, clasps becoming mis-aligned and no longer closing, etc.	1	0

There's ban waves, then there are new updates and new accounts get made, and the cycle repeats. Sometimes there are free trial  periods that increase the amount. I also noticed less hackers lately but I  really am not playing during this playlist cycle, so I don't know if there are more today or not. I don't know if there is anything specific about buy backs that makes hacking easier or whatever other than there obviously being more easy targets to kill.	1	0

Baker's injury is to his non throwing arm. He'll be fine with the brace. Champ Bailey played multiple seasons with a shoulder tear also. Only issue Browns have is health at WR and getting OBJ on track with Baker.	0	1

&gt; Home tests will miss some infections and in rare cases mistakenly indicate an infection. One popular test misses around 15 out of 100 infections 

That presumes the person is symptomatic. 

They do say (as you indicate): 

&gt; But Arwady said ""you can feel confident"" with results from such tests if they are taken within 24 hours of a gathering.

&gt; ""Even on the unlikely event [those tested] actually have COVID and don't know it, they are unlikely to have COVID at a level that they're going to spread it,""

But I'd like to see the justification for that statement. It certainly doesn't seem justified by what comes a bit later:

Then they say:

&gt; ""So if someone is having symptoms and they get a negative test, one, it depends on the severity right? If you're having severe symptoms we don't want you to just do a home test either,"" she said. ""We want you to call your doctor's office and make sure that they have an opinion here because there are of course other things like the flu that are out there that can mimic symptoms or have similar symptoms.

Ok, so if you test negative and have severe symptoms, call your doctor anyway. So what's the point of at home testing in the case of severe symptoms?

&gt; But if you're having symptoms and they're kind of mild and lingering and you use the test and it's negative, we want you to take the precautions and then retest in three to five days.""

So if you have mild symptoms and get a negative, don't trust it. Ok, so what's the point of testing with mild symptoms?

&gt; “If you had a high risk exposure and/or are symptomatic and you have a negative test, it still may be worthwhile to get a formal test done in a hospital lab.”

Ok... if you had an exposure and test negative, get a formal (PCR) test. So what's the point of these tests at all?

And they don't even mention taking a test if you're asymptomatic and not exposed (because the false negative rate is so high)."	2	0

1) The results stated there come from the manufacturers and differ wildly from the CDC's estimates (probably at least in part due to #2). 

2) The results of all antigen tests are compared to PCR tests as the ground truth, but the PCR tests themselves have much higher false negative rates (10-20%) than these tests are trying to imply:

How would you be able to quantify spread without breaking ethical rules? You’d have to have a cohort of people being tested multiple times a day by multiple testing methods then tracking their spread to others as well as logging their symptoms… 

I think what they’ve been doing is testing culture-able virus but even at that point, viable virus in culture does not indicate ability to spread.

I think we have to think about what we consider a negative test. Is a single virus in your whole body a positive? Or does the capacity to spread virus considered a positive? I think this study’s threshold of “clinical suspicion” is a weird one. There really is no better test to evaluate infection other than observation of symptoms which are shared with many other illnesses, so I’m struggling to understand this study and how it proves that PCR is only 80% accurate. Repeat tests, even short periods of time apart, could mean that the virus has been able to get a foothold in between tests since they replicate exponentially. Frankly, a negative test shortly after exposure is not a false negative to me — it’s simply reflecting that you aren’t sick yet, even if you have the potential to be. The biggest problem I’ve heard regarding PCR is that it displays false positives long after a patient has fully recovered and there is no longer viable virus in their body."	1	0

Yes, indeed. So why do we have doctors stating opinions without evidence? We know asymptomatic spread occurs. We don't know at what level it stops. Why are we pretending we do?

There are many studies that discuss the false negative rate of pcr tests with different ways of determining ground truth. I've never seen one quote less than 10% in a clinical setting, and that's when taken at the ideal time.  Antigen tests are necessarily worse.

There is a general understanding among epidemiologists that there needs to be a threshold of virus in the body before the load is sufficient from which to be spreadable. The RT-PCR test is accurate, per your own link, of detecting presence of vial RNA &gt;99% of the time assuming a sufficient copy number in the sample which is very small. Sure, someone could have virus below that threshold and then become sick later, but that is very close timewise after initial exposure. The antigen test has a higher threshold but during early infection when copy number is high and you are limited in your symptoms, you might even consider yourself asymptomatic, it should show up positive, which tests show the vast majority of the time. 

If you plan to come be with someone for longer than 24 hours, your best bet is to take a rapid test every day for a few days if you have concerns about exposure or they are particularly vulnerable."	1	0

""Based on this analysis, the false-negative rate for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR is shockingly high, even at its lowest on day 8 post-exposure, or 3 days after symptoms. At its best, one out of five people suspected of COVID-19 will test negative. If clinical suspicion is high, infection should not be ruled out on the basis of RT-PCR alone.""

The LS430 is a reliable car if well maintained, however when it does need work it is not cheap. For example let’s say your starter goes out, that’s about a $180 dollar part, but it is mounted in the V of the engine which requires removing the intake manifold.  A dealership would charge about 1200 to 1500 in labor. 

A knock sensor may go out making the car run rough, the genuine sensor is $200-$300 and there’s 2, and they are in the V of the engine so to replace the 2 knock sensors would be about $1600 - $2100 at a dealer but you might as well put in a new starter and change the coolant bypass tube while you are in there easily making this a $2500+ dollar repair. 

Will the car last for ever if properly maintained? Yes
Will it be cheap to keep the car properly maintained? No

If the car has a good track record and had many of the things I mentioned fixed then it should be a good buy, but don’t get into an old luxury car thinking it will be as cheap as a Mercury. 

Another thing to keep in mind is that LS430’s run better on premium gas. On average I pay about 85$ to 90$ to fill up my tank every 320 miles or so. 

All that being said, the LS430 is a fantastic car, and if you can find a well maintained example at a good price I would definitely go for it. It’s lovely to drive and has a lot of modern conveniences. The interior is also a lovely place to be."	3	0

I almost purchased a Acura TL instead of this and I’m glad I went with the Lexus. I work on my vehicles, I feel like the parts aren’t that expensive. In the five years of my ownership of the LS, the only thing it’s needed outside of regular maintenance was the knock sensors and the castor bushings. 

All told, I’m in about 800 bucks for “emergency” maintenance. 

I fill it with oil and gas, change the filters, that’s it. It’s been the easiest going, most reliable vehicle I’ve ever owned. I never knew car ownership could be like this. I’m not afraid of driving my car and something popping up unexpectedly anymore. I have a 2003 Modern Lux with 193k on it, and it drives like it has half that. I don’t worry about miles on the 3UZ. 

I’m so in-tune with this machine now, that I can tell when something is amiss before it gets bad, but it doesn’t even. 

Yeah, gas mileage isn’t the best, I get 12.5-13.5 in city and about 18-21 on the HWY. For what it is though, a big V8, it’s decent. But I’ve only driven vehicles with 10MPG or less, so this is great to me. 

As long as the LS you’re looking at has been maintained, it’ll just keep going. Timing belt every 9yrs/90k mi, one of the most important things. Take care of it, it’ll take care of you, and still be running after we’re all gone."	2	0

Do the math and see what owning an LS will cost. Mine does about 23-24 on long trips. I never use it for city driving, I presume it would be utter shit. But if you're coming from a Mountaineer it may bit seem bad to you. I was coming from a 4cyl Accord so it's pretty bad from my perspective.

Honestly I drove 4cyl accords in college because they're hilariously cheap to own and don't suck to drive. Only thing that killed one is a deer. The one I have now as a winter beater has 329k on it and runs great. I drive it instead of my LS in winter because leather blows in the cold, heated or not."	1	0

My town is stupid, though, with short distances between stop signs and 50mph speed limits in town, so it kills on gas. In Los Angeles I was doing the same, though, about 14-15. Premium gas, 22.2 gallons of it. It's a great reliable highway cruiser and very nice around town. Bear in mind that the LS needs a timing belt job every 90,000 miles or 7ish years, non-negotiable (it'll tank your engine if you leave it and it breaks), so if it hasn't been done you'll probably be stuck with that bill, ~$750-$1500 depending on where you go. I wouldn't get an Acura, honestly, but it could be fine. Their reliability has never been on par with Lexus', and unlike Lexus all the Acuras I've been in really are just tarted up Hondas. Lexus is not just a fancy Toyota, they actually share very few parts.	2	0

If he can’t even watch a video or read information about what you struggle with daily that affects both of you…he’s really not worth it and you can do a lot better."	8	0

It seems like he’s being very honest about not caring at all, and I think you should take that and accept it. This is his true colors and you should probably not be in a relationship with him. It just reeks of selfishness, lack of concern for you, and insensitivity. Love is verb dude, cut your losses and go.	3	0

So it’s not even as if you are trying to educate him on a disorder or an illness that doesn’t impact him or anything, telling partners about BPD in particular &amp; educating them on what to expect is ESSENTIAL. In fact I *personally* think it’s “unethical” in a way, not to tell romantic partners about BPD, as it’s a relationship that in many cases acts up a LOT when it comes to dating. 

Obviously not all people with BPD are like this but I very much *am* - I don’t cope easily. I’m not abusive but I self harm and I’m a lot to handle. Which is why I let my partners know about my BPD &amp; try to educate them on it - so they’d at least be aware of what to expect and if they feel the need, let go of that relationship while it’s early on instead of things escalating later on.

BPD is a difficult illness. Your bf’s dismissal is honestly dangerous for both of you &amp; a huge red flag. I say leave him before you get too attached because this is not going to end well if things continue like this."	1	0

Let alone for those who don't. However ifs he's clued up and knows the score or you have tried to explain the effects of BPD on a persona/relationship etc and why this is affecting you in life, and he's still not interested get him in the bin. He will only make you worse and cause all sorts of trigger responses with his lack of care and support.	1	0

It WILL affect your partner - whether you have a full blown meltdown, or lash out at them or have trouble with emotional regulation. Whatever it may be, your partner will more often than not, bear the brunt of it. And from an ethical perspective, you absolutely did the right thing by being open and honest about your diagnosis. 

He’s not a bad person for not having “space in his head” to deal with it. Having a partner with BPD is emotionally taxing and as harsh as this sounds, he has every right to not want to be with you if he can’t handle the mental pressure of being with someone who has BPD. The fact that he has no interest in learning about it could also stem from the fact that he doesn’t have the mental capacity for it. It’s not disrespectful, although I do think he should have chosen his words more carefully. He came off ignorant, selfish and dismissive which in turn, has left you feeling like he doesn’t love YOU. 

That being said, you’re not overreacting. Hearing that from someone you love fucking sucks. But for your own sake, I hope you make the right decision and leave before it’s too late. Accept the harsh reality that he can’t be what you need. And you can’t be in a relationship with someone who won’t accept all of you. The fact that you’re considering ending the relationship is a huge step in the right direction. The right person will be willing to learn, support and grow with you, despite how difficult your BPD makes things.  Don’t settle!"	1	0

Even before last week, some companies included Planned Parenthood and other women’s health nonprofits in those companies’ employee donations-match programs. And sometimes, those amounts can be substantial. For instance, a previous employer’s program matched up to $3,000/year of an employee’s donations to nonprofits approved for matches from that program.	7	0

For instance, my state's governor recently announced that my state's government will give a substantial amount to the abortion access fund in our state because that fund has been getting so many out-of-state inquiries from women seeking abortions in my state.

I also recommend looking into helping organizations that help women with whatever choice they decide to make: whether they decide to go through with an abortion, give up the child for adoption, or to keep the child or consider co-parenting. For instance, my city has a local nonprofit doula group that helps pregnant women, new mothers, women who have undergone abortions or are considering adoption or co-parenting, and women recovering from miscarriages, and who need support because they feel overwhelmed or alone during the whole experience."	4	0

No one deserves grounds for plotting acts of domestic terrorism. And we've seen countless acts of evangelical-driven folks that take their practice and make some overarching comments about women and sexual constructs. Some to go as far as physically organizing to kill other people based on their differences in race, sex, and sexual orientation. And I don't think we should ignore the fact that most of this organization begins in church groups. Freedom of religion yet you're seeing those same people band together to limit the freedoms of anyone else that stands outside of their religious POV.

The first comment is not in any way that I can see celebrating Trump being ill, but hopeful that it might have positive outcomes given the situation at that time. Furthermore, the OP of that post replied with: ""My main point was to encourage people not to rejoice because something bad happened to someone they don’t like.""

The second comment is at least admitting that their natural response is not good. And it is a comment on a post entitled:

""Taking joy in Trump or anyone else catching the coronavirus is not Christian not Biblical""

And the third comment is, again, IMO, not taking any satisfaction in it, the fact that Trump made poor decisions about his personal risk of Covid is hardly unrealistic. Trump ignored medical advice, and he had only just been making fun of Biden for wearing a mask.

&gt; Anyone who dared to show an ounce of support to Trump when he had COVID back then was roundly downvoted and told they were evil.

I've had a look through the three posts that you linked and can find little or any real evidence of that. The most downvoted comments are in disagreements about the effetiveness or otherwise of travel bans. Then someone is downvoted for saying isn't karma a bitch, and two more for making pretty much the same accusation that you have despite the lack of evidence in those very comments."	17	0

For example, you can’t enroll your child into daycare or school without their vaccines, and all military personnel are required to be up to date on their shots. Historically, we’ve even enforced harsher quarantine measures; when the Spanish Flu was spreading the U.S. government mandated masks be worn in public, state governments shut down major festivals to stem the spread, and in some cases had the National Guard deployed to *force* people to stay in their homes. 

The vaccine mandate wasn’t even mandatory for the most part. You could still turn it down, just don’t expect to be able to freely travel because you’re more of a risk to spread or contract the virus, which would only cause further strain on the medical system. Being held liable for personal choices does not equal being forced to do something. You can also drink and drive, but will be arrested, for example.

Little fun fact, people also protested seatbelt laws too in the name of “personal freedom.” Same shit, different stupidity. 

The vaccine mandate was only illegal in the minds of conservatives who believe everything that they personally don’t like or gives them a minor inconvenience is a crime. Y’all are the real snowflakes ❄️❄️."	8	0

And, since you’ve opened up the floor to questioning someone’s faith, are *you* a Christian? Can you faithfully and truthfully recite the Nicene Creed, which has been the standard of Christianity for nearly 2,000 years? Can you say, with total honesty and faith:

*I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and Earth and of all things visible and invisible.*

*And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the only-begotten, begotten of the Father before all ages. Light of light; true God of true God; begotten, not made; of one essence with the Father, by Whom all things were made; Who for us men and for our salvation came down from Heaven, and was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary, and became man. And He was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered, and was buried. And the third day He arose again, according to the Scriptures, and ascended into Heaven, and sits at the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again with glory to judge the living and the dead; Whose Kingdom shall have no end.*

*And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of Life, Who proceeds from the Father; Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; Who spoke by the prophets.*

*In one Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church. I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins. I look for the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. Amen.*"	5	0

Trump was controlled opposition, but atleast he was entertaining. Atleast the economy was better, and we weren't the laughing stock of the world. The legacy of the Trump administration is a supreme court that will provide victories in terms of adhering to the constitutional values our founding fathers set forth, along with moral policies.

It's interesting how you cut off the part about Burisma, or kicking up ten percent. If it were Trump Jr., it would be on the news 24/7, but the media loves to play defense for the Bidens. Again, it's (D)ifferent.

&gt;The election fraud has been so thoroughly disproven I'll just refer you to my original comment.

You people think the ends justify the means, and if God himself came down with concrete evidence of the fraud, you'd turn on CNN, and pontificate to the Lord that ""akshually, that was deboonked.""

&gt;It was widely understood as a disaster and a human rights issue, as seen by the rest of the globe distancing themselves from us for that unthinkable step backwards.

Life begins at conception. Simple as. Leftists see a single celled life form on Europa and go soyfaced. ""OMG, LOOK! LIFE! HOW HECKIN' AWESOME!"". But a human child is to be murdered in the mother's womb out of inconvenience, a sacrifice to Moloch in the modern era.

&gt;Sure, you let me know how many suicides by firearm and school shootings are worth your freedom, and I'll mark you down once we've passed that number to change your vote!

There is no number of shootings that would influence my decision on the Second Amendment. Shall not be infringed. Molon labe. Take the case of that recent mall shooter who got taken out in 15 seconds by a good guy with a gun.

Bill Clinton was subjected to 4 (more like 6) years of partisan investigations that never should have happened, or at least been expanded so broadly. Ken Starr investigated him for literally anything he could think of until finally, three years into investigating bogus claim after bogus claim, he FINALLY stumbled into a story of an assymetric yet consensual affair that began after his original investigation started and went after Clinton for something largely unrelated to the Presidency and threatened his family. 

Donald Trump abused actual Presidential authority to try coercing a foreign nation to target a political opponent by validating baseless conspiracy theories while also vindicating his own alleged international collusion in election tampering.

One of these was actually a partisan witch hunt and the other was a guy who later went on to attempt to overthrow American democracy. Clinton's impeachment was salacious and wrong, but it was clearly a farce and that's why he wasn't removed from office. If we're talking partisanship, a Republican-led Senate is who failed to remove him from office and the Republican special investigator who took over for Ken Starr called the whole thing a waste of time and money. 

I'm not here trying to moralize away Clinton's affair or his lying about it, but it was a far and away more partisan investigation and his acquittal wasn't partisan in nature (his party wasn't in charge of the acquittal). The idea that Trump faced no consequences because Clinton didn't is crazy."	2	0

Death is welcome, if only we are able to surrender to the lord alone (and not the desires of our bodies/flesh) when passing through that door. Then shall we in the lord’s company for eternity. 

Only the world dies and the world is not true. God and we are eternal. 

Do not mourn for a dead body, nor the living who choose death over life. This is compassion tinged by the beams in our eye. 

The lord is infinitely wise and gives no blessing or curse without perfect reason. To mourn for the passing of his judgement is to question our trust that he is all good. 

Simply show them compassion and the love of the lord so they might have the opportunity to know what is true life, and choose it. Mourning comes from fear of death (identification with body and temporary nature of the material world) and we know our souls to be eternal really.

Hardly a problem due to any of the 3 gentlemen who have been in office during those years. Not sure what would be the best solution, other than better mental health services.

Iraq withdraw seemed pretty uneventful... Perhaps you're referring to Afghanistan. That was sloppy. Not sure how it would've been different under Trump.

What could Trump have done to keep Russia from invading Ukraine? 

Border arrests are up under Biden, so sounds like he is more effective? Or he doesn't actually have that much to do with what ICE and border control do...

Congress voted to send aid to Ukraine. Biden signed it, as the president should do when a Congress elected by the American people passes a bill.

I get you don't like abortion, but wanting the right to privacy of doctors to perform abortions is not the same as ""calling for the murder of over 100 million Americans.""

We're still in Iraq, I believe you mean Afghanistan. Which was Trump's plan. Trump, who released many Taliban fighters right before he left office... Taliban fighters who have now overrun and taken control of that country. Yeah, I don't think Trump would have done much better. 

&gt;Fentanyl is coming up from mexico and killing hundreds of thousands of Americans.

A problem that's been rising since before even Trump took office is Biden's fault? 

&gt; He can't defend his own border from millions of illegal invaders

Well... that's overblown. Even the TX Army and Air National Guard aren't actually helping anything down there, but border arrests have risen. The only change in immigration policy was an ending of family separation. 

&gt;sends 80 billion to Ukraine to fight a war may people believe Trump could have at least delayed if not stopped.

Ukraine is not Biden's fault, and we've been involved there since 2014, training the Ukrainian military for exactly this fight. We're sending money because we cannot allow Putin to overrun Ukraine and then set his eyes on a NATO ally like Poland or Romania or Lithuania. We don't really want a repeat of 1939 Europe, do we?

The resulting impeachment literally only happened because a partisan hack spent *years* investigating Clinton for a dozen different things, *including killing a member of the White House Counsel* and firing people he had to power to fire, before finally landing on a coworker of Monica recording Monica telling her about the affair she was involved in. The only reason there was a court room for Bill to perjure himself on a matter unrelated to the Presidency, save for him happening to be President, is because he’d been targeted by a partisan hack who’d tried literally everything else and a separate investigation entirely regarding Paula Jones that happened to run concurrently. 

Bill Clinton can be, and is, a shitty person, but that doesn’t mean shitty things weren’t also done to him. Say what you will of the Trump impeachments, but at least Dems impeached him over the things they said they would, instead of throwing everything and seeing what stuck. Even Mueller spun out evidence of crimes unrelated to his probe to relevant agencies and focused solely on what his mandate was."	1	0

I've been driving for 22 years. About half of that has been as a delivery driver (anything from pizzas to truckloads of natural stone slabs). By your math, I've got the equivalent of 121-132 years of potential risk behind the wheel, depending on perspective.

I got my first ticket when I was 16 and stupid in a Camaro, and another as the slowest driver on the Chicago Skyway when I was 26. It is not difficult at all to NOT get a ticket in a year. Otherwise, I'd have over a hundred by now (again, going off of your math).

The older you get, the more you realize a ticket just isn't worth the few minutes you could potentially save each time you take the risk."	2	0

Number one is google search. If you simply search up, what colours go with black and red google will tell you white. From there you can piece together a colour scheme for your outfit. It's as simple as that. Google also has plenty of information on kibbe types, but personally, I would take this with a grain of salt since things like this aren't set in stone and vary from person to person as well as circumstances. There's also books on kibbe types too as well as colour schemes. I am currently reading Atomic Habits, and as one user has already pointed out in a different post, the information in that book can definitely be applied to beauty. When it comes to hairstyling and makeup I recommend youtube, that has definitely helped me. Homemade Beauty by Anne Strole is a book I'm interested in reading because I am a big believer in the exclusive use of diy beauty products, and I need more recipes.	5	0

Basically French people are taught this since their childhood: pay attention to what's wrong rather than what's good. And the country consumes more antidepressants than any other country.

French people don't have that ""je ne sais quoi"" (I see where it could come from but it's pure marketing) and so I would question the acurracy of the book's content.

I haven't read it and it probably gives good advice about how to let go but the French part of it is only cosmetic to improve sales. I guess ""je ne sais quoi"" sounds better than ""just chill out""."	4	0

I’d just heard in passing that they had good advice on accepting yourself despite your flaws and accepting aging rather than trying to look younger. I don’t mean that all French ppl act this way, and I totally agree that a lot of the French girl trope is marketing, but the whole je ne sais quois thing does seem to be in line with the whole it girl thing. That’s why I recommend them. But yeah they might not be all that great after all	2	0

I wish we could just post stuff in peace without having to worry about getting harassed by creeps.	94	0

The first few messages seemed innocent until I creeped the profile and comments were made like “I wish I was that baby” to a baby breastfeeding or “can I call you mommy” 💀💀 

Like don’t men understand that’s not flattering and it’s why they are unwanted by women.

I remember many years ago when I was a teen I tried Shazaming (Soundhound at the time) a song from a video, and when the result said Radiohead I couldn't believe it, so I tried again. Same result. I ignored it and went on with my day. Came across the video again and, who would have thought, still Nude by Radiohead. I finally gave in and went to listen to In Rainbows. Instantly became hooked, I couldn't stop listening to them, every album was so good by it's own unique reasons. Up until that point when I thought of Radiohead it was all creep, thankfully I was so, so wrong.	6	0

At MY prior institution, the policy was NO because you have already demonstrated that you have immigrant intent, and therefore no longer aligned with the J-1 program.	1	0

My 2021 Sienna FWD has 25,000 miles and I still have 6/32"" of tread remaining. I like to replace tires at 4/32"", so I am approximately 18-24 months away from new tires.  For my usage, 3-4 years between tire changes is typical.

Tire warranty claims must be tied back to the tire manufacturer's workmanship. If there is no abnormalities with the tire construction, you likely don't have a claim worth pursuing.

If you want long-lasting tires, change driving behavior first...As for tire selection, I try to compare tires within a specific brand and look at tires with UTQG of 600-800.  I have had good luck with Bridgestone Dueler Alenza and Pirelli Scorpion Verde A/S.

2010-2020 Sienna is known for consuming tires quickly...it is a heavy vehicle: 4,700lbs before occupants and cargo."	5	0

2021 Sienna tires….but the stock Bridgestones that came with my 2011 Camry wore out so quickly that I refused to ever look at that brand again. I’m not an aggressive driver and I stay on schedule with rotations. 

According to my tire guy, new cars come with soft tires so when you go for a test drive, it feels nice. Also, its whoever the car company works out a deal with. 

Long story short…Tire durability isn’t a concern of the car manufacturer."	1	0

Our last 20,000 miles. I thought the quickness of the tire wearing thin was insane. But after some research and talking to the tire shops, the run flats don’t last much longer then 20,000 miles and are very expensive!! So I decided to buy a good set of all season tires. We don’t have a spare in our 2016 awd so I purchased an air compressor that can plug into the cigarette lighter and a tire flat kit off of Amazon. Now if we completely blow a side wall we are screwed. But so far we’ve driven 50,000 miles on them with regular rotations and they still have tread. And these tires were half the price of the run flats. Brand name is Continental. Also, I choose to drive the sienna to work in the snow rather then my tundra. Handles like a champ!	3	0

Nice! If you know the model for the Continental I'd greatly appreciate it. In return I'll say watch the handle on the third row seats. We broke ours under warranty. Weren't too hard on it, but weren't too gentle either. I am more gentle now, don't let the handle slam shut or the seat."	2	0

The run flats were downright scary in the rain, felt lots of resistance going through puddles on rainy days, especially on the freeway, the van would pull really hard and just felt like it was struggling to go through shallow puddles of water. These new tires clear water way better, I barely feel any resistance driving through wet roads, compared to the run flats. I have a similar flat tire strategy, air compressor and plug kit. I've contemplated buying a spare if I'm gonna be really far away from civilization.	2	0

Yeah the run flats were definitely a harder ride too. Regular tires are much smoother. We’ve done some risky trips without a spare and just the flat kit. So I’m thinking about a spare and somehow carrying it on the van just in case a total blow out. Maybe the top, on the trunk or a tow hitch. I’ve been meaning to do research on this 🤔 I’ll definitely check those tires because honestly I need to replace before winter.	1	0

Az alkohol kiürülése a vérből nagyjából egy exponenciális görbét követ, az exponenciális görbe önhasonló (azaz durván fogalmazva még ha több ponton is méred meg a véralkoholt - bizonyos korlátok között - nem tudod eldönteni hogy régebben ittál nagyon sokat vagy nem olyan régen kevesebbet; Azt viszont igen hogy a kiürülési tartományban egy korábbi időpontban mekkora lehetett a véralkoholszint). Viszont ha két ilyen görbét egymásra teszel akkor természetesen nem tudod megmondani teljes bizonyossággal hogy egy adott korábbi időpontban mekkora volt a véralkoholszinted (azaz ha később ráiszol valamennyit azzal egy még későbbi időpontban ugyanazt a kiürülésgörbét éred el mintha korábban többet ittál volna). Így ha sem az időpontokat, sem a mennyiségeket nem ismered nem lehet teljes bizonyossággal visszaszámolni, hogy egy korábbi időpontban mekkora volt a véralkoholszinted, csak valószínűségi állításokat lehet tenni (nincs kétségem itt a legtöbb magyar bíróság már régen elvesztette a fonalat...).   
Ráadásul a kiürülési görbe egyénenként más és más, így ha semmi trükközés sincs akkor is van a mérésnek egy tekintélyes hibája...

I don't have a self-emptying base. I've been really happy with it. The J7 cleans the upstairs, then he charges, I empty his bin, knock some cat litter dust out of his filter, and take him downstairs (maybe on the same day, maybe on the next day), and he cleans the downstairs, with an easy transport by me down one step into the sunken living room at the beginning or end. I clean the filter almost every time because we have cats (and hence, cat litter dust). This works well for me. I've considered getting a second J7 so I don't have to carry one up and down the stairs, but it's just not that big of a deal. Same thing for the self-emptying base--it would be nice, but I'm dealing with the filter pretty frequently so manually dumping the bin is NBD.

&amp;#x200B;

ETA--I've been considering getting a second base, however, just so I can charge on both levels, as I understand this should work with one J7. If the self-emptying base were on sale, I'd probably do it, but $250 is too much for me to stomach..."	1	0

I’m in the process on nhs, I’m 34, I’m 2 years in and I’m not even in braces, hopefully will be in them by July. Im near London and it’s 5-8 month waits between every single tiny step or appointment, so phone your GP today and get an appointment, if successful you will be in your mid thirties by the time the operation has taken place. If you have the money or access to good loans then go private. Good luck!	2	0

My case is rather strange as I need 3 operations due to severe asymmetry the first being djs - I was actually referred to my GP from a private rhinoplasty surgeon as I can’t breathe through my nose.  GP then agreed and referred me to a maxillofacial department. 

One thing to also consider is, they will do a sleep test, I’m having one next year, and if I have sleep apnea they have to treat that first because it’s the medical angle - meaning surgery first braces after, which is really not ideal but it’s the way the nhs do it now. So I’m hoping I don’t have sleep apnea as they will perform the surgery anyway because of my other problems but with braces first."	1	0

Three physical locations. It’s kinda like the hanger method but much more obvious (granted, takes more space) and will force you to confront reality vs ideas when it comes to what you think you want to wear. 

My suggestion would be, start everything in your  main storage (where it is right now), which will start as location 1. If there are items that you wouldn’t be able to wear in the next three months because they are unseasonable, move them to a designated area to repeat the process with later. 

As you wear an item, move it to location 2 (a clothing rack, if you want). If you hated wearing it, as yourself why? If it’s any reason other than “I liked it but it wasn’t good for this season like I thought”, then consider getting rid of it instead of moving it to location 2. Also, if you loved wearing it, equally take note of why so you can start to learn what aspects work for you. If the item just wasn’t correct for the season, move it to your “out of season” designated area. 

Every day, when you get dressed, you CAN’T pull from location 2. Go back to your location 1 and pull from there.

If you absolutely need something you’ve already worn that’s now in location 2, wear it, then move it to location 3. Items that make it to location 3 will likely become “essentials”, which are the foundational pieces of your wardrobe. Again, try to avoid pulling from location 3 if you can help it, go to location 2. 

Either make your way through every single item in location 1, or figure out why it is that nothing left in location 1 is wearable, and evaluate getting rid of those items. If you have too many items and didn’t get thru them all because the season changed first, that is also valuable information that could help you prioritize what you keep. 

Once you’re done, either move everything back and repeat the process (the more times you’re forced to wear an item, the more realistic you will be about if it truly fits in your life). Or, if you feel confident, make a capsule. If the seasons have changed, swap stuff, and repeat the process."	23	0

You need secure protector or edge protector on both tackles, you need either secure protector or nasty streak on guards depending on scheme. Center you need secure protector. WRs and TEs you need Short in elite and you need deep out elite. QB you need a fast release or gunslinger as well as Set Feet Lead/pass lead elite as well as Fearless and/or HRM. 

The other 15 percent is knowing the mechanics of the game. What’s going to beat man coverage (short in elite toasts man) and how to stuff insta sheds from inside stuff DTs. When running if they only have 1 inside stuff DT you need to double team him every run. If they have two try your hardest to run outside and away from them (tosses stretch and other outside runs)

Passing wise, don’t do anything rash, a 3 yard flat route is better than an interception. Too many people care about the big plays and don’t understand that that isn’t how the nfl works. Most big plays are a blown assignment and are rarely schemed open. Most offenses care about picking up 4-5 yards every time and hope they can nab a big 15-20 yard play every few times. Be patient and don’t force the ball when not needed."	11	0

You might be onto something, the RAMS playbook is designed for big plays and it worked very well when teams were in the mid 80s.

2 ways to think about it:

Feminism is about being able to choose what you who to be. In a way a compulsory rejection of all things stereotypical gives the patriarchy about as much power over you, as it would, if you felt like it was compulsory to be stereotypical. 

2nd: You are gender non conforming in regards to what you were assigned at birth. That alone can be pretty hard in a patriarchal world. In a way femboys are expanding on a different way to be a man or boy, softening up the rigid expectations. You just being you is hella valid, you don't have to conform to anything or change the way you present to be a feminist or an ally. You could be hyperfemine and be a feminist or the most stereotypical lumberjack dude could be a feminist as well. It's a lot more about how you treat people &amp; what you expect of them."	15	0

This is her video from a few months ago discussing hyper-femininity and current bimbo culture. She starts with a break down of the current aesthetic and trends, then gets into the history and societal stereotypes and gendered expectations, and then brings it all together by discussing the implications and ramifications. IMO she does a great job pointing out the progressive and regressive sides of this.  Hope this is helpful."	3	0

It is not ascribed to you by society. It's not your place, so to speak. What you are ""supposed"" to be is masculine. That is what society tells you (and everyone around you).

By engaging in feminine-coded self-expression, you are challenging the boundaries imposed on you, though, and therefore also the boundaries imposed on anyone's gender expression. If society accepts an individual who is expected to act and dress ""masculine"" expressing ""feminity"" instead, that is a sign of progress, in my opinion.

I think it is your ""job"" to rebel against oppressive societal expectations, especially as a young person. If you do that by challenging gender norms, that's perfectly fine in my opinion. It would also be fine if you did that by cultivating a more healthy masculinity. All I care about is that you take care of your mental health and not hurt others. If you end up helping others, directly or indirectly, that is a bonus in my book but not an expectation.

If the feeling that you have to rebel against traditionally feminine things weighs heavily on you, I would probably suggest you explore the possibility of being trans or if maybe you were parentified as a child. This kind of thing isn't your responsibility and it shouldn't weigh on you that heavily."	1	0

Womanhood is not defined through suffering or martyrdom. To participate in or enjoy feminine-coded self-expression, you do not have to be a martyr, either.

My friend, you do you. Feminity and masculinity are social constructs. Linking them with dress and appearance and interests was a weird idea in the first place. Everyone should be able to freely express themselves. It does not affect their worth or their capabilities. There is no reason to think that all men must be interested in cars and all women must like romance, but there is also no reason to assume that a woman who likes romance is doing a disservice to womanhood or that a man who likes cars is doing a disservice to manhood."	2	0

I think it will be mostly TERFs and the un-reflected who would give you pushback for ""appropriating femininity"". To that I would say: Femininity does not belong to those people any more than it does to anyone else. If your authentic self-expression involves feminine elements or even a ""hyperfeminine"" presentation, that is fine.

It is your right to explore and it is your right to present yourself the way feels right to you. This may make some people feel uncomfortable, especially if they were harshly punished as children for crossing gender boundaries themselves. But that does not make those gender boundaries right or give them the right to pass on the limitations they experienced themselves.

It is your life to control, not theirs, so others do not get to tell you how to self-express any more than you do them. It is only if you attached ideas of ""women have to be this way and men have to be that way"" that you'd be crossing boundaries, in my opinion.

All that being said, I would expect some pushback from more ""conservative"" or ""traditional"" types. The way things are right now, you unfortunately cannot expect everyone to be accepting. But you should not let that deter you from cultivating a healthy life and self-expression. And I see no reason at all why liking feminine-coded things like the ones you mentioned should make you a bad feminist or feminist ally."	2	0

Abt the points you made. 

1/ Feminism has long been intersectional with GNC liberation. It goes both ways of allowing women to wear traditionally masculine clothing and allowing men to wear traditionally feminine clothing. Feminists will defend your right to be a femboy.

(Though TERFs might call it 'womanface' but a TERF recently literally openly quoted Hitler in a speech and got cheers from the crowd sooo....)

2/ We live in a society. Yes you might want to account for capitalism to an extent but no matter what your desired aesthetic is/was you have to do that.

Like theres things you can do and say which could be sexist or bigoted as a femboy. E.g. if you call yourself a 'trap' or 'transvestite' - or if you lean heavily into sexist stereotypes and try to act overly girly (though I think even both those things can be done tastefully so long as its abundantly clear to all present that it us done in good humour - just do it in person with people you can trust to be edgy around). But the moral of the idea still stands. Its just clothes. It doesn't let you off the hook for other forms of sexism, but also doesn't mean you are a sexist for wearing them."	2	0

I don’t think it was anything about the cross dressing itself making them that way though, I think that conservative men with strongly patriarchal views are as likely to feel compelled to non-conforming gender expression as anyone else, but if they aren’t able to reconcile their world views to their experience it can have strange results. 

It is not a problem with cross dressing or the hyperfeminine aesthetic or liking romance, feminists are generally about freedom of expression for people of all genders and owning your non-conformity furthers this."	2	0

Default =/= bankruptcy, I had defaulted on down payment which led to a per diem interest rate penalty and also emails from the developer saying they will go to court with this.

I lost some $$$ when I didn’t believe that Cohen dumped everything right away, but fortunately I got out early enough that week so I didn’t lose anything …. I didn’t make what I could have had I sold right away when the rumors hit that he sold all, but I only held onto a few shares just in case something good did happen…and dumped those early last month once the bankruptcy stuff all came out. Save your money and stop making Kenny and his buds wealthier!!!

I'm from Europe and I would like to find someone to control my cock.

15cm, girthy, mostly smooth. I don't show face on cam.

I prefer you just typing, no need to cam or mic.

I'm into edging, cei, cock rings, shoelaces, ruined, denial, light cbt, chastity, nipple play, breath play.

I don't do anal, public, scat/pee, permanent, clothes try-on.

I certainly had a lot of pride in being the Strong Friend and in being almost certain that I could move anything that was in the realm of human strength, eg carrying a fridge. 

And transition meant losing that strength. That’s been hard to adjust to. Men are stronger than me, pretty much all of them.  And that means I have to be careful to protect myself - just like any other woman.

While I know I’ll never be as strong as I once was, I’m still great at sports, I’m still strong, I have excellent cardio, and I can still work on my own fitness goals.  I’ll never carry a fridge up a flight of stairs again but how often do I need to do that?  Even before I transitioned, that level of strength was rarely necessary except to show off.  Nowadays, I do what most women do and we work together when we need to move something heavy. 

On the flip side, I can’t tell you how great it feels for my muscle and fat to look right and feel right. Or how right it feels to be on a par with other athletic women and to be able to work out with them as an equal."	2	0

But ultimately I'd trade that for my true self. I used to be a pretty high level swimmer and so the strength decrease is quite significant I must say. I still have a labouring job (boat building) however so that keeps me fit.	2	0

It's a terrible decision, imo.  For the record, the security deposit is $200. You might think that's a lot, but it really isn't when you consider how overpriced the furniture in the rooms are.

One room barstool is about $200. How somebody actually managed to rope somebody else into paying that much for a cheaply made and cheap looking barstool amazes me. I'm actually used to it though after seeing many ""updates"".  Now, if somebody trashed just the living room?  That would cost an easy $2,000. How much more for the rest of the unit?

There was a running joke in my time in the Army of how we spend $20 for one pencil. I'm not talking literally, of course, but you get the gist. My hotel owner and his ""designer"" makes me scratch my head.

CCs on file are a paper trail that they don't want to leave. If you become the one hotel in town that lets people check-in without a CC then you'll become the #1 destination for drug dealers and sex workers.	50	0

Completely reasonable but, I’m not allowed tk gives refunds “for any reason” so I had to tell him to come back and speak with the manager/owner.

You can immediately tell the relationship between two characters based on what honorifcs they use. And when they aren’t carried over in some way, that is lost. Or even when it’s tried to be maintained it can be goofy. 

Demon slayer has this problem to me, Tanjiro and other characters show respect to the Hashira, and the dub just has them say “Mr. Rengoku” or whatever and it just sounds super forced. Like I’m sorry but in the middle of a life of death battle an English speaker is not going to keep saying Mr. the way Tanjiro does in the dub, it just does not carry the same connotation that San does in japan a lot of times 

Then we could look at Nagatoro, a huge part of that show would be fumbled if they didn’t keep Senpai in the dub. There’s no natural translation an English speaker would use instead of the upperclassman’s name"	1	1

Like if you’re translating a book with instructions on something.

Anime is a story telling medium, there’s nothing wrong with engrossing a viewer in the culture the source comes from. I learned the basic honorifcs from persona 4 all those years ago as a lad, and it was really cool, we didn’t have language options, but I still learned about japan while playing a Japanese game in English 

And a lot of honorifcs dont have a natural translation, or you completely change a character. Nagatoro doesn’t work without using the word Senpai. Having a character use a nickname instead of Chan is not 1:1. A character using Chan doesn’t mean they are the type of character who would use a nickname

So you never answered any of my questions, where is your cutoff for what constitutes as things English speakers “don’t understand” or “sound unnatural”

Do we change every characters names to a western one like 20 years ago? Ichigo Kurosaki sure as hell isn’t a natural sounding name in English, and just reading the name in English doesn’t actually bring over the context of why Kubo chose to name him that, so should he just be changed to Steve White? Your logic is the same kinda thing that got us jelly donuts in Pokémon 20 years ago.

Should every Japanese folklore named attack in naruto be changed because the average English speaker doesn’t know Japanese folklore?

It's a compromise between legroom, headroom, visibility, armrest position, and reach. It doesn't hurt my back anymore, but it does not fit me like a glove like nearly every other car does after finding my sweet spot. Very unusual. Glad it's not my main vehicle.

I got the level 2 autonomy Tech Pack to use as a road trip car with good gas mileage, but I cannot imagine sitting in there for hours with those seats. It's still nice to have for local interstate driving, plus the 360 camera is cool.

Also, the ventilated seats are garbage. I can barely feel them on the highest setting, even in thin, sweaty clothes after leaving the gym, which is like best case scenario for feeling ventilated seats. It feels like the high setting is significantly lower than the low setting on my Durango. I passed on the Track Pack because it deleted ventilated seats (and also because I prefer red leather over black alcantara), but you're not missing out on anything not having ventilated seats."	3	0

Always wondered when loading previous cities why they'd sometimes be a few years backdated or missing some of the newer projects. But recently I lost an entire city that I hadn't made a manual save for yet. 200 hours down the drain. I think I'm done, even though I just bought the plazas and promenades pack and haven't even played with it yet. 😮‍💨	1	0

You’ve been sober for 3 years, that’s a pretty big accomplishment. If she’s still wanting to party like this I don’t think she respects or even understands what that really means for you.

Unfortunately, a lot of men can’t fathom that dommes are complex human beings and not porn avatars that exist at their convenience and never break character.

I get that too, “you can’t be a domme, you’re such a sweetheart!” Like, oh really? You think all women are porn actresses? Do you know any other dommes or are you just going off of the fap fantasy in your head?

He’s putting them on you as something that’s the “norm” (maybe from porn) where there isn’t / shouldn’t be one irl. 

A Domme is a Domme no matter what she wears, how high her pitch it, or how sweet she generally is.

It seems to me this is leaning into kink dispenser territory and that he wants you to act and look a certain way for the fantasy image in his head of what a Domme should be. Or it’s plain manipulation. 

No one, and especially not a sub, should ever bring you down. If you feel “less” because of him, it’s not worth seeing that person in my opinion."	1	0

Im on spectrum too and I feel that rejection dysphoria too. Society is cold and cruel to people who are tad different so ypu learn to be more sensitove because they are blind to your greatness.

I had guy like that too but it was in relationship. He told me that I am not dominant enough. 

What happens is that people have different expectations. Like when you go on a day you have expectations. 
Some men have expectations of what Domme should or shouldn't be.
Sone are just immature as humans so they can't comprehend that Domme doesn't serve them and is only what they think Domme should be. That's not freedom or true Domme.
Nor is he true slave, don't waste time on that leech. 
Plenty guys with open minds who will want to get to know you.

There is no typical domme. All that makes you a domme is that you find pleasure is acts or fantasies of dominance, whatever that means to you.

He's probably watched too much femdom porn and usually in that, you usually get only one type of domme. So he's conditioned to think all Dommes are like that. If that's what he is attracted to (the harsh, domineering type), there's nothing wrong with that. He's entitled to his preferences. However, what's not cool is trying pressure or guilt trip you into being something you naturally is not. 

You two just aren't a good fit. I personally like sweet, nurturing yet protective type of women. I'm not into humiliation, super rough domming stuff. There's nothing against those who like it, tho. You shouldn't let what he said get you down because there's nothing wrong with you. Femdom can be what you want it to be. If someone doesn't align with your way thinking, then it's ok to let them go.

That said, I think soft dommes are much better. As an experienced (and fairly old at 45), I have no interest in the fully performative domme. I really like a BDSM relationship. So I'm not entertaining fantasies of a woman in latex wearing high heels 24x7. I might enjoy the occasional play night where we go all in, but it's not a day to day thing.

With that, I also enjoy a partner who is caring and cuddles, while might also spanking me at naughty times.

I think the whole full domme mode translates to real life BDSM as regular porn translates to real life sex. It might be fun for the occasional play, but if that's your long term fantasy, you're up for a world of disappointment and honestly bad sex.

However, I'll not judge him harshly, he is entitled to his fantasies, maybe he's not a good match to you and that's all. It doesn't invalidate him or you."	1	0

I take vitamines daily, but the C pill was just too big to take with gerd. I left it out, and my symptoms improved quickly. If u want to get C consider the liquid options. I have no probelms with smaller pills like b complex, d, zink etc.	1	0

The one thing I would say is don’t get the JR Pass. It is absolutely not worth it. I haven’t even used 2/3rds of the cost of the pass on Shinkansen tickets if I had bought separately. Almost nothing is JR and available for pass use. All the guides and videos suggest the JR pass is worth it but unless you’re hitting two or three more major cities you won’t break even on it.	1	0

Let’s say you planned a trip that traveled a ton between major cities and the math said you broke even or even saved a couple thousand yen. If your itinerary changes or you drop a city or two off the list, now you’re underwater on the JR Pass paying off. Think about it this way. You’re going to Japan to travel and experience new things, not see the inside of a train car. You have to use the trains so much to  make the pay off worth it it actually forces travel poor decisions.	1	0

I didn't play UDG so Idk bout Monaca. (to be specific, Kubz Scouts didn't play it. but since I'm starting to get back into danganronpa more now, Imma watch another youtuber go through it. Please do recommend me a youtuber who did play UDG)

However, Hiyoko *would* need a babysitter due to her immaturity.

I'm not sure about the monokubs. Their age is... questionable... They act like, and are treated like, children. They have pacifiers. But they also do sexual things (except Monosuke and Monodam, to my knowledge) and are able to do adult things. Monokid is especially confusing age-wise."	1	0

For me it also strongly depends on the dynamic and how experienced someone is to use their voice and tone. 

Personal experience, German words explained in brackets:

Personally I like it when my fiancé calls me ""mein Spielzeug"" (= my toy). ""Fickstück"" (=fuckpiece/fuck toy) and ""Schlampe"" (=slut) are a bordeline case, depending on our mood. Most of the time he just uses ""harmless"" sentences just in a more stern voice or sarcastic tone. Most slurs and phrases are just a huge turn-off or we both feel completely ridiculous.

It actually does double duty by also being simultaneously more degrading.

""You are such a needy little slut- and I love a horny little slut.""

""You like that, my dirty little princess? It takes someone really special to be such a horny fucktoy.""

My other general rules of thumb for degrading talk:
-Subs don't care if you repeat yourself. I'm not saying you shouldn't try and be creative, but you shouldn't stress out because you call her a filthy slut almost every time. I know, I'm a switch. In my relationship where I'm the sub, my Domme often felt bad that she was repeating herself... I was always to horny to notice.

-""And what does that make you?"" is a golden phrase. Point out what she did, or what she wants, or how much she enjoyed something, and then throw that phrase out. ""What do we call someone who..."" also works.

""Oh, you want me to pull your hair when I fuck you from behind? And what does that make you?""

""You like it when I stick my fingers in your ass? What do we call someone who likes such a dirty thing?""

If she doesn't/can't answer you just say ""Awwwww... are you so horny you're unable to think straight. Poor thing."""	1	0

“You need me to suck these fucking tits.”

“I can feel that needy pussy gripping my cock.”

“Look at me while you suck my fucking cock”. 

“I’m going to use this horny pussy. It’s mine.”

Just because she understands dog doors in two places, it doesn't follow that she understands that your yard is the place to poop.  The dog door is a red herring.

Do you have a third place yet?  (Not home, not work, a more social space). 

If not, it’s worth trying a hobby and a restaurant weekly until you find someplace that feels homey.  Go to the same place on the same night 3 times, and you’ll likely have the locals start to gradually consider you a regular.

Even if you have disorders, you can still find friends.  However it can help to have your therapist  give you a hint about the kind of disorder, it can help you find your people."	1	0

Then if you find yourself clicking with someone attempt friendship, don't always be the one reaching out either. You need that friendship to be real and not a one sided type of thing or else it will continually fail.	1	0

And that’s what everyone markets for. I’d say a lot of these companies are scams like moxie, relay direct, blue tide. They’re tied to Inspire 212 and VP promotions. Please look at the reviews online. You can also watch The Slave Circle on YouTube like the reviews recommend. I’d suggest going to the interview and asking hard questions like how much they earn, what their tie is to VP and 212 and how much they get per year just to throw them off haha. Honestly when I did my interview and asked questions like why they constantly hire etc they couldn’t give me a straight answer. I didn’t respond after the third round of interviews. You can find anything on government websites about the company either. I’d suggest you don’t get involved with them	1	0

It is hard to get momentum when you have to challenge every other play. The game would not have been this close otherwise. And the announcers…. I mean come on.

Purdue is a great team, they are going to be tough over the next few years. Really love how Harper Murray battled through a tough game early on to dominate the 5th set. That is what superstars do.

Murray, Allick, Beason and Reilly really dragged the team to the finish. I love how stable of a presence Reilly is. I knew she was going to be a day one starter here, but I didn't think she was going to be this polished. She made some mistakes, but she battled. If your setter starts to get in over her head, the rest goes to hell. She hung in, put some great sets up and Murray and Beason did the rest. Reilly had a few kills of her own too.

Going five in the first of a back to back is always a concern and Indiana is looking fairly sharp early this season, but the good news is they survived day one.

Now, as for the officiating. That is one of the worst officiated volleyball matches I have ever seen. It would be one thing if there just happened to be a bunch of really tough calls in a five set match. It happens, but that isn't what happened here. Nearly every single one of the misses weren't particularly close. Even on the correctly officiated calls, it seemed like this officiating crew was in over their heads. There was one play the down referee just didn't make a call. Any call. Everyone was looking and he didn't know which way to point. Ugly.

The Big Ten Network wasn't much better. The announcers were so out of touch with what was happening I was starting to wonder if they were broadcasting from a studio and not the gym. Maybe they were and if they were it is the conference that should be criticized not the crew, but the crew was wrong on nearly every single point. Misidentifying players, misidentifying what was happening, totally ignoring the officiating mistakes. 

Oh and the graphics department put ""tomorrow's"" football schedule on the screen but it was last week's schedule (Nebraska playing LaTech) and misspelled multiple players names in graphics. The entire night felt like the Big Ten interns were calling, producing and officiating the match while two really great teams played."	1	0

They were missing obvious calls, they were in the wrong position a few times and they were dramatically impacting the flow of the game.

It would have been one thing if they were just getting hit with a string of really tight 50/50 calls but I can't say a single one of the missed calls tonight was particularly close. They also didn't review another missed call on a Purdue serve that was clearly out but John Cook didn't want to risk losing the challenge, probably because he knew he'd need it and he was right, he challenged the very next play (which was also wrong).

Will this crew be held accountable? I doubt it!"	1	0

I think the Big Ten, as a whole, does a tremendous job producing volleyball but whatever crew and production team it had on this game tonight was roughly as good at their jobs as the officials.

The level of play on the court was miles and miles above anything the Big Ten did during the production, announcing and officiating of that game and it is really a shame for both programs involved."	1	0

If the wan is just dhcp then it will work after a reset by creating a dhcp client on the wan port (the default config does this).

Without knowing what wan method is being used it’s risky to perform a reset. 

Theoretically you could sniff the traffic on the wan with another device when the router connects to find out what it’s doing. I can’t remember whether pppoe auth is plain text but if it is you may be able to recover the login details in that case."	2	0

He got big in India because ZGH and Humsafar became viral in India at the time. I was introduced to Pakistani dramas because of Humsafar years ago before he came to India. All my aunts were also swooning over him. He has an aura that’s hard to ignore nor forget- hence him still being a heartthrob to millions even when he’s not in the limelight or in the media.

My point was that even if sin was perfect, pi is not accurate enough (it doesn't require infinite memory) to produce an answer of 0 without rounding.

Floating point math is just messy.  People accepted it on old calculators because they have never looked closely enough.  It's only when you really pay attention that you find ""errors"".  Early programmers then ask why 0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3, when everyone else just ignores it and doesn't check for exactness.

For BigFloat is gets you its default 256 bit, float (which is enough for all proctical purposes, even Float64, or just Float32 pi), but if you set BigFloat's precision higher I thought you would not get more accurate pi (though you could calculate it), but seemingly I confirmed I did. I got more digits, and a different value. You are of course limited by what you can store in memory...	1	0

Communism is antithetical to their extremely capitalist platform. The GOP does not want unions, and they certainly don't want workers collectively owning their workplace. They don't even support raising the minimum wage. Capitalism is incompatible with communism. They are diametrically opposed economic systems.

If you mean ""republican"" as in ""someone who supports representative democracy"", then that would be a much softer no. While many communists and socialists support an eventual or immediate abolition of the state, democracy is still a shared value between lowercase republicans and communists. There can be much more cooperation here, although most republicans are still at least somewhat capitalist.

Hope this helps."	1	0

The left and right are largely useless distinctions because they can mean different things in different contexts.

Liberals are nationalist, capitalist, and reformist. All things communists are not. Communists are internationalist, anti-capitalist, and revolutionary.

I highly recommend reading [Manifesto of the Communist Party by Karl Marx and Freidrich Engels](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/), [Principles of Communism by Freidrich Engels](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/11/prin-com.htm), [Why Socialism? by Albert Einstein](https://monthlyreview.org/2009/05/01/why-socialism/), and [Socialism and Anarchism by Anton Pannekoek](https://www.marxists.org/archive/pannekoe/1913/socialism-anarchism.htm). These are all very short and easy to read works which thoroughly explain the communist position. It may take a while to get used to the dry academic writing style of political theory, but it gets easier to read the more political theory you do read.

In short the communist position is as such:

Historically, the oppressed classes have fought against the oppressing classes. This has happened time and time again quite predictably. Modern capitalist society is composed of two classes which developed from feudal monarchies and slave societies: the bourgeois and the proletariat. The bourgeoisie are those who own the means of production and the proletarians are those who have to work under the bourgeoisie because they don't own the means of production. Because history has continually shown that the lower classes inevitably revolt against the upper classes, the proletariat will eventually overthrow the bourgeoisie. In doing so they will abolish class, currency, and the state because those are all tools of the bourgeoisie to oppress the proletarians."	3	0

Communism seeks to overthrow the government of the capital owners, while left capital politicians like democrats, ( who needless to say are themselves representatives of the capital owners)  seeks only to (at best) redistribute wealth, mostly drawing from petty capital owners and leaving the corporate overlords untouched, in order to drive up the consumption of commodities. After all, capitalism only works by the sale of commodities, which communism completely wishes to do away with. 
 
The goals of communism can only be achieved outside of the corrupt bourgeois state. Which is why we refrain from electoralism and spend our time focusing on union efforts and independent organizing."	2	0
